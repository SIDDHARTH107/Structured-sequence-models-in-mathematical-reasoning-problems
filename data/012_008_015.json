    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G is planar or non-planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nv - e + f = 2\n\nwhere v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.\n\nIn our case, we have v = 7 and e = 10. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the number of faces:\n\nf = 2 - v + e = 2 - 7 + 10 = 5\n\nNow, we can use the inequality derived from the Handshaking lemma for planar graphs:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nPlugging in our values:\n\n10 ≤ 3(7) - 6\n10 ≤ 21 - 6\n10 ≤ 15\n\nThe inequality holds true, so it is possible that the graph G is planar. However, we still need to check if we can draw it on a plane without any edges crossing over each other.\n\nLet's try to draw the graph G:\n\n1. Start with a vertex (A) and connect it to three other vertices (B, C, D).\n2. Connect vertex B to vertices C and D.\n3. Connect vertex C to vertex D.\n4. Add a new vertex E and connect it to vertices B and C.\n5. Add a new vertex F and connect it to vertices C and D.\n6. Add a new vertex G and connect it to vertices B and D.\n\nNow we have a graph with 7 vertices and 10 edges without any edge crossings. Therefore, the graph G is planar."
