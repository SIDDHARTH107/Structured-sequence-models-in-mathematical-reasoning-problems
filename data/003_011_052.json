    "message_1": "A person is standing 100 meters away from the base of a building. If the person looks up at an angle of 60 degrees, what is the height of the building? (Assume the person's eye level is at ground level.)",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the person to the building (100 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 100 meters\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3, so:\n\n√3 = height / 100 meters\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 100 meters * √3 ≈ 100 meters * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 173.2 meters\n\nTherefore, the height of the building is approximately 173.2 meters."
