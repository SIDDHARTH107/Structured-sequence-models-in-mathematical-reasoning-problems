    "message_2": "To find the degree of the rational curve given by the parametrization, we need to eliminate the parameter $t$ and obtain an equation in $x$ and $y$.\n\nWe are given:\n$$x = t^2 - 1$$\n$$y = t^3 - t$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for $t^2$:\n$$t^2 = x + 1$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $t^2$ into the second equation to eliminate $t$. Notice that $t^3 - t = t(t^2 - 1)$, so we have:\n$$y = t(t^2 - 1)$$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $t^2$:\n$$y = t(x + 1 - 1)$$\n$$y = tx$$\n\nNow, we need to eliminate $t$. We can do this by solving for $t$ in the first equation and substituting it into the second equation. From the first equation, we have:\n$$t^2 = x + 1$$\n$$t = \\pm\\sqrt{x + 1}$$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $t$ into the second equation:\n$$y = (\\pm\\sqrt{x + 1})x$$\n\nNow, we have an equation in $x$ and $y$:\n$$y = \\pm x\\sqrt{x + 1}$$\n\nThis equation represents a rational curve. To find the degree of this curve, we need to find the highest power of $x$ or $y$ in the equation. In this case, the highest power of $x$ is $x^{3/2}$, which means the degree of the rational curve is $\\boxed{3/2}$."
