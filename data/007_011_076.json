To find all the quadratic residues modulo 19, we will calculate the squares of the numbers from 1 to 9 (half of 19, rounded down) and then reduce them modulo 19.\n\n1. 1² = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 19)\n2. 2² = 4 ≡ 4 (mod 19)\n3. 3² = 9 ≡ 9 (mod 19)\n4. 4² = 16 ≡ 16 (mod 19)\n5. 5² = 25 ≡ 6 (mod 19)\n6. 6² = 36 ≡ 17 (mod 19)\n7. 7² = 49 ≡ 11 (mod 19)\n8. 8² = 64 ≡ 7 (mod 19)\n9. 9² = 81 ≡ 5 (mod 19)\n\nSo, the quadratic residues modulo 19 are {1, 4, 9, 16, 6, 17, 11, 7, 5}."
