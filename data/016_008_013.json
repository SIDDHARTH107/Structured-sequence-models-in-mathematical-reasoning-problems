    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/S)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, N = 4 (since it is generated by four iterations) and the scaling factor S = 1/3 (as given in the problem).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension D can be calculated as:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nTherefore, the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve generated by four iterations with a scaling factor of 1/3 and an angle of 60 degrees is approximately 1.2619."
