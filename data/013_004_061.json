The husband wants to go to a basketball game, while the wife prefers to go to an opera. The payoffs are shown in the matrix below:\n\n|     | Basketball | Opera |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Basketball** | 2,1 | 0,0 |\n| **Opera** | 0,0 | 1,2 |\n\nIf both the husband and wife choose their preferred option, what is the combined payoff?",
    "message_2": "If the husband and wife both choose their preferred option, the husband chooses Basketball and the wife chooses Opera. In this case, they will not be attending the same event, and the payoffs are (0,0) for both. The combined payoff is 0 + 0 = 0."
