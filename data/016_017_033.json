    "message_2": "The Heighway Dragon curve is a fractal curve that is created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold is at a right angle. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nAfter each iteration, the total length of the Heighway Dragon curve is doubled. So, after 10 iterations, the length of the curve will be:\n\nLength = Initial length * 2^Number of iterations\n\nLength = 1 * 2^10\n\nLength = 1 * 1024\n\nLength = 1024 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway Dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1024 units."
