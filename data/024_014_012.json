    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of V with respect to W, we use the Lie bracket [W, V], which is defined as [W, V] = WV - VW. Here, WV and VW denote the action of W on V and V on W, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's compute WV:\n\nWV = (2x∂/∂x - y∂/∂y)(x∂/∂x + y∂/∂y)\n\n= 2x(∂/∂x)(x∂/∂x) + 2x(∂/∂x)(y∂/∂y) - y(∂/∂y)(x∂/∂x) - y(∂/∂y)(y∂/∂y)\n\n= 2x(1∂/∂x) + 2x(y∂²/∂x∂y) - y(x∂²/∂y∂x) - y(1∂/∂y)\n\n= 2x∂/∂x + 2xy∂²/∂x∂y - yx∂²/∂y∂x - y∂/∂y\n\nNow, let's compute VW:\n\nVW = (x∂/∂x + y∂/∂y)(2x∂/∂x - y∂/∂y)\n\n= x(∂/∂x)(2x∂/∂x) + x(∂/∂x)(-y∂/∂y) + y(∂/∂y)(2x∂/∂x) + y(∂/∂y)(-y∂/∂y)\n\n= x(2∂/∂x) - xy∂²/∂x∂y + 2xy∂²/∂y∂x - y(1∂/∂y)\n\n= 2x∂/∂x - xy∂²/∂x∂y + 2xy∂²/∂y∂x - y∂/∂y\n\nNow we can compute the Lie bracket [W, V] = WV - VW:\n\n[W, V] = (2x∂/∂x + 2xy∂²/∂x∂y - yx∂²/∂y∂x - y∂/∂y) - (2x∂/∂x - xy∂²/∂x∂y + 2xy∂²/∂y∂x - y∂/∂y)\n\n= 2xy∂²/∂x∂y - yx∂²/∂y∂x - xy∂²/∂x∂y + 2xy∂²/∂y∂x\n\n= xy∂²/∂y∂x\n\nFinally, we evaluate the Lie derivative at the point (1,1):\n\nLie derivative of V with respect to W at (1,1) = (1,1)∂²/∂y∂x = ∂²/∂y∂x\n\nThus, the Lie derivative of V with respect to W at the point (1,1) is ∂²/∂y∂x."
