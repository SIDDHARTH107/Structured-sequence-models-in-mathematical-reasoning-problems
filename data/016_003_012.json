    "message_2": "The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is shaped like a heart, and its area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a cardioid:\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * a^2\n\nwhere a is the radius of the cardioid. Since the diameter is given as 2 units, the radius is half of that, which is 1 unit.\n\nArea = (1/2) * π * (1)^2\nArea = (1/2) * π * 1\nArea = (1/2) * π\n\nArea ≈ (1/2) * 3.14\nArea ≈ 1.57\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is approximately 1.57 square units, rounded to the nearest tenth."
