    "message_1": "A stream cipher produces a keystream of bits that are combined with the plaintext message to produce a ciphertext message. The keystream is generated by a shift register that repeats after a length of time. \n\nSuppose a stream cipher uses a feedback shift register with a length of 8 bits and an initial value of 00000001. The output of the feedback function is the XOR of the 4th and 8th bit positions. What is the keystream after 10 clock cycles?",
