    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence of the power series, we can use the Ratio Test. Let's consider the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(x-3)^{n+1}}{(n+1)^3}}{\\frac{(x-3)^n}{n^3}}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-3)n^3}{(n+1)^3}\\right|$$\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-3)n^3}{(n+1)^3}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x-3)}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^3}\\right| = |x-3|$$\n\nFor the series to converge, the limit must be less than 1:\n\n$$|x-3| < 1$$\n\nThis inequality represents the interval of convergence. To find the endpoints, we can set the absolute value equal to 1:\n\n$$|x-3| = 1$$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x:\n\n$$x-3 = 1 \\Rightarrow x = 4$$\n$$x-3 = -1 \\Rightarrow x = 2$$\n\nNow, we need to test the endpoints to see if they are included in the interval of convergence. For x = 4, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1^n}{n^3} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}$$\n\nThis is a convergent p-series with p = 3 > 1. Therefore, x = 4 is included in the interval of convergence.\n\nFor x = 2, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n^3}$$\n\nThis is an alternating series, and we can apply the Alternating Series Test. The terms are decreasing in magnitude, and the limit of the terms as n goes to infinity is 0:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} = 0$$\n\nTherefore, the series converges for x = 2, and x = 2 is included in the interval of convergence.\n\nSo, the interval of convergence is [2, 4], and the radius of convergence is:\n\n$$R = \\frac{4 - 2}{2} = 1$$\n\nIn conclusion, the radius of convergence is 1, and the interval of convergence is [2, 4]."
