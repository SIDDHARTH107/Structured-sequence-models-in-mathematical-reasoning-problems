    "message_2": "A Gosper curve is a fractal curve, and its perimeter length increases with each iteration. The perimeter of a Gosper curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial Side Length * (Length Multiplier)^n\n\nFor a Gosper curve, the length multiplier is √(7). We are given the initial side length (10 units) and the desired perimeter length (100 units). We can now set up the equation:\n\n100 = 10 * (√7)^n\n\nTo find the value of n, we can divide both sides by 10:\n\n10 = (√7)^n\n\nNow, we can take the logarithm of both sides to solve for n:\n\nlog(10) = n * log(√7)\n\nn = log(10) / log(√7)\n\nn ≈ 2.183\n\nSince n must be an integer (as it represents the number of iterations), we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3. Therefore, the parameter value \"n\" required to create a Gosper curve with a perimeter length of 100 units and an initial side length of 10 units is approximately 3."
