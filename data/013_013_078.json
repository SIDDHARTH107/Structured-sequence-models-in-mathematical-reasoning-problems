    "message_2": "In a sealed bid first-price auction, each bidder submits a bid without knowing the bids of the other participants. The highest bidder wins the auction and pays their bid price. To calculate the expected revenue, we need to consider the possible bidding strategies of the bidders.\n\nLet's assume that each bidder bids a fraction of their valuation. Bidder 1 bids x1 * $10,000, Bidder 2 bids x2 * $15,000, and Bidder 3 bids x3 * $20,000, where 0 < x1, x2, x3 <= 1.\n\nIn order for Bidder 1 to win, their bid must be higher than the bids of Bidders 2 and 3. This means that x1 * $10,000 > x2 * $15,000 and x1 * $10,000 > x3 * $20,000. However, since Bidder 1's valuation is lower than the other bidders, it's impossible for them to win without overbidding their valuation, which is not a rational strategy.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where Bidder 2 wins. In this case, x2 * $15,000 > x1 * $10,000 and x2 * $15,000 > x3 * $20,000. The first inequality is always true since Bidder 1 cannot win. The second inequality simplifies to x2 > (2/3) * x3. \n\nFinally, let's consider the case where Bidder 3 wins. In this case, x3 * $20,000 > x1 * $10,000 and x3 * $20,000 > x2 * $15,000. The first inequality is always true since Bidder 1 cannot win. The second inequality simplifies to x3 > (3/4) * x2.\n\nNow, we need to find the probabilities of each case. Since Bidder 1 cannot win, the probability of Bidder 2 winning is the probability that x2 > (2/3) * x3, and the probability of Bidder 3 winning is the probability that x3 > (3/4) * x2. Assuming that x2 and x3 are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, the probability of Bidder 2 winning is 1/3, and the probability of Bidder 3 winning is 2/3.\n\nThe expected revenue for the seller is the sum of the expected revenues in each case. For Bidder 2 winning, the expected revenue is (1/3) * $15,000 = $5,000. For Bidder 3 winning, the expected revenue is (2/3) * $20,000 = $13,333.33. Therefore, the total expected revenue for the seller is $5,000 + $13,333.33 = $18,333.33."
