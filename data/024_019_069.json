    "message_1": "Let S be the surface obtained by rotating the curve y=x^2/4, between x=1 and x=3, about the x-axis. Calculate the Gauss curvature of S using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Gauss curvature of the surface S, we first need to parameterize the surface. Let's use the following parameterization:\n\nx(u, v) = u\ny(u, v) = (u^2/4) * cos(v)\nz(u, v) = (u^2/4) * sin(v)\n\nwhere 1 ≤ u ≤ 3 and 0 ≤ v ≤ 2π.\n\nNow, we need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. The first fundamental form is given by the metric tensor:\n\ng_ij = <x_i, x_j>\n\nwhere x_i and x_j are the partial derivatives of x with respect to u and v. We have:\n\nx_u = (1, u/2 * cos(v), u/2 * sin(v))\nx_v = (0, -(u^2/4) * sin(v), (u^2/4) * cos(v))\n\nNow, we compute the metric tensor:\n\ng_11 = <x_u, x_u> = 1 + (u^2/4) * (cos^2(v) + sin^2(v)) = 1 + u^2/4\ng_12 = g_21 = <x_u, x_v> = 0\ng_22 = <x_v, x_v> = (u^2/4)^2 * (sin^2(v) + cos^2(v)) = u^4/16\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the shape tensor:\n\nb_ij = -<x_i, N_j>\n\nwhere N is the unit normal vector to the surface. We first compute the normal vector:\n\nN = x_u × x_v = (u^3/8 * cos(v), u/2 * sin(v), -u/2 * cos(v))\n\nNow, we normalize N:\n\n|N| = sqrt((u^3/8 * cos(v))^2 + (u/2 * sin(v))^2 + (-u/2 * cos(v))^2) = u/2\n\nSo, the unit normal vector is:\n\nN = (u^2/4 * cos(v), sin(v), -cos(v))\n\nNow, we compute the shape tensor:\n\nb_11 = -<x_uu, N> = 0\nb_12 = b_21 = -<x_uv, N> = -<(-u/2 * cos(v), cos(v), sin(v)), (u^2/4 * cos(v), sin(v), -cos(v))> = u/2\nb_22 = -<x_vv, N> = -<(-(u^2/4) * cos(v), -u/2 * sin^2(v), -u/2 * sin(v) * cos(v)), (u^2/4 * cos(v), sin(v), -cos(v))> = -u^2/4\n\nNow, we can compute the Gauss curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (b_11 * b_22 - b_12 * b_21) / (g_11 * g_22 - g_12 * g_21)\n\nK = (0 * (-u^2/4) - (u/2) * (u/2)) / ((1 + u^2/4) * (u^4/16) - 0)\n\nK = -u^2/4 / (u^6/64 + u^4/16)\n\nK = -64u^2 / (16u^6 + 64u^4)\n\nK = -u^2 / (u^6 + 4u^4)\n\nThis is the Gauss curvature of the surface S at any point (u, v). Note that the Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the integral of the Gauss curvature over a surface to the total geodesic curvature of its boundary, but in this case, we were asked to compute the Gauss curvature itself, not its integral."
