    "message_2": "The largest circle that can be inscribed inside the Mandelbrot set is known as the \"main cardioid\" of the set. The equation for the main cardioid is given by:\n\nr(θ) = (1 - cos(θ))/2\n\nTo find the area of the largest inscribed circle, we need to find the maximum value of r(θ). The maximum value of r(θ) occurs when θ = π, so:\n\nr_max = (1 - cos(π))/2 = (1 - (-1))/2 = 1\n\nSince the maximum radius is 1, the area of the largest inscribed circle is:\n\nArea = π * r_max^2 = π * 1^2 = π\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the area is approximately 3.14 square units."
