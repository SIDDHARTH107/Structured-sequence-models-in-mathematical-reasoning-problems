    "message_1": "In a substitution cipher, the letter \"A\" is always replaced by the letter \"D\", the letter \"B\" is always replaced by the letter \"G\", and the letter \"C\" is always replaced by the letter \"F\", and so on. Using this cipher, what letter does the letter \"R\" get replaced with?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the pattern of the substitution cipher. We can see that the letter \"A\" (1st letter of the alphabet) is replaced by the letter \"D\" (4th letter of the alphabet), \"B\" (2nd letter) is replaced by \"G\" (7th letter), and \"C\" (3rd letter) is replaced by \"F\" (6th letter).\n\nIt appears that each letter is replaced by the letter that is 3 positions ahead in the alphabet. To confirm this pattern, let's look at the next letter, \"D\" (4th letter). If we move 3 positions ahead, we get \"G\" (7th letter), which is consistent with the pattern.\n\nNow, let's apply this pattern to the letter \"R\". \"R\" is the 18th letter of the alphabet. If we move 3 positions ahead, we get the 21st letter, which is \"U\". Therefore, in this substitution cipher, the letter \"R\" is replaced by the letter \"U\"."
