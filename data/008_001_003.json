Write the given system of linear equations in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n2. Find the inverse of matrix A.\n3. Multiply the inverse of matrix A with matrix B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nStep 1: Write the given system of linear equations in matrix form AX = B\n\nA = | 2  3  1 |\n    | 1  4  2 |\n    | 3  2 -4 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  7  |\n    | 10  |\n    | -2  |\n\nStep 2: Find the inverse of matrix A\n\nTo find the inverse of matrix A, we will first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = 2(4(-4) - 2(2)) - 3(1(-4) - 2(2)) + 1(1(2) - 4(3))\n       = 2(-16 - 4) - 3(-4 - 4) + 1(2 - 12)\n       = 2(-20) + 3(8) - 10\n       = -40 + 24 - 10\n       = -26\n\nSince the determinant of A is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we will find the adjoint of A and then divide each element by the determinant to get the inverse.\n\nadj(A) = |  8  -6   8 |\n         | -6   2   3 |\n         |  4   3  -2 |\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-26) * |  8  -6   8 |\n                   | -6   2   3 |\n                   |  4   3  -2 |\n\nStep 3: Multiply the inverse of matrix A with matrix B to get the solution matrix X\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = (1/-26) * |  8  -6   8 | * |  7  |\n              | -6   2   3 |   | 10  |\n              |  4   3  -2 |   | -2  |\n\nX = | (-26x - 42y + 56z) / -26 |\n    | ( 42x + 20y -  6z) / -26 |\n    | (-28x - 30y + 52z) / -26 |\n\nSolving for x, y, and z:\n\nx = (-26x - 42y + 56z) / -26\ny = ( 42x + 20y -  6z) / -26\nz = (-28x - 30y + 52z) / -26\n\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = -1\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = -1."
