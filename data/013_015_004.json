    "message_1": "A company hires a manager to make decisions on behalf of the company. The manager's own interests might not align with the company's interests, and the company wants to incentivize the manager to make decisions that are best for the company. The company offers the manager a bonus if the company's profits reach a certain level, and the manager's effort affects the level of profits that the company earns. The manager's effort is modeled as a number between 0 and 10, and the company's profits are modeled as follows: \n\nProfits = 100*(Manager's Effort) - (Manager's Effort)^2\n\nThe bonus that the company offers is $10,000. What level of effort should the manager put in to maximize the expected value of his or her total compensation (salary + bonus)?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the expected value of the manager's total compensation, we need to find the level of effort that maximizes the company's profits. We can do this by finding the maximum point of the profit function.\n\nThe profit function is given by:\n\nProfits = 100 * (Manager's Effort) - (Manager's Effort)^2\n\nLet's denote Manager's Effort as x. So, the profit function becomes:\n\nProfits = 100x - x^2\n\nTo find the maximum point of this function, we can take the first derivative with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profits)/dx = 100 - 2x\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for x:\n\n100 - 2x = 0\n2x = 100\nx = 50\n\nHowever, the problem states that the manager's effort is a number between 0 and 10. Since 50 is outside of this range, we need to check the endpoints of the interval [0, 10] to find the maximum profit.\n\nWhen x = 0 (no effort), the profit is:\n\nProfits = 100(0) - (0)^2 = 0\n\nWhen x = 10 (maximum effort), the profit is:\n\nProfits = 100(10) - (10)^2 = 1000 - 100 = 900\n\nSince the profit is higher when the manager puts in the maximum effort (x = 10), the manager should put in an effort level of 10 to maximize the expected value of his or her total compensation (salary + bonus)."
