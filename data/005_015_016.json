    "message_1": "A company has gathered data on the salaries and years of experience of their employees. The data set includes 50 employees. The company wants to group the employees based on their salaries and years of experience. Use cluster analysis to group the data into three clusters. \n\nThe data set is available in a CSV file named \"employee_data.csv\" which contains two columns: \"salary\" and \"years_of_experience\". Write a Python code that reads this file and groups the employees into three clusters using k-means clustering algorithm.",
    "message_2": "To perform k-means clustering on the given data, we will use the pandas library to read the CSV file and the scikit-learn library to perform the clustering. Here's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Read the CSV file\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"employee_data.csv\")\n\n# Extract the columns \"salary\" and \"years_of_experience\"\nX = data[[\"salary\", \"years_of_experience\"]]\n\n# Perform k-means clustering with 3 clusters\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0).fit(X)\n\n# Assign the cluster labels to the data\ndata[\"cluster\"] = kmeans.labels_\n\n# Print the grouped data\nprint(data)\n\n# Plot the clusters\nplt.scatter(data[\"salary\"], data[\"years_of_experience\"], c=data[\"cluster\"], cmap=\"viridis\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Salary\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Years of Experience\")\nplt.title(\"Employee Clustering\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code reads the \"employee_data.csv\" file, extracts the \"salary\" and \"years_of_experience\" columns, and performs k-means clustering with 3 clusters. The resulting cluster labels are added to the data, and the data is printed. Finally, the clusters are visualized using a scatter plot."
