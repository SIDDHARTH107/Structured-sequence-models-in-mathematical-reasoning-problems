    "message_2": "To determine whether a graph with the given degree sequence can be constructed, we can use the Handshaking Lemma and the Havel-Hakimi algorithm.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 18. Since 18 is an even number, the Handshaking Lemma is satisfied, and we can proceed to the Havel-Hakimi algorithm.\n\nThe Havel-Hakimi algorithm is used to check if a given degree sequence is graphical, i.e., if there exists a graph with that degree sequence. The algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Sort the degree sequence in non-increasing order.\n2. Remove the first element (the largest degree) from the sequence, and reduce the next k elements by 1, where k is the removed element (the largest degree).\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the sequence is empty or the algorithm fails.\n\nApplying the Havel-Hakimi algorithm to the given degree sequence:\n\n1. Sorted sequence: 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2\n2. Remove 4 and reduce the next 4 elements: 3, 2, 1, 1, 2\n3. Sort the sequence: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1\n4. Remove 3 and reduce the next 3 elements: 1, 1, 0, 1\n5. Sort the sequence: 1, 1, 1, 0\n6. Remove 1 and reduce the next 1 element: 0, 1, 0\n7. Sort the sequence: 1, 0, 0\n8. Remove 1 and reduce the next 1 element: -1, 0\n\nAt this point, we have a negative degree (-1), which is not possible in a graph. Therefore, the Havel-Hakimi algorithm fails, and the given degree sequence cannot be used to construct a graph."
