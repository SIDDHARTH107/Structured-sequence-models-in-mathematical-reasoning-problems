    "message_2": "To solve the given PDE using complex analysis techniques, we will use the method of conformal mapping. The given PDE is Laplace's equation, and the solution u(x, y) is a harmonic function. We will map the rectangle [0, 1] x [0, 1] to the upper half-plane and find a harmonic function there that satisfies the transformed boundary conditions.\n\nFirst, we need to find a conformal mapping from the rectangle to the upper half-plane. One such mapping is given by the Schwarz-Christoffel formula:\n\n$w = f(z) = \\int^z \\frac{1}{(1 - \\zeta^2)^{1/2}} d\\zeta$\n\nThis maps the rectangle to the upper half-plane with the corners of the rectangle mapped to 0, 1, âˆž, and -1. The mapping preserves angles and maps the boundary of the rectangle to the real axis.\n\nNow, we need to find a harmonic function in the upper half-plane that satisfies the transformed boundary conditions. Let's denote the transformed function as v(w) = u(f^{-1}(w)). The boundary conditions become:\n\n$v(w) = 0$ for $w = 0, 1$\n\n$v(w) = \\Re(w)$ for $w$ on the real axis and $0 < w < 1$\n\n$v(w) = \\Re(w) - 1$ for $w$ on the real axis and $1 < w$\n\nWe can use the method of images to find a harmonic function that satisfies these conditions. Consider the function:\n\n$v(w) = \\Re(w) - \\Re(\\frac{1}{w}) - \\Re(\\frac{1}{w - 1})$\n\nThis function is harmonic in the upper half-plane and satisfies the boundary conditions. Now, we need to find the inverse of the conformal mapping to obtain the solution u(x, y) in the original coordinates. The inverse mapping is given by:\n\n$z = f^{-1}(w) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi w}{2})$\n\nThus, the solution to the PDE is:\n\n$u(x, y) = v(f^{-1}(x + iy)) = \\Re(\\sin(\\frac{\\pi (x + iy)}{2})) - \\Re(\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\frac{\\pi (x + iy)}{2})}) - \\Re(\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\frac{\\pi (x + iy)}{2}) - 1})$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$u(x, y) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{2})\\cosh(\\frac{\\pi y}{2}) - \\frac{\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{2})\\cosh(\\frac{\\pi y}{2})}{\\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi x}{2}) + \\sinh^2(\\frac{\\pi y}{2})} - \\frac{\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{2})\\cosh(\\frac{\\pi y}{2})}{(\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{2}) - 1)^2 + \\sinh^2(\\frac{\\pi y}{2})}$\n\nThis is the solution to the given PDE using complex analysis techniques."
