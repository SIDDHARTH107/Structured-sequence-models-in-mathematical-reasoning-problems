    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x² + 5x - 2, we will integrate the function with respect to x. \n\nThe antiderivative F(x) is given by:\n\nF(x) = ∫(3x² + 5x - 2) dx\n\nWe will integrate each term separately:\n\n∫(3x²) dx = 3∫(x²) dx = 3(x³/3) = x³\n\n∫(5x) dx = 5∫(x) dx = 5(x²/2) = (5/2)x²\n\n∫(-2) dx = -2∫(1) dx = -2x\n\nNow, we combine the results and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nF(x) = x³ + (5/2)x² - 2x + C"
