    "message_2": "The statement that every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers is known as the Goldbach Conjecture. This conjecture has not been proven or disproven, but it has been tested extensively for even numbers up to very large values, and it holds true for all tested cases. Therefore, there is currently no known smallest even number greater than 2 that cannot be written as the sum of two prime numbers."
