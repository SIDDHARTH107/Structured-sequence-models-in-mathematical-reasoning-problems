    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 at the point P = (0, 1/√2, 1/√2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\n\nS(u, v) = (sin(u)cos(v), sin(u)sin(v), cos(u))\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\n\nS_u = (∂S/∂u) = (cos(u)cos(v), cos(u)sin(v), -sin(u))\nS_v = (∂S/∂v) = (-sin(u)sin(v), sin(u)cos(v), 0)\n\nNext, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = <S_u, S_u> = cos^2(u)cos^2(v) + cos^2(u)sin^2(v) + sin^2(u) = cos^2(u) + sin^2(u) = 1\nF = <S_u, S_v> = -cos(u)sin(u)cos^2(v) + cos(u)sin(u)sin^2(v) = 0\nG = <S_v, S_v> = sin^2(u)sin^2(v) + sin^2(u)cos^2(v) = sin^2(u)\n\nNow, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nS_uu = (-sin(u)cos(v), -sin(u)sin(v), -cos(u))\nS_uv = (-cos(u)sin(v), cos(u)cos(v), 0)\nS_vv = (-sin(u)cos(v), -sin(u)sin(v), 0)\n\nNext, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = <N, S_uu> = -sin(u)cos(v) + sin(u)sin(v) - cos(u)\nM = <N, S_uv> = cos(u)sin(v) + cos(u)cos(v)\nN = <N, S_vv> = -sin(u)cos(v) - sin(u)sin(v)\n\nHere, N is the normal vector to the surface at point P, which can be computed as the cross product of S_u and S_v:\n\nN = S_u × S_v = (cos(u)sin(v), -cos(u)cos(v), sin^2(u))\n\nAt point P = (0, 1/√2, 1/√2), we have sin(u) = 1/√2 and cos(u) = 1/√2. So, the normal vector N = (1/2, -1/2, 1/2).\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form coefficients at point P:\n\nL = <N, S_uu> = -1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2 = -1/2\nM = <N, S_uv> = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1\nN = <N, S_vv> = -1/2 - 1/2 = -1\n\nFinally, we can compute the mean curvature H:\n\nH = (1/2) * (EG - F^2)^(-1) * (LE + 2MFG + NG^2)\nH = (1/2) * (1 * sin^2(u) - 0^2)^(-1) * (-1/2 * 1 + 2 * 1 * 0 * sin^2(u) + (-1) * sin^4(u))\n\nAt point P, sin^2(u) = 1/2, so:\n\nH = (1/2) * (1/2)^(-1) * (-1/2 + 0 - 1/4) = -3/4\n\nTherefore, the mean curvature of the surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 at the point P = (0, 1/√2, 1/√2) is -3/4."
