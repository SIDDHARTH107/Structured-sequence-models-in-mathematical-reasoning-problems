    "message_2": "To graph the equation f(x) = |3x - 5|, we'll first need to determine the critical points and the general shape of the graph. Since this is an absolute value function, the graph will have a V-shape.\n\n1. Find the vertex (the point where the graph changes direction):\n\nThe vertex occurs where the expression inside the absolute value equals zero. So, we'll set 3x - 5 = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x - 5 = 0\n3x = 5\nx = 5/3\n\nNow, we'll find the corresponding y-value by plugging x = 5/3 into the function:\n\nf(5/3) = |3(5/3) - 5|\nf(5/3) = |5 - 5|\nf(5/3) = 0\n\nSo, the vertex is at the point (5/3, 0).\n\n2. Determine the slope of the two line segments that form the V-shape:\n\nFor x < 5/3, the expression inside the absolute value is negative, so the function becomes:\n\nf(x) = -(3x - 5) = -3x + 5\n\nThe slope of this line segment is -3.\n\nFor x > 5/3, the expression inside the absolute value is positive, so the function remains the same:\n\nf(x) = 3x - 5\n\nThe slope of this line segment is 3.\n\n3. Graph the function:\n\nNow that we have the vertex and the slopes of the two line segments, we can graph the function. Plot the vertex at the point (5/3, 0). Then, draw a line segment with a slope of -3 to the left of the vertex and a line segment with a slope of 3 to the right of the vertex. The graph should have a V-shape, with the vertex at (5/3, 0)."
