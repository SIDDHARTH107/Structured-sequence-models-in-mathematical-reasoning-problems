    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the complex vector space $H^1(X,\\mathbb{C})$, we can use the genus-degree formula for algebraic curves. The genus-degree formula relates the genus $g$ of a smooth projective algebraic curve to the degree $d$ of the curve, and is given by:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$\n\nIn our case, the equation of the curve is $y^2 = x^3 - 3x + 1$. This is a cubic curve (degree $d = 3$), so we can apply the genus-degree formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$\n\nNow, we know that for a smooth projective algebraic curve, the dimension of the complex vector space $H^1(X,\\mathbb{C})$ is equal to the genus of the curve. Therefore, the dimension of $H^1(X,\\mathbb{C})$ is equal to the genus $g = 1$."
