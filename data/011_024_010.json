    "message_1": "A network of pipes connect water sources A and B with two factories C and D. The maximum capacity of the network is 1000 units. It costs 2 dollars to transport 1 unit of water from A to C, 5 dollars to transport 1 unit of water from A to D, 3 dollars to transport 1 unit of water from B to C and 4 dollars to transport 1 unit of water from B to D. Find the maximum amount of water that can be transported at a minimum cost.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount of water transported from A to C, y be the amount of water transported from A to D, z be the amount of water transported from B to C, and w be the amount of water transported from B to D. The total cost of transporting the water is given by the equation:\n\nCost = 2x + 5y + 3z + 4w\n\nWe want to minimize this cost while still transporting the maximum capacity of 1000 units of water. The constraints for this problem are:\n\n1. x + y + z + w = 1000 (total water transported)\n2. x, y, z, w â‰¥ 0 (non-negative amounts of water)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we want to prioritize the cheapest routes first. The cheapest route is from A to C, with a cost of 2 dollars per unit. The next cheapest route is from B to C, with a cost of 3 dollars per unit. The third cheapest route is from B to D, with a cost of 4 dollars per unit. The most expensive route is from A to D, with a cost of 5 dollars per unit.\n\nWe will first try to transport as much water as possible from A to C, then from B to C, and then from B to D. We will only use the route from A to D if necessary.\n\n1. Transporting water from A to C: x = 1000, y = 0, z = 0, w = 0\n   Cost = 2(1000) + 5(0) + 3(0) + 4(0) = 2000 dollars\n\n2. Transporting water from B to C: x = 0, y = 0, z = 1000, w = 0\n   Cost = 2(0) + 5(0) + 3(1000) + 4(0) = 3000 dollars\n\n3. Transporting water from B to D: x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, w = 1000\n   Cost = 2(0) + 5(0) + 3(0) + 4(1000) = 4000 dollars\n\nSince the cheapest route is from A to C, we will transport all 1000 units of water from A to C. The minimum cost to transport the maximum amount of water (1000 units) is 2000 dollars."
