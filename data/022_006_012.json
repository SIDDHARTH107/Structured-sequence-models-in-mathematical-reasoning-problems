    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| as z varies along the circle C, we first parameterize the circle C with radius 2 centered at 0. We can do this using the polar form of complex numbers:\n\nz = 2 * e^(iθ), where θ varies from 0 to 2π.\n\nNow, we substitute this parameterization into f(z):\n\nf(2 * e^(iθ)) = (2 * e^(iθ))^3 - 3(2 * e^(iθ))^2 + 2(2 * e^(iθ)) - 1\n= 8 * e^(3iθ) - 12 * e^(2iθ) + 4 * e^(iθ) - 1\n\nNow we want to find the maximum and minimum values of |f(2 * e^(iθ))| as θ varies from 0 to 2π.\n\nTo do this, we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle, which states that the maximum and minimum values of a complex function on a closed curve occur at the boundary of the curve.\n\nWe can rewrite f(2 * e^(iθ)) as:\n\nf(2 * e^(iθ)) = 8 * e^(3iθ) - 12 * e^(2iθ) + 4 * e^(iθ) - 1\n= 8(cos(3θ) + i * sin(3θ)) - 12(cos(2θ) + i * sin(2θ)) + 4(cos(θ) + i * sin(θ)) - 1\n\nNow, we can separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\nRe(f(2 * e^(iθ))) = 8cos(3θ) - 12cos(2θ) + 4cos(θ) - 1\nIm(f(2 * e^(iθ))) = 8sin(3θ) - 12sin(2θ) + 4sin(θ)\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum and minimum values of:\n\n|f(2 * e^(iθ))|^2 = (Re(f(2 * e^(iθ))))^2 + (Im(f(2 * e^(iθ))))^2\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum values of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to θ and set it to 0:\n\nd( |f(2 * e^(iθ))|^2 )/dθ = 0\n\nSolving this equation is quite involved and may require numerical methods. However, once we find the critical points, we can evaluate |f(2 * e^(iθ))|^2 at these points and at the endpoints (θ = 0 and θ = 2π) to find the maximum and minimum values of |f(z)| as z varies along the circle C."
