    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize the cost of producing a product by determining the optimal quantities to produce for two different components. The cost function is given by C(x, y) = 3x^2 + 2xy + 4y^2 + 6x + 8y + 20, where x is the quantity of component 1 and y is the quantity of component 2. However, there are two constraints: the total quantity produced must be 1000, and the quantity of component 1 cannot exceed 400. Use the Whale Optimization Algorithm to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the cost.",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is typically used for solving complex optimization problems. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to run iterative algorithms like WOA directly. Instead, I will provide you with a general outline of how to implement the WOA to solve this problem.\n\n1. Initialize the whale population: Generate a set of random solutions (x, y) within the feasible search space, considering the constraints x + y = 1000 and 0 <= x <= 400.\n\n2. Calculate the fitness of each solution: Compute the cost function C(x, y) for each solution and determine their fitness. In this case, the fitness can be defined as the inverse of the cost function, i.e., fitness = 1 / C(x, y).\n\n3. Determine the best solution: Identify the solution with the highest fitness value.\n\n4. Update the position of each whale: For each whale in the population, update its position using the WOA equations, which involve the best solution found so far, the current position of the whale, and random coefficients. Ensure that the updated positions still satisfy the constraints.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a predetermined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., the change in the best solution is below a certain threshold).\n\n6. Report the best solution found: After the algorithm has converged, return the values of x and y corresponding to the best solution.\n\nTo implement the WOA, you can use a programming language like Python and employ libraries such as NumPy and SciPy for numerical computations. Once you have implemented the WOA, you can run it to find the optimal values of x and y that minimize the cost function C(x, y) subject to the given constraints."
