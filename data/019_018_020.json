    "message_2": "The statement is true. If a triangle has two equal angles, then it is an isosceles triangle. Here's a proof to support the answer:\n\nProof:\n\nLet's consider a triangle ABC, where angle A and angle B are equal, i.e., ∠A = ∠B.\n\nAccording to the Angle-Side relationship theorem (also known as the Converse of the Corresponding Angles Postulate), if two angles of a triangle are congruent, then the sides opposite to those angles are congruent as well.\n\nIn our triangle ABC, since ∠A = ∠B, the sides opposite to these angles will also be congruent. That is, side AC will be congruent to side BC, i.e., AC = BC.\n\nSince two sides of the triangle are congruent (AC = BC), the triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle by definition.\n\nHence, the statement \"If a triangle has two equal angles, then it is isosceles\" is true."
