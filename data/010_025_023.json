    "message_1": "Suppose we have a topological quantum field theory on a closed 3-manifold $M$ with partition function $Z_M(q)$, where $q$ is the quantum parameter. If $M$ decomposes to $M=M_1\\#M_2$, where $\\#$ denotes the connected sum operation, and $M_2$ has non-empty boundary, prove that: \n\n$Z_M(q)=Z_{M_1}(q)Z_{M_2}(q),$ where $Z_{M_2}(q)$ is evaluated on the boundary of $M_2$.\n\nSolve this problem for $M=S^1\\times S^2$, where $S^1$ and $S^2$ are the 1-sphere and 2-sphere respectively. Additionally, let $M_2=D^2\\times S^1$ and evaluate $Z_{M_2}(q)$ on the boundary of $M_2$.",
    "message_2": "To prove that $Z_M(q) = Z_{M_1}(q)Z_{M_2}(q)$, we will first consider the connected sum operation. The connected sum operation is performed by removing a small open ball from each of the manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$, and then gluing the resulting manifolds along their boundaries. Since the partition function is a topological invariant, it should not depend on the choice of the small open balls that are removed.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $M = S^1 \\times S^2$. We can decompose $M$ into $M_1 = S^1 \\times S^2$ and $M_2 = D^2 \\times S^1$. Note that the boundary of $M_2$ is given by $\\partial M_2 = S^1 \\times S^1$. \n\nWe will now compute the partition functions for $M_1$ and $M_2$. Since $M_1$ is a closed 3-manifold, its partition function is given by $Z_{M_1}(q)$. For $M_2$, we need to evaluate the partition function on its boundary, which is $\\partial M_2 = S^1 \\times S^1$. The partition function for a torus is given by the sum over all representations of the fundamental group, which in this case is $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$Z_{M_2}(q) = \\sum_{(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}} q^{m^2 + n^2}.$$\n\nNow, we can compute the partition function for the connected sum $M = M_1 \\# M_2$. Since the partition function is a topological invariant, we have:\n\n$$Z_M(q) = Z_{M_1}(q)Z_{M_2}(q) = Z_{M_1}(q) \\sum_{(m,n) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}} q^{m^2 + n^2}.$$\n\nThis expression gives the partition function for the connected sum of $M_1 = S^1 \\times S^2$ and $M_2 = D^2 \\times S^1$ with the boundary of $M_2$ being $S^1 \\times S^1$."
