    "message_2": "To find the mass of the wire, we first need to find the length of the wire along the curve y = x^2 from -1 ≤ x ≤ 1. We can do this by calculating the arc length of the curve.\n\nThe arc length formula for a curve y = f(x) from x = a to x = b is given by:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFor the curve y = x^2, the derivative f'(x) = 2x. So, we have:\n\nL = ∫[-1, 1] √(1 + (2x)^2) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral. We can use the substitution method:\n\nLet u = 2x, then du = 2 dx, and dx = du/2.\n\nWhen x = -1, u = -2, and when x = 1, u = 2. So, the integral becomes:\n\nL = (1/2) ∫[-2, 2] √(1 + u^2) du\n\nThis is an integral of the form ∫ √(1 + u^2) du, which is a standard integral with the result arcsinh(u) + C. So, we have:\n\nL = (1/2) [arcsinh(u)] from -2 to 2\n\nL = (1/2) [arcsinh(2) - arcsinh(-2)]\n\nNow, we can find the mass of the wire by multiplying the length of the wire by the linear density:\n\nMass = Linear Density × Length\n\nMass = 3 grams/cm × L\n\nMass = 3 × (1/2) [arcsinh(2) - arcsinh(-2)]\n\nMass ≈ 3 × 1.7627\n\nMass ≈ 5.2881 grams\n\nSo, the mass of the wire is approximately 5.2881 grams."
