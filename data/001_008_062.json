    "message_2": "To graph the inequality y < 2x + 3 on the coordinate plane, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, graph the line y = 2x + 3 as a dashed line. This is because the inequality is \"less than\" and not \"less than or equal to,\" so the points on the line are not included in the solution.\n\n2. Choose a test point not on the line to determine which side of the line to shade. A common test point is the origin (0,0) if it is not on the line. In this case, the origin is not on the line, so we can use it as our test point.\n\n3. Substitute the test point's coordinates into the inequality to see if it is true or false. If it is true, shade the side of the line that includes the test point. If it is false, shade the opposite side of the line.\n\nFor our test point (0,0):\n0 < 2(0) + 3\n0 < 3\n\nThe inequality is true for the test point, so we shade the side of the line that includes the origin.\n\n4. The shaded region represents the solution to the inequality y < 2x + 3. All points in the shaded region will make the inequality true."
