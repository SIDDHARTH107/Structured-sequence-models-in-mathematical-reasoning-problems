    "message_1": "Let A be a set such that A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Find the complement of set A and then calculate the intersection of set A and its complement. Show that the intersection results in an empty set.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to know the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Let's assume that the universal set U is the set of integers from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. \n\nNow, the complement of set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. So, A' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNext, we need to find the intersection of set A and its complement A'. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no elements that are common to both A and A', since A contains the elements from 1 to 5 and A' contains the elements from 6 to 10.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is an empty set, denoted by ∅. Mathematically, we can write this as:\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThis shows that the intersection of a set and its complement is always an empty set."
