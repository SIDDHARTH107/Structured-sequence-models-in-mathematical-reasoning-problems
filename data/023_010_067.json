Calculate the amplitude spectrum and phase spectrum at the frequency (u=6,v=2). Round your answers to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the given image, we need to know the pixel values of the image. Since the image is provided as a link, we cannot extract the pixel values directly. However, I will provide the general steps to calculate the amplitude and phase spectrum at a specific frequency (u=6, v=2).\n\n1. Obtain the pixel values of the grayscale image in a matrix form.\n\n2. Apply the two-dimensional Fourier transform (2D-FT) to the matrix. The 2D-FT is defined as:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ(Σ(f(x, y) * e^(-j * 2 * π * (u * x / M + v * y / N))))\nwhere x = 0 to M-1, y = 0 to N-1, M and N are the dimensions of the image, and f(x, y) represents the pixel values at position (x, y).\n\n3. Calculate the amplitude spectrum A(u, v) and phase spectrum P(u, v) using the following formulas:\n\nA(u, v) = |F(u, v)|\nP(u, v) = atan2(imag(F(u, v)), real(F(u, v)))\n\n4. Find the amplitude and phase spectrum at the frequency (u=6, v=2) and round the answers to two decimal places.\n\nPlease note that without the actual pixel values of the image, it is not possible to provide the numerical values for the amplitude and phase spectrum at the given frequency."
