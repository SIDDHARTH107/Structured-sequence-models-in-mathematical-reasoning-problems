    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the length of the unknown leg \"b\".\n\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe are given that the hypotenuse (c) is 13 cm and one leg (a) is 5 cm. We can plug these values into the formula and solve for the length of the other leg (b):\n\n5^2 + b^2 = 13^2\n25 + b^2 = 169\n\nNow, we can subtract 25 from both sides of the equation:\n\nb^2 = 144\n\nFinally, we can take the square root of both sides to find the length of the other leg:\n\nb = âˆš144\nb = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 12 cm."
