    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA wave is described by the equation y(x,t) = 3cos(2x - 4t + pi/3). Find the wavelength, frequency, wave speed, and amplitude of the wave. Assume x and t are in meters and seconds, respectively.",
    "message_2": "The given wave equation is y(x, t) = 3cos(2x - 4t + π/3).\n\n1. Amplitude: The amplitude of the wave is the coefficient of the cosine function, which is 3 in this case.\n\n2. Wavelength: The wavelength can be found by looking at the coefficient of x in the argument of the cosine function. In this case, the coefficient is 2. The general form of the wave equation is y(x, t) = Acos(kx - ωt + φ), where k is the wave number and is equal to 2π/λ, where λ is the wavelength. So, we have:\n\n2 = 2π/λ\n\nSolving for λ, we get:\n\nλ = 2π/2 = π meters\n\n3. Frequency: The frequency can be found by looking at the coefficient of t in the argument of the cosine function. In this case, the coefficient is 4. The general form of the wave equation is y(x, t) = Acos(kx - ωt + φ), where ω is the angular frequency and is equal to 2πf, where f is the frequency. So, we have:\n\n4 = 2πf\n\nSolving for f, we get:\n\nf = 4/(2π) = 2/π Hz\n\n4. Wave speed: The wave speed can be found using the relationship v = λf, where v is the wave speed, λ is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. Using the values we found for λ and f, we get:\n\nv = π * (2/π) = 2 m/s\n\nSo, the amplitude is 3, the wavelength is π meters, the frequency is 2/π Hz, and the wave speed is 2 m/s."
