    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force of gravity when the object is lifted, we need to consider both the weight of the object and the weight of the cable.\n\nFirst, let's find the work done by the force of gravity on the object itself. The force of gravity acting on the object is its weight, which is given by:\n\nWeight = mass × acceleration due to gravity\nWeight = 50 lbs × 32 ft/s²\n\nSince the object is lifted vertically 20 feet, the work done by the force of gravity on the object is:\n\nWork_object = Weight × distance\nWork_object = (50 lbs × 32 ft/s²) × 20 ft\n\nNow, let's find the work done by the force of gravity on the cable. The cable weighs 0.5 pounds per foot, and it is also lifted 20 feet. Therefore, the total weight of the cable is:\n\nWeight_cable = (0.5 lbs/ft) × 20 ft\n\nThe work done by the force of gravity on the cable is:\n\nWork_cable = Weight_cable × distance\nWork_cable = ((0.5 lbs/ft) × 20 ft) × 20 ft\n\nFinally, the total work done by the force of gravity when the object is lifted is the sum of the work done on the object and the work done on the cable:\n\nTotal_work = Work_object + Work_cable\nTotal_work = (50 lbs × 32 ft/s² × 20 ft) + (0.5 lbs/ft × 20 ft × 20 ft)\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nTotal_work = (50 × 32 × 20) + (0.5 × 20 × 20)\nTotal_work = 32000 + 200\nTotal_work = 32200 ft-lbs\n\nSo, the work done by the force of gravity when the object is lifted is 32,200 ft-lbs."
