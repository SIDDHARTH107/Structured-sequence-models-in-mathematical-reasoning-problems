    "message_2": "To find the maximum independent set in G, we need to identify the largest set of vertices that are not connected by any edges. Let's analyze the graph:\n\nVertices 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle, so we can only choose one of them for the independent set. Similarly, vertices 4, 5, and 6 form another triangle, and vertices 6, 7, and 8 form a third triangle. \n\nOne possible maximum independent set is {1, 4, 7}. Another possible maximum independent set is {3, 5, 8}. Both of these sets have 3 vertices, and it's not possible to find a larger independent set in this graph.\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in G is 3."
