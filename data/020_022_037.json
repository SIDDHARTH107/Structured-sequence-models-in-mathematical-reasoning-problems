    "message_1": "A company produces two products, X and Y, and has 500 hours of machine time available per week. Each unit of product X requires 4 hours of machine time, produces a profit of $80, and has a demand for 50 units per week. Each unit of product Y requires 3 hours of machine time, produces a profit of $60, and has a demand for 60 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 80x + 60y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. Machine time constraint: 4x + 3y ≤ 500 (total machine time used should not exceed 500 hours)\n2. Demand constraint for product X: x ≤ 50 (cannot produce more than 50 units of product X)\n3. Demand constraint for product Y: y ≤ 60 (cannot produce more than 60 units of product Y)\n4. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (cannot produce negative units)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we will analyze the feasible region determined by the constraints and find the vertices of the feasible region. Then, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, let's find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0: (0, 0)\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and 3y = 500: (0, 500/3) ≈ (0, 166.67) (not feasible as y ≤ 60)\n3. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 60: (0, 60)\n4. Intersection of 4x + 3y = 500 and x = 50: (50, 100/3) ≈ (50, 33.33) (not feasible as y ≤ 30)\n5. Intersection of 4x + 3y = 500 and y = 60: (20, 60)\n6. Intersection of x = 50 and y = 0: (50, 0)\n7. Intersection of x = 50 and y = 60: (50, 60) (not feasible as 4x + 3y > 500)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 80x + 60y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 80(0) + 60(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 60) = 80(0) + 60(60) = $3600\n3. P(50, 0) = 80(50) + 60(0) = $4000\n4. P(20, 60) = 80(20) + 60(60) = $5200\n\nThe maximum profit is $5200, which occurs when the company produces 20 units of product X and 60 units of product Y."
