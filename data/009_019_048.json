If $X_0 = 2$ and we simulate the equation over the time interval $[0, 1]$ with a step size of $\\Delta t = 0.01$, what is the estimated value of $X_1$ using Euler's method?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the value of $X_1$ using Euler's method, we will discretize the stochastic differential equation and iterate through the time steps. The discretized version of the given SDE is:\n\n$$\\Delta X_t = 0.5X_t \\Delta t + X_t \\Delta W_t$$\n\nHere, $\\Delta X_t = X_{t+\\Delta t} - X_t$ and $\\Delta W_t$ is the increment of the Brownian motion over the time step $\\Delta t$. Since $\\Delta W_t$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $\\Delta t$, we can write $\\Delta W_t = \\sqrt{\\Delta t} Z_t$, where $Z_t$ is a standard normal random variable.\n\nNow, we will iterate through the time steps and update the value of $X_t$ using the discretized equation:\n\n1. Initialize $X_0 = 2$, $\\Delta t = 0.01$, and $t = 0$.\n2. Generate a standard normal random variable $Z_t$.\n3. Update $X_t$ using the discretized equation: $X_{t+\\Delta t} = X_t + 0.5X_t \\Delta t + X_t \\sqrt{\\Delta t} Z_t$.\n4. Update the time: $t = t + \\Delta t$.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until $t = 1$.\n\nAfter completing the iterations, the value of $X_t$ at $t=1$ will be our estimated value of $X_1$. Note that this is a random process, so the estimated value will vary each time you perform the simulation."
