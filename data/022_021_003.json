    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the given function, we'll use the linearity property of the Laplace transform and the standard Laplace transform formulas for sine and exponential functions.\n\nThe Laplace transform of a function f(t) is denoted by L{f(t)} = F(s), where s is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the function f(t) = 3sin(2t) + 2te^(-3t), we can find the Laplace transform of each term separately and then add them together.\n\n1. Laplace transform of 3sin(2t):\n\nL{3sin(2t)} = 3 * L{sin(2t)}\n\nThe standard Laplace transform formula for sin(at) is L{sin(at)} = a / (s^2 + a^2). In this case, a = 2.\n\nL{3sin(2t)} = 3 * (2 / (s^2 + 2^2)) = 6 / (s^2 + 4)\n\n2. Laplace transform of 2te^(-3t):\n\nL{2te^(-3t)} = 2 * L{te^(-3t)}\n\nThe standard Laplace transform formula for te^(at) is L{te^(at)} = -d/da [1 / (s - a)^2]. In this case, a = -3.\n\nL{2te^(-3t)} = 2 * (-d/da [1 / (s - (-3))^2]) = 2 * (-d/da [1 / (s + 3)^2])\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to a:\n\nL{2te^(-3t)} = 2 * (2 / (s + 3)^3) = 4 / (s + 3)^3\n\nNow, we can add the Laplace transforms of the two terms together:\n\nL{f(t)} = L{3sin(2t) + 2te^(-3t)} = L{3sin(2t)} + L{2te^(-3t)}\n\nL{f(t)} = (6 / (s^2 + 4)) + (4 / (s + 3)^3)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 3sin(2t) + 2te^(-3t) is:\n\nF(s) = (6 / (s^2 + 4)) + (4 / (s + 3)^3)"
