    "message_1": "How many zeros does the polynomial $P(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 + 3z - 4$ have in the complex plane? Use Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant polynomial has at least one complex root. Furthermore, it states that a polynomial of degree n has exactly n complex roots, counting multiplicities.\n\nIn this case, the polynomial P(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 + 3z - 4 is a cubic polynomial, which means it has a degree of 3. Therefore, according to the fundamental theorem of algebra, P(z) has exactly 3 complex roots in the complex plane.\n\nLiouville's theorem is not needed to solve this problem, as the fundamental theorem of algebra is sufficient to determine the number of complex roots of the polynomial."
