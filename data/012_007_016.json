We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path: S -> A -> D -> T\n   The bottleneck capacity is min(5, 5, 8) = 5.\n   Update the residual capacities:\n   S -> A: 0, A -> S: 5\n   S -> B: 7\n   A -> C: 3\n   A -> D: 0, D -> A: 5\n   B -> D: 6\n   C -> T: 5\n   D -> T: 3, T -> D: 5\n\n2. Find another augmenting path: S -> B -> D -> T\n   The bottleneck capacity is min(7, 6, 3) = 3.\n   Update the residual capacities:\n   S -> A: 0, A -> S: 5\n   S -> B: 4, B -> S: 3\n   A -> C: 3\n   A -> D: 0, D -> A: 5\n   B -> D: 3, D -> B: 3\n   C -> T: 5\n   D -> T: 0, T -> D: 8\n\n3.

The maximum flow is the sum of the flows into the sink, which is 5 (from D) + 3 (from C) = 8. So, the maximum flow that can be sent from the source to the sink is 8."
