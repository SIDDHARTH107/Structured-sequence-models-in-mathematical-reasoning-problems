    "message_1": "Suppose a market research study has shown that the probability of a consumer purchasing a product is 0.3. What is the probability that exactly 2 out of 5 consumers will purchase the product?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of exactly 2 out of 5 consumers purchasing the product, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (consumers purchasing the product) out of n trials (total consumers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (consumer purchasing the product)\n- n is the number of trials (total consumers)\n- k is the number of successes (consumers purchasing the product)\n\nIn this case, n = 5, k = 2, and p = 0.3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(5, 2) * 0.3^2 * (1-0.3)^(5-2)\nP(X = 2) = (5! / (2!(5-2)!)) * 0.3^2 * 0.7^3\n\nCalculating the combinations:\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1)) = 10\n\nNow, plugging the values back into the formula:\nP(X = 2) = 10 * 0.3^2 * 0.7^3\nP(X = 2) = 10 * 0.09 * 0.343\nP(X = 2) â‰ˆ 0.3087\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 out of 5 consumers will purchase the product is approximately 0.3087 or 30.87%."
