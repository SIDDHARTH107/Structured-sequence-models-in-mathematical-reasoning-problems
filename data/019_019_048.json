    "message_2": "Yes, there is an algorithm to determine whether a given positive integer n is prime. One such algorithm is the trial division method. Here's the algorithm:\n\n1. If n is 1 or less, it is not prime.\n2. If n is 2 or 3, it is prime.\n3. Check if n is divisible by 2. If it is, then n is not prime.\n4. For each odd integer i from 3 to the square root of n (inclusive), check if n is divisible by i. If it is, then n is not prime.\n5. If n is not divisible by any of the integers checked, then n is prime.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    return True\n```\n\nThis algorithm is not the most efficient one for large numbers, but it is simple and works for any positive integer n. There are more advanced algorithms, such as the Miller-Rabin primality test and the AKS primality test, which are more efficient for larger numbers."
