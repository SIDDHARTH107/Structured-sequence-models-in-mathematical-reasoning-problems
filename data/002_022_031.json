    "message_2": "To find the volume of the torus formed by twisting the cylindrical tube, we need to know the major radius (R) and the minor radius (r) of the torus. The major radius is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube, and the minor radius is the distance from the center of the tube to the outer edge of the tube.\n\nIn this case, the major radius (R) is the average of the outer and inner radii of the cylindrical tube, which is (10 cm + 5 cm) / 2 = 7.5 cm. The minor radius (r) is the difference between the outer and inner radii divided by 2, which is (10 cm - 5 cm) / 2 = 2.5 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a torus is given by:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nPlugging in the values for R and r, we get:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 7.5 cm * (2.5 cm)^2\nVolume ≈ 2 * (9.8696) * 7.5 * 6.25\nVolume ≈ 919.72 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the resulting torus is approximately 919.72 cubic centimeters."
