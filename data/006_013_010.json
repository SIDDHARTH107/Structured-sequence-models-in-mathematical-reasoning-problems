    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a hurricane occurring in a particular region during hurricane season, we can use the historical probability of 0.05 per year. However, we need to know the length of the hurricane season in terms of the fraction of a year. \n\nLet's assume the hurricane season lasts for 6 months, which is half a year (0.5). We can use the formula for the probability of an event occurring at least once during a given time period:\n\nP(at least one hurricane) = 1 - P(no hurricanes)\n\nThe probability of no hurricanes occurring during the hurricane season is given by:\n\nP(no hurricanes) = (1 - annual probability)^(hurricane season length / year length)\n\nFor this problem, the annual probability is 0.05, and the hurricane season length is 0.5 years.\n\nP(no hurricanes) = (1 - 0.05)^(0.5) ≈ 0.9512\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one hurricane occurring during the hurricane season:\n\nP(at least one hurricane) = 1 - P(no hurricanes) = 1 - 0.9512 ≈ 0.0488\n\nSo, the probability of a hurricane occurring in the region during the hurricane season is approximately 0.0488 or 4.88%."
