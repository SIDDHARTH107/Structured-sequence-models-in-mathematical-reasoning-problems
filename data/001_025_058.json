    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation z^2 + 6z + 13 = 0 for complex numbers z, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = 6, and c = 13. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (-6 ± √(6^2 - 4 * 1 * 13)) / 2 * 1\n\nz = (-6 ± √(36 - 52)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, we will have complex solutions. We can rewrite the square root of a negative number as the square root of the positive number times the imaginary unit i:\n\nz = (-6 ± √(-16)) / 2\n\nz = (-6 ± √(16) * i) / 2\n\nz = (-6 ± 4i) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nz = -3 ± 2i\n\nSo, the complex solutions for the equation z^2 + 6z + 13 = 0 are:\n\nz = -3 + 2i and z = -3 - 2i"
