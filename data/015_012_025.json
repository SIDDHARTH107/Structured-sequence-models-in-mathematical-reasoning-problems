    "message_2": "The Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions to the Lorenz system, which is a system of ordinary differential equations. The parameters a, b, and r are usually represented as sigma (σ), rho (ρ), and beta (β) respectively. The commonly used values for these parameters that produce the Lorenz attractor are:\n\nσ (a) = 10\nρ (r) = 28\nβ (b) = 8/3 ≈ 2.67\n\nSo, the values of the parameters a, b, and r that produce the Lorenz attractor are approximately:\n\na = 10.00\nb = 2.67\nr = 28.00"
