    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, a perfect matching is a matching that covers all the vertices of the graph.\n\nA necessary condition for a graph to have a perfect matching is that it must have an even number of vertices. In this case, the graph G has 8 vertices, which is even, so it is possible for G to have a perfect matching.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there are any other conditions that might prevent G from having a perfect matching. One such condition is given by Tutte's theorem, which states that a graph has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset U of its vertices, the number of connected components with an odd number of vertices in the subgraph induced by the vertices not in U (denoted as c_o(G-U)) is less than or equal to the size of U (i.e., c_o(G-U) â‰¤ |U|).\n\nSince we don't have specific information about the structure of the graph G, we cannot directly apply Tutte's theorem. However, we can use the fact that G has 8 vertices and 12 edges to gain some insight.\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 8 vertices is given by the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of vertices. In this case, the maximum number of edges is 8(8-1)/2 = 28. Since G has 12 edges, it is not a complete graph, which means there might be some vertices that are not connected to each other.\n\nWithout more information about the structure of the graph G, we cannot definitively determine whether or not it has a perfect matching. It is possible for a graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges to have a perfect matching, but it is not guaranteed."
