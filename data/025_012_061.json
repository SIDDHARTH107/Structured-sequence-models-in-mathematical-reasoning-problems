Plugging this into equations (1) and (2):\n\n1) 4 = 1 + A + 1\n2) 1 = -1 - A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\n1) A = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2\n2) A = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSince we have two different values for A, we need to check the discriminant for each case.\n\nThe discriminant of an elliptic curve is given by the formula:\n\nΔ = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)\n\nCase 1: A = 2, B = 1\nΔ = -16(4(2)^3 + 27(1)^2) = -16(32 + 27) = -16(59) = -944\n\nCase 2: A = 0, B = 1\nΔ = -16(4(0)^3 + 27(1)^2) = -16(27) = -432\n\nNeither of these cases has a discriminant of -23. Therefore, there is no elliptic curve with the given discriminant that passes through the given points."
