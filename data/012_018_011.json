    "message_2": "To determine the edge connectivity λ(G) of the graph G, we need to find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. \n\nFirst, let's recall Menger's theorem, which states that the edge connectivity of a graph G is equal to the minimum number of edge-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices in G.\n\nNow, let's use the following property: for any graph G with n vertices and m edges, the edge connectivity λ(G) is at most m/n. In our case, we have n = 8 vertices and m = 12 edges, so λ(G) ≤ 12/8 = 1.5.\n\nSince edge connectivity must be an integer, λ(G) can be at most 1. However, since the graph has 12 edges, it must be connected, meaning that λ(G) cannot be 0. Therefore, the edge connectivity λ(G) of the graph G is 1."
