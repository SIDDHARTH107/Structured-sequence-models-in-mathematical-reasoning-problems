    "message_1": "In a school, there are 300 students in total. Out of these, 50 students have achieved an A grade in mathematics. If one student is chosen at random, what is the probability that they have achieved an A grade in mathematics?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a student having an A grade in mathematics, we need to divide the number of students with an A grade by the total number of students.\n\nProbability = (Number of students with an A grade) / (Total number of students)\n\nProbability = 50 / 300\n\nProbability = 1 / 6\n\nSo, the probability of a randomly chosen student having an A grade in mathematics is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667 (rounded to four decimal places)."
