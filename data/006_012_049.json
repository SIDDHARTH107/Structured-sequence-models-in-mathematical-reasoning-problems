Here's a numerical problem for calculating the probability of a certain type of crime occurring in a neighborhood:\n\nIn a particular neighborhood, the probability of a burglary occurring within a week is 0.15, and the probability of a theft occurring within the same week is 0.25. Find the probability of either a burglary or a theft occurring within the week.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of either a burglary or a theft occurring within the week, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A is the event of a burglary, B is the event of a theft, and P(A ∩ B) is the probability of both events occurring.\n\nHowever, we don't have the information about the probability of both events occurring (P(A ∩ B)). If we assume that the events are independent (meaning the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other), we can calculate P(A ∩ B) as follows:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given probabilities:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = 0.15 * 0.25 = 0.0375\n\nNow we can find the probability of either event occurring:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.15 + 0.25 - 0.0375\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.3625\n\nSo, the probability of either a burglary or a theft occurring within the week is 0.3625 or 36.25%."
