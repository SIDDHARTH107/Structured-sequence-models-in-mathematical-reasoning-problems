    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant produces two types of products, X and Y. The profit from producing one unit of X is $10 and one unit of Y is $8. The plant has 200 units of raw materials that can be used to produce both X and Y. The production of one unit of X requires 3 units of raw materials and one unit of Y requires 4. However, the availability of raw materials is stochastic and fluctuates with time.  \n\nWhat is the optimal production quantity of X and Y that maximizes the expected profit, considering the stochasticity of raw materials?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the expected profit, we need to find the optimal production quantity of X and Y, considering the constraints on raw materials. Let's denote the number of units of X produced as x and the number of units of Y produced as y.\n\nThe total profit can be represented as:\n\nProfit = 10x + 8y\n\nThe constraint on raw materials can be represented as:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 200\n\nSince the availability of raw materials is stochastic, we cannot find a single optimal solution. Instead, we can use linear programming to find the optimal production quantity of X and Y under different scenarios of raw material availability.\n\nLet's consider three different scenarios:\n\n1. High availability of raw materials: In this case, the plant has enough raw materials to produce both X and Y. The constraint remains the same: 3x + 4y ≤ 200.\n\n2. Medium availability of raw materials: In this case, the plant has a limited amount of raw materials. Let's assume the constraint is now: 3x + 4y ≤ 150.\n\n3. Low availability of raw materials: In this case, the plant has very limited raw materials. Let's assume the constraint is now: 3x + 4y ≤ 100.\n\nFor each scenario, we can use linear programming to find the optimal production quantity of X and Y that maximizes the profit. The optimal solution will be different for each scenario, and the plant can adjust its production plan accordingly based on the actual availability of raw materials."
