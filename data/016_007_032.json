    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by iteratively removing cubes from the original cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nFor a Menger sponge of order 3, this process is repeated three times. The volume of the original cube is V = 27^3 = 19683 cubic centimeters.\n\nIn the first iteration, 1/3 of the volume is removed. In the second iteration, 1/3 of the remaining volume is removed, and in the third iteration, 1/3 of the remaining volume after the second iteration is removed.\n\nLet's calculate the remaining volume after each iteration:\n\n1st iteration: V1 = (2/3) * 19683 = 13122 cubic centimeters\n2nd iteration: V2 = (2/3) * 13122 = 8748 cubic centimeters\n3rd iteration: V3 = (2/3) * 8748 = 5832 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of a Menger sponge of order 3 with an original cube side length of 27cm is 5832 cubic centimeters."
