    "message_2": "The power set of a set is the set of all possible subsets, including the empty set and the set itself. The power set of the set {1, 2, 3} is:\n\nP({1, 2, 3}) = { {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3} }\n\nThere are 8 elements in the power set P({1, 2, 3}).\n\nThe original set {1, 2, 3} has 3 elements.\n\nSince 8 > 3, the power set has more elements than the original set itself."
