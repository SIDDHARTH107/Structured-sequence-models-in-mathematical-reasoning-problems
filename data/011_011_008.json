    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which are used to count the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets. The Stirling number of the second kind is denoted as S(n, k).\n\nIn this case, we have n = 10 objects and k = 3 non-empty subsets. The formula for the Stirling number of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can use this formula recursively to find S(10, 3):\n\nS(10, 3) = 3 * S(9, 3) + S(9, 2)\n\nNow we need to find S(9, 3) and S(9, 2):\n\nS(9, 3) = 3 * S(8, 3) + S(8, 2)\nS(9, 2) = 2 * S(8, 2) + S(8, 1)\n\nWe continue this process until we reach the base cases:\n\nS(n, 1) = 1 for all n\nS(n, n) = 1 for all n\n\nUsing the base cases and the formula, we can find the values for S(10, 3):\n\nS(8, 1) = 1\nS(8, 2) = 2 * S(7, 2) + S(7, 1) = 2 * 63 + 1 = 127\nS(8, 3) = 3 * S(7, 3) + S(7, 2) = 3 * 35 + 63 = 168\nS(9, 2) = 2 * S(8, 2) + S(8, 1) = 2 * 127 + 1 = 255\nS(9, 3) = 3 * S(8, 3) + S(8, 2) = 3 * 168 + 127 = 631\nS(10, 3) = 3 * S(9, 3) + S(9, 2) = 3 * 631 + 255 = 2148\n\nSo there are 2148 ways to partition a set of 10 distinct objects into three non-empty subsets."
