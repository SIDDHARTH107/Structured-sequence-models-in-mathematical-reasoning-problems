    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = (sinh 2t) / 2t using complex analysis, we will use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * f(t)) dt, where the integral is taken from 0 to ∞.\n\nIn our case, f(t) = (sinh 2t) / 2t. So, we need to find:\n\nF(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * (sinh 2t) / 2t) dt, from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we know that sinh(x) can be expressed in terms of exponentials as:\n\nsinh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / 2.\n\nSo, we can rewrite f(t) as:\n\nf(t) = ((e^(2t) - e^(-2t)) / 4t).\n\nNow, our Laplace transform becomes:\n\nF(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * ((e^(2t) - e^(-2t)) / 4t)) dt, from 0 to ∞.\n\nLet's split the integral into two parts:\n\nF(s) = (1/4) * (∫(e^(-st) * (e^(2t) / t)) dt - ∫(e^(-st) * (e^(-2t) / t)) dt), from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, let's make a substitution in both integrals. For the first integral, let u = s - 2, and for the second integral, let v = s + 2. Then, the Laplace transform becomes:\n\nF(s) = (1/4) * (∫(e^(-ut) * (e^(2t) / t)) dt - ∫(e^(-vt) * (e^(-2t) / t)) dt), from 0 to ∞.\n\nNow, we recognize that these integrals are in the form of the Laplace transform of 1/t:\n\nL{1/t} = ∫(e^(-st) / t) dt, from 0 to ∞ = 1/s.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nF(s) = (1/4) * (1/(s-2) - 1/(s+2)).\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n\nF(s) = (1/4) * ((s+2 - (s-2)) / ((s-2)(s+2))).\n\nF(s) = (1/4) * (4 / (s^2 - 4)).\n\nF(s) = 1 / (s^2 - 4).\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = (sinh 2t) / 2t is:\n\nF(s) = 1 / (s^2 - 4)."
