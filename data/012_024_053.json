    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for connected planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 7 and E = 10. We need to find the value of F to calculate the genus g.\n\nSince G is connected, we can use the fact that for any connected graph, E ≥ V - 1. In our case, 10 ≥ 7 - 1, which is true. Now, we can use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case, 10 ≤ 3(7) - 6, which simplifies to 10 ≤ 15. This inequality holds true, so it is possible that the graph is planar. If the graph is planar, then g = 0.\n\nHowever, we still need to find the value of F to confirm this. We can rearrange Euler's formula to solve for F:\n\nF = 2 - 2g + E - V\n\nIf the graph is planar (g = 0), then:\n\nF = 2 - 2(0) + 10 - 7\nF = 2 + 3\nF = 5\n\nNow, we can use the inequality for planar graphs involving faces:\n\nE ≤ 3(F - 2)\n\nIn our case, 10 ≤ 3(5 - 2), which simplifies to 10 ≤ 9. This inequality does not hold true, which means the graph is not planar.\n\nSince the graph is not planar, we need to find the smallest genus g such that the Euler's formula holds true. Let's try g = 1:\n\nF = 2 - 2(1) + 10 - 7\nF = 2 - 2 + 3\nF = 3\n\nNow, let's check the inequality for planar graphs involving faces again:\n\nE ≤ 3(F - 2)\n\nIn this case, 10 ≤ 3(3 - 2), which simplifies to 10 ≤ 3. This inequality does not hold true either.\n\nLet's try g = 2:\n\nF = 2 - 2(2) + 10 - 7\nF = 2 - 4 + 3\nF = 1\n\nNow, let's check the inequality for planar graphs involving faces again:\n\nE ≤ 3(F - 2)\n\nIn this case, 10 ≤ 3(1 - 2), which simplifies to 10 ≤ -3. This inequality does not hold true either.\n\nSince the graph is not planar and does not satisfy the inequalities for genus 1 or 2, we can conclude that the genus of the graph G is at least 3."
