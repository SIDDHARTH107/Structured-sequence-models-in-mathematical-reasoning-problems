    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to draw the graph G with the given degree sequence (3,3,2,2,1,1). Here's one possible drawing:\n\n1. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n2. Connect vertices A, B, and C to form a triangle (since they have a degree of 3).\n3. Connect vertices D and E to vertex A (since they have a degree of 2).\n4. Connect vertices F to vertex B (since it has a degree of 1).\n\nThe resulting graph will have the following connections:\n\nA - B - C (forming a triangle)\nA - D\nA - E\nB - F\n\nThis graph satisfies the given degree sequence."
