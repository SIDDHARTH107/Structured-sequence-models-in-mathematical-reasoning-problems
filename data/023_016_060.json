    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x for -pi < x < pi with a period of 2pi, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nSince f(x) is an odd function, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients. To find b_n, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (1/pi) * ∫[-pi, pi] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nFor f(x) = x, we have:\n\nb_n = (1/pi) * ∫[-pi, pi] x * sin(nx) dx\n\nNow, we integrate by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\nb_n = (1/pi) * [(-x * (1/n) * cos(nx))|(-pi, pi) - ∫[-pi, pi] - (1/n) * cos(nx) dx]\n\nb_n = (1/pi) * [(-pi * (1/n) * cos(n * pi) - (-pi * (1/n) * cos(-n * pi))) - (1/n) * ∫[-pi, pi] cos(nx) dx]\n\nThe integral of cos(nx) over [-pi, pi] is zero, so:\n\nb_n = (1/pi) * [(-pi * (1/n) * cos(n * pi) - (-pi * (1/n) * cos(-n * pi)))]\n\nb_n = (1/pi) * [(-pi * (1/n) * cos(n * pi) + pi * (1/n) * cos(n * pi))]\n\nb_n = (1/pi) * [(-1)^n * 2 * pi / n]\n\nb_n = (-1)^n * (2/n)\n\nNow we have the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(-1)^n * (2/n) * sin(nx)]\n\nTo sketch the graph of the function and its Fourier series up to the 5th harmonic, we can use the following representation:\n\nf(x) ≈ (-1)^1 * (2/1) * sin(1x) + (-1)^2 * (2/2) * sin(2x) + (-1)^3 * (2/3) * sin(3x) + (-1)^4 * (2/4) * sin(4x) + (-1)^5 * (2/5) * sin(5x)\n\nf(x) ≈ 2 * sin(x) - sin(2x) + (2/3) * sin(3x) - (1/2) * sin(4x) + (2/5) * sin(5x)\n\nComparing the graphs of f(x) = x and its Fourier series up to the 5th harmonic, we can see that the Fourier series approximates the function well within the interval [-pi, pi], with the approximation improving as more harmonics are added. However, due to the jump discontinuity at x = 0, the Fourier series will always exhibit Gibbs phenomenon, where there is an overshoot near the discontinuity."
