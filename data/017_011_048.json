    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12 with exactly one element of order 2 and exactly one element of order 3, but no element of order 4. Let a be the element of order 2 and b be the element of order 3. We will show that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6.\n\nFirst, note that since a has order 2 and b has order 3, we have a^2 = e and b^3 = e, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, consider the element ab. Since a and b have different orders, they must be distinct elements. Moreover, since G has no element of order 4, the order of ab cannot be 4. Thus, the order of ab must be a divisor of 12 that is not 1, 2, 3, or 4. The only remaining possibility is that the order of ab is 6.\n\nLet H = ⟨ab⟩ be the subgroup of G generated by ab. Since the order of ab is 6, H is a cyclic subgroup of G of order 6. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G, which is 12. Thus, the order of H is a divisor of 12, and since H has order 6, we have that |G:H| = 2, where |G:H| denotes the index of H in G.\n\nNow, consider the left cosets of H in G. Since |G:H| = 2, there are exactly two distinct left cosets of H in G, namely H itself and aH. Since a has order 2, we have a^2 = e, and thus aH = Ha. Therefore, the left cosets of H in G are the same as the right cosets of H in G.\n\nBy the definition of a normal subgroup, a subgroup N of G is normal if and only if the left cosets of N in G are the same as the right cosets of N in G. Thus, H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since H is a normal subgroup of G, G/H is a group of order |G:H| = 2. Thus, G/H is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, which has only one non-identity element. Let c be the coset representative of this non-identity element in G/H, so cH is the non-identity element of G/H.\n\nSince a has order 2, we have aH = cH, and thus ac^(-1) is an element of H. But H is generated by ab, so there exists an integer k such that ac^(-1) = (ab)^k. Then, a = (ab)^k * c, and so a is a product of elements of order 6. This implies that G is generated by elements of order 6.\n\nNow, consider the dihedral group D6. It is well-known that D6 has exactly one element of order 2, exactly one element of order 3, and is generated by elements of order 6. Thus, G and D6 have the same properties, and we can construct an isomorphism between G and D6 by mapping a to the reflection element of D6 and b to the rotation element of D6.\n\nTherefore, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6."
