    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the input signal u(t) = 2sin(3t) + 3cos(5t), we can use the linearity property of the Fourier transform, which states that the Fourier transform of a sum of functions is equal to the sum of their individual Fourier transforms.\n\nThe Fourier transform of a sine function is given by:\n\nF{sin(at)} = (1/2j) [δ(ω - a) - δ(ω + a)]\n\nAnd the Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\nF{cos(at)} = (1/2) [δ(ω - a) + δ(ω + a)]\n\nApplying these formulas to the input signal u(t):\n\nF{u(t)} = F{2sin(3t) + 3cos(5t)}\n\nF{u(t)} = 2F{sin(3t)} + 3F{cos(5t)}\n\nNow, we can substitute the Fourier transform formulas for sine and cosine:\n\nF{u(t)} = 2(1/2j) [δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3)] + 3(1/2) [δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5)]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nF{u(t)} = (1/j) [δ(ω - 3) - δ(ω + 3)] + (3/2) [δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5)]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the input signal u(t) = 2sin(3t) + 3cos(5t)."
