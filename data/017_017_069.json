    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 30. Since 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, by the Sylow theorems, there exist Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups of G. Let P_2, P_3, and P_5 denote the Sylow 2-subgroup, Sylow 3-subgroup, and Sylow 5-subgroup of G, respectively. Then, |P_2| = 2, |P_3| = 3, and |P_5| = 5.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 6 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 = 1 or 6. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal in G. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 10 and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 = 1 or 10. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal in G.\n\nCase 1: Both n_3 = 1 and n_5 = 1.\nIn this case, both P_3 and P_5 are normal in G. Since P_3 and P_5 have relatively prime orders, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P_3 ∩ P_5 = {e}, where e is the identity element. Thus, we have a group isomorphism G ≅ P_3 × P_5, which is a cyclic group of order 15, i.e., G ≅ C30.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 1 and n_5 = 6.\nIn this case, P_3 is normal in G, but P_5 is not. Let Q be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Since there are 6 Sylow 5-subgroups, we can find an element g in G such that gQg^(-1) ≠ Q. Then, the group generated by P_3, P_5, and g has order 30, and it is non-abelian because P_5 is not normal in G. Thus, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nCase 3: n_3 = 10 and n_5 = 1.\nIn this case, P_3 is not normal in G, but P_5 is normal. This case is analogous to Case 2, and G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nCase 4: n_3 = 10 and n_5 = 6.\nIn this case, neither P_3 nor P_5 is normal in G. Let R be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since P_3 and P_5 have relatively prime orders, their intersection is trivial. Thus, we have a group isomorphism G ≅ P_3 ⋊ P_5, which is the dihedral group of order 30, i.e., G ≅ D15.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30."
