    "message_1": "Let A be a set such that A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and let B and C both be complements of set A. If B ∩ C = ∅, find the sets B and C.",
    "message_2": "Since B and C are both complements of set A, they contain all the elements that are not in set A. However, it is given that B ∩ C = ∅, which means that B and C have no elements in common. This is a contradiction because if both B and C are complements of A, they should have the same elements, and their intersection should not be an empty set.\n\nTherefore, there is an error in the problem statement, and it is not possible to find sets B and C that satisfy the given conditions."
