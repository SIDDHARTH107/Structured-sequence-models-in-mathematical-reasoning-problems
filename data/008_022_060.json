    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n| 3  2  1 | 11 |\n| 2 -3  2 |  2 |\n| 1  1  1 |  6 |\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting:\n\nStep 1: Find the pivot in the first column. The pivot is the element with the largest absolute value. In this case, it's 3, so no need to swap rows.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the elements below the pivot in the first column:\n\n| 3  2  1 | 11 |\n| 0 -5  4/3 | -12/3 |\n| 0 -1/3  2/3 |  5/3 |\n\nStep 3: Find the pivot in the second column. The pivot is the element with the largest absolute value in the second column below the first row. In this case, it's -5, so we swap the second and third rows:\n\n| 3  2  1 | 11 |\n| 0 -5  4/3 | -12/3 |\n| 0 -1/3  2/3 |  5/3 |\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the elements below the pivot in the second column:\n\n| 3  2  1 | 11 |\n| 0 -5  4/3 | -12/3 |\n| 0  0  4/5 |  16/5 |\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix, so we can use back substitution to find the solution:\n\nz = (16/5) / (4/5) = 4\n\ny = (-12/3 - 4/3 * z) / -5 = (4 - 4 * 4) / -5 = 3\n\nx = (11 - 2 * y - z) / 3 = (11 - 2 * 3 - 4) / 3 = 2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 3, and z = 4.\n\nTo determine if the matrix is ill-conditioned, we need to calculate the condition number, which is the product of the matrix's norm and its inverse's norm. However, since the matrix is not ill-conditioned if the Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting method provides a unique solution, we can conclude that the matrix is not ill-conditioned."
