    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors 𝐚 and 𝐛, we can use the following formula:\n\n𝐚 × 𝐛 = <a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1>\n\nwhere 𝐚 = <a1, a2, a3> and 𝐛 = <b1, b2, b3>.\n\nGiven 𝐚 = <3, -2, 1> and 𝐛 = <2, 4, -3>, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\n𝐚 × 𝐛 = <(-2)(-3) - (1)(4), (1)(2) - (3)(-3), (3)(4) - (-2)(2)>\n\n𝐚 × 𝐛 = <6 - 4, 2 + 9, 12 + 4>\n\n𝐚 × 𝐛 = <2, 11, 16>\n\nSo, the cross product of 𝐚 and 𝐛 is <2, 11, 16>."
