    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve from the subtopic Heat Transfer and Diffusion Equations:\n\n\"Suppose that a thin copper plate has a base of 25 cm and a height of 20 cm. The left and right edges of the plate are maintained at a constant temperature of 100°C, while the top and bottom edges are kept at a constant temperature of 50°C. Assuming that the plate is well insulated on both sides, find the temperature distribution T(x,y) within the copper plate after 2 hours, if initially, the temperature at every point is 75°C.\" \n\nThe student needs to solve the heat diffusion equation for this case and determine the temperature distribution T(x,y) at the end of 2 hours.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the 2D heat diffusion equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α(∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y²)\n\nwhere T(x, y, t) is the temperature distribution, α is the thermal diffusivity of the material, and t is the time.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1. T(0, y, t) = T(25, y, t) = 100°C for 0 ≤ y ≤ 20\n2. T(x, 0, t) = T(x, 20, t) = 50°C for 0 ≤ x ≤ 25\n3. T(x, y, 0) = 75°C for 0 ≤ x ≤ 25 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 20\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let T(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation and dividing by XT, we get:\n\n(1/XT) ∂T/∂t = α(1/X ∂²X/∂x² + 1/Y ∂²Y/∂y²)\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x and y only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\n(1/T) ∂T/∂t = -λ/α\n(1/X) ∂²X/∂x² = -λ\n(1/Y) ∂²Y/∂y² = -λ\n\nSolving these ordinary differential equations with the given boundary conditions, we get the following Fourier series solution:\n\nT(x, y, t) = 50 + (100/π) Σ [(((-1)^n - 1)/(nπ)) * sin(nπx/25) * (cosh(nπy/25) + sinh(nπ(20-y)/25)) * exp(-α(nπ/25)²t)]\n\nwhere the summation is over all odd integers n.\n\nTo find the temperature distribution after 2 hours, we can plug in t = 2 hours = 7200 seconds. Note that the thermal diffusivity of copper, α, is approximately 1.11 x 10⁻⁴ m²/s. Since the dimensions are given in centimeters, we need to convert α to cm²/s, which is approximately 1.11 x 10⁻² cm²/s.\n\nT(x, y, 7200) = 50 + (100/π) Σ [(((-1)^n - 1)/(nπ)) * sin(nπx/25) * (cosh(nπy/25) + sinh(nπ(20-y)/25)) * exp(-1.11 x 10⁻²(nπ/25)² * 7200)]\n\nThe temperature distribution T(x, y) after 2 hours can be approximated by summing the first few terms of the series."
