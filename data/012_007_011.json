    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of cars that can travel from Node 1 to Node 3 per hour, we need to consider the capacities of the different routes.\n\nThere are two possible routes from Node 1 to Node 3:\n\n1. Directly from Node 1 to Node 3, with a capacity of 10 cars per hour.\n2. From Node 1 to Node 2, and then from Node 2 to Node 3. The capacity from Node 1 to Node 2 is 15 cars per hour, and the capacity from Node 2 to Node 3 is 20 cars per hour. In this case, the bottleneck is the capacity from Node 1 to Node 2, which is 15 cars per hour.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of cars that can travel through these routes simultaneously. Since the capacities of the two routes are independent, we can simply add the capacities of the two routes:\n\nMaximum number of cars from Node 1 to Node 3 = Capacity of Route 1 + Capacity of Route 2\n= 10 cars per hour (direct route) + 15 cars per hour (via Node 2)\n= 25 cars per hour\n\nSo, the maximum number of cars that can travel from Node 1 to Node 3 per hour is 25 cars."
