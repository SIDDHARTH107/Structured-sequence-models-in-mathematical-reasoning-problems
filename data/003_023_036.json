    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors a and b, we can use the following formula:\n\na × b = (a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1)\n\nwhere a1, a2, a3 are the components of vector a, and b1, b2, b3 are the components of vector b.\n\nFor the given vectors a = (2, 3, 4) and b = (1, -1, 2), we can find the cross product as follows:\n\na × b = ( (3)(2) - (4)(-1), (4)(1) - (2)(2), (2)(-1) - (3)(1) )\na × b = ( 6 + 4, 4 - 4, -2 - 3 )\na × b = ( 10, 0, -5 )\n\nSo, the cross product of a and b is (10, 0, -5)."
