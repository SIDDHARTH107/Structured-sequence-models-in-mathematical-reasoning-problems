    "message_1": "A coffee producer claims that the average caffeine content in their coffee is 120 milligrams per cup. A customer suspects that the caffeine content is actually lower. To test this hypothesis, the customer takes a random sample of 25 cups of coffee and measures the caffeine content of each cup. From this sample, the customer calculates the mean caffeine content to be 114 milligrams per cup with a standard deviation of 8 milligrams. \n\nWhat is the test statistic for this hypothesis test? Use a significance level of 0.05. \n\nNote: The hypothesis test to be conducted is a one-sample t-test with the null hypothesis that the true mean caffeine content is equal to 120 milligrams per cup.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the test statistic for a one-sample t-test, we use the formula:\n\nt = (sample mean - hypothesized mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 114 milligrams, the hypothesized mean is 120 milligrams, the sample standard deviation is 8 milligrams, and the sample size is 25 cups.\n\nt = (114 - 120) / (8 / sqrt(25))\nt = (-6) / (8 / 5)\nt = (-6) / 1.6\nt = -3.75\n\nThe test statistic for this hypothesis test is -3.75."
