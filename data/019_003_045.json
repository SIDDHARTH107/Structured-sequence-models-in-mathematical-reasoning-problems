However, I can provide you with a question that tests the student's understanding of Modal logic. \n\nQuestion: In a world where it is necessary that if A implies B, and C is inconsistent with B; is A consistent with C? Justify your answer with a proof.",
    "message_2": "Answer: Yes, A is consistent with C.\n\nProof:\n\n1. It is necessary that if A implies B (Given)\n2. C is inconsistent with B (Given)\n\nFrom (1), we have:\n\n3. □(A → B)\n\nFrom (2), we have:\n\n4. ¬(C ∧ B)\n\nNow, we want to show that A is consistent with C, which means we want to show that:\n\n5. ¬(A ∧ ¬C) or equivalently, (A → C)\n\nTo prove (5), we will use a proof by contradiction. Assume the opposite:\n\n6. A ∧ ¬C (Assumption for contradiction)\n\nFrom (6), we have:\n\n7. A\n8. ¬C\n\nFrom (3) and (7), we have:\n\n9. B (by modus ponens)\n\nNow, from (8), we have:\n\n10. ¬B (since C is inconsistent with B)\n\nBut this is a contradiction, as we have both B and ¬B. Therefore, our assumption in (6) is false, and we have:\n\n11. ¬(A ∧ ¬C) or equivalently, (A → C)\n\nThus, A is consistent with C."
