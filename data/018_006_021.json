    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set with 50 elements. If Set A contains 27 elements, what is the number of elements in the complement of Set A? Using this information, prove that the union of Set A and its complement is the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of elements in the complement of Set A, we need to subtract the number of elements in Set A from the total number of elements in the universal set U.\n\nNumber of elements in the complement of Set A = Total number of elements in U - Number of elements in Set A\n= 50 - 27\n= 23\n\nSo, the complement of Set A contains 23 elements.\n\nNow, let's prove that the union of Set A and its complement is the universal set U.\n\nLet A' be the complement of Set A. By definition, A' contains all the elements that are in U but not in A. Therefore, every element in U is either in A or in A'. \n\nWhen we take the union of Set A and its complement A', we are combining all the elements in A and all the elements in A'. Since every element in U is either in A or in A', the union of A and A' must contain all the elements in U.\n\nThus, the union of Set A and its complement A' is the universal set U. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nA âˆª A' = U"
