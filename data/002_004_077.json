    "message_1": "A rectangular garden has a length of 10 meters and a width of 5 meters. What is the perimeter of the garden?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can use the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length (L) is 10 meters and the width (W) is 5 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 2(10 + 5)\nP = 2(15)\nP = 30 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter of the garden is 30 meters."
