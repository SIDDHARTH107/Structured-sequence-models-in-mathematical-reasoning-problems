    "message_1": "A particle with mass 1kg is confined in a one-dimensional potential well with a width of 3 nanometers and depth of 10 eV. The wave function of the particle is given as:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(πx/a), for 0<x<a\nψ(x) = B e^(−kx), for x>a\n\nwhere A and B are constants and k is the wave number of the particle. Find the value of A, B and k.",
    "message_2": "To find the values of A, B, and k, we need to apply boundary conditions and normalization conditions. The boundary conditions are:\n\n1. ψ(x) is continuous at x = a, so A sin(πx/a) = B e^(-ka)\n2. The derivative of ψ(x) is continuous at x = a, so A(π/a) cos(πx/a) = -kB e^(-ka)\n\nThe normalization condition is:\n\n∫ |ψ(x)|^2 dx = 1\n\nFor the given wave functions, we have two integrals to consider:\n\n∫[0 to a] (A sin(πx/a))^2 dx + ∫[a to ∞] (B e^(-kx))^2 dx = 1\n\nNow, let's solve the boundary conditions:\n\nDivide equation 2 by equation 1:\n\n(π/a) cos(πx/a) / sin(πx/a) = -k\n\nk = - (π/a) cot(πx/a)\n\nNow, let's solve the normalization condition:\n\n∫[0 to a] (A sin(πx/a))^2 dx = (A^2 a)/2\n\n∫[a to ∞] (B e^(-kx))^2 dx = B^2/(2k)\n\n(A^2 a)/2 + B^2/(2k) = 1\n\nNow we have three equations:\n\n1. A sin(πx/a) = B e^(-ka)\n2. k = - (π/a) cot(πx/a)\n3. (A^2 a)/2 + B^2/(2k) = 1\n\nUnfortunately, these equations cannot be solved analytically for A, B, and k without additional information about the energy levels of the particle. The energy levels will determine the values of A, B, and k, and they can be found by solving the Schrödinger equation for the given potential well."
