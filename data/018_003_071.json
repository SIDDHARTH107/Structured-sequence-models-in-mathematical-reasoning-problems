    "message_2": "To find the union of sets A and B, we combine all the elements from both sets without repetition. The union of A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, we need to prove that A ∪ B is a superset of both sets A and B. A set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n1 ∈ A ∪ B (since 1 ∈ A)\n3 ∈ A ∪ B (since 3 ∈ A)\n5 ∈ A ∪ B (since 5 ∈ A)\n7 ∈ A ∪ B (since 7 ∈ A)\n\nAll elements of A are in A ∪ B, so A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n2 ∈ A ∪ B (since 2 ∈ B)\n4 ∈ A ∪ B (since 4 ∈ B)\n6 ∈ A ∪ B (since 6 ∈ B)\n8 ∈ A ∪ B (since 8 ∈ B)\n\nAll elements of B are in A ∪ B, so A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the union of A and B, A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, is a superset of both sets A and B."
