    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nv x u = ||v|| ||u|| sin(θ) n\n\nwhere ||v|| and ||u|| are the magnitudes of the vectors v and u, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both v and u.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors v and u:\n\n||v|| = √(3^2 + 6^2 + 2^2) = √(9 + 36 + 4) = √49 = 7\n||u|| = √(2^2 + 4^2 + 5^2) = √(4 + 16 + 25) = √45\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the dot product formula to do this:\n\nv • u = ||v|| ||u|| cos(θ)\n\nv • u = (3 * 2) + (6 * 4) + (2 * 5) = 6 + 24 + 10 = 40\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (v • u) / (||v|| ||u||) = 40 / (7 * √45)\n\nNow, we can find sin(θ) using the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1\nsin^2(θ) = 1 - cos^2(θ)\n\nsin(θ) = √(1 - (40 / (7 * √45))^2)\n\nNow, we need to find the unit vector n that is perpendicular to both v and u. We can use the cross product formula to find n:\n\nn = (v x u) / ||v x u||\n\nv x u = (6 * 5 - 2 * 4)i - (3 * 5 - 2 * 2)j + (3 * 4 - 6 * 2)k = (30 - 8)i - (15 - 4)j + (12 - 12)k = 22i - 11j\n\n||v x u|| = √(22^2 + (-11)^2) = √(484 + 121) = √605\n\nn = (22/√605)i - (11/√605)j\n\nFinally, we can find the cross product v x u using the formula:\n\nv x u = ||v|| ||u|| sin(θ) n = 7 * √45 * √(1 - (40 / (7 * √45))^2) * ((22/√605)i - (11/√605)j)\n\nv x u = (7 * √45 * √(1 - (40 / (7 * √45))^2) * (22/√605))i - (7 * √45 * √(1 - (40 / (7 * √45))^2) * (11/√605))j\n\nThis is the cross product of the two vectors v and u using trigonometry."
