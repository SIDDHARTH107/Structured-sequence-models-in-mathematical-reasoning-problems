    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 10 cm and radius 2 cm is initially at a uniform temperature of 100°C. One end of the rod is kept at 200°C and the other end at 0°C. Assuming that the rod has a uniform thermal conductivity of 1.5 W/(m*K), find the temperature distribution within the rod at different times, if the heat transfer coefficient on the surface of the rod is 20 W/(m²*K) and the specific heat of the rod is 900 J/(kg*K).",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution within the rod at different times, we can use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, also known as the heat equation. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α * ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is time, x is the position along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material. The thermal diffusivity can be calculated as:\n\nα = k / (ρ * c)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density of the material, and c is the specific heat capacity.\n\nFirst, we need to find the density of the material. We can do this by using the given values of the thermal conductivity (k = 1.5 W/(m*K)), the heat transfer coefficient (h = 20 W/(m²*K)), and the specific heat capacity (c = 900 J/(kg*K)). We can use the formula:\n\nh = k / L\n\nwhere L is the characteristic length of the rod (in this case, the radius). Solving for the density, we get:\n\nρ = k / (α * c)\n\nNow, we can use the heat equation to find the temperature distribution within the rod at different times. We can solve the heat equation using separation of variables and Fourier series. The general solution for the temperature distribution is given by:\n\nT(x, t) = A + B * x + ∑[C_n * e^(-α * n² * π² * t / L²) * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere A, B, and C_n are constants that depend on the boundary conditions.\n\nIn this case, the boundary conditions are:\n\nT(0, t) = 200°C\nT(L, t) = 0°C\nT(x, 0) = 100°C\n\nApplying these boundary conditions, we can find the constants A, B, and C_n:\n\nA = 100°C\nB = -100°C / L\nC_n = (400°C / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nSo, the temperature distribution within the rod at different times is given by:\n\nT(x, t) = 100 - (100 * x / L) + ∑[(400 / (n * π)) * (1 - (-1)^n) * e^(-α * n² * π² * t / L²) * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nThis equation gives the temperature distribution within the rod at any time t and position x along the rod."
