    "message_1": "In a trust game, Player A is given $100 and has to decide how much money, x, to give to Player B. Player B receives the amount x given by Player A and must decide how much money, y, to return to Player A. If Player B returns $0, Player A receives $0, but if Player B returns the full amount received, $x, Player A receives $2x. What value of y maximizes Player B's payoff for any given value of x?",
    "message_2": "To maximize Player B's payoff, we need to consider Player B's strategy for any given value of x. Player B's payoff is the difference between the amount received from Player A (x) and the amount returned to Player A (y). So, Player B's payoff is (x - y).\n\nSince Player B wants to maximize their payoff, they should choose a value of y that maximizes (x - y). The maximum value of (x - y) occurs when y is minimized, which is y = 0.\n\nTherefore, the value of y that maximizes Player B's payoff for any given value of x is y = 0. However, it's important to note that this is a purely selfish strategy for Player B, and it may not lead to the best outcome for both players in the long run, as it may discourage Player A from giving any money to Player B in future rounds of the game."
