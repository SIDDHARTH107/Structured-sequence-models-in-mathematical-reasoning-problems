    "message_1": "What is the area of a triangle whose base is 6 cm and height is 8 cm?",
    "message_2": "The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 6 cm and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (6 × 8) / 2\nArea = 48 / 2\nArea = 24 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 24 square centimeters."
