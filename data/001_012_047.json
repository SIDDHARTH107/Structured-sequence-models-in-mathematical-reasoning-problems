    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common factors in the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 4x^2 + 6x + 2\nFactor out the greatest common factor (GCF) which is 2:\n2(2x^2 + 3x + 1)\n\nDenominator: 2x^2 + 6x\nFactor out the GCF which is 2x:\n2x(x + 3)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(2(2x^2 + 3x + 1)) / (2x(x + 3))\n\nNext, we can cancel out the common factor of 2:\n\n(2x^2 + 3x + 1) / (x(x + 3))\n\nSince there are no more common factors, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n(2x^2 + 3x + 1) / (x(x + 3))"
