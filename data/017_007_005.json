    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of an element divides the order of the group (Lagrange's Theorem).\n2. A group of prime order is cyclic and generated by any non-identity element.\n3. The dihedral group D3 has order 6 and has elements of order 2 and 3.\n4. The cyclic group C6 has order 6 and is generated by an element of order 6.\n\nProof:\n\nSince the order of G is 6, which is not a prime number, G cannot be a group of prime order. Therefore, G must have non-identity elements whose orders are divisors of 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nWe know that the identity element of G has order 1. Now, let's consider the other elements of G. By Lagrange's Theorem, the possible orders of these elements are 2, 3, or 6.\n\nCase 1: There exists an element g ∈ G with order 2 or order 3.\n\nIn this case, we have already found an element with the desired property, so the proof is complete for this case.\n\nCase 2: All non-identity elements of G have order 6.\n\nIn this case, G must be a cyclic group generated by any of these elements of order 6. Thus, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of G in each case:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 2 or order 3.\n\nIf G has an element of order 2, then it has a subgroup H of order 2. Since the index of H in G is 3, which is the smallest prime divisor of the order of G, H must be a normal subgroup of G. Similarly, if G has an element of order 3, then it has a normal subgroup K of order 3. In either case, G has a non-trivial normal subgroup, which implies that G is not simple.\n\nNow, let's consider the semidirect product of H and K. Since H and K are both normal subgroups of G, their semidirect product HK is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of H and K are 2 and 3, respectively, the order of HK is 6, which is equal to the order of G. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to the semidirect product of H and K, which is the dihedral group D3.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to C6.\n\nIn this case, G is a cyclic group generated by an element of order 6. Since the order of this element is 6, it has a unique subgroup of order 3 (generated by its square) and a unique subgroup of order 2 (generated by its cube). Thus, G has elements of order 2 and 3, and it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 6, then there exists an element g ∈ G such that g has order 2 or g has order 3, and G is isomorphic to either the dihedral group D3 or the cyclic group C6, respectively."
