    "message_1": "Let G be a group of order 24. Find out which group G is isomorphic to among the following options: the cyclic group C24, the alternating group A5, or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24.",
    "message_2": "To determine which group G is isomorphic to, we will use the Sylow theorems. The order of G is 24, which can be factored as 2^3 * 3. Therefore, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1\n2. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1\n3. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4\n\nNow, let's analyze each case:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. By the Sylow theorems, these subgroups are normal in G. Since their orders are relatively prime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of these subgroups, which is the cyclic group C24.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G. In this case, G is a semi-direct product of a Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. There are two possible semi-direct products in this case, which correspond to two of the five non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. In this case, G is a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup. There are two possible semi-direct products in this case, which correspond to two more of the five non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then G has no normal Sylow subgroups. This case corresponds to the last of the five non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\nNow, let's consider the given options:\n\n- The cyclic group C24: This is possible, as shown in case 1.\n- The alternating group A5: This group has order 5! = 120, which is not equal to 24. Therefore, G cannot be isomorphic to A5.\n- One of the five non-abelian groups of order 24: This is possible, as shown in cases 2, 3, and 4.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C24 or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24."
