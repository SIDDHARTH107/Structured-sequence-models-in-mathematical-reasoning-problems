    "message_1": "A circle has a radius of 5 cm. What is the area of the sector formed by a central angle of 120 degrees?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector formed by a central angle of 120 degrees, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm and the central angle is 120 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (120 / 360) × π × 5²\n\nArea of sector = (1/3) × π × 25\n\nArea of sector = 25π/3 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the sector formed by a central angle of 120 degrees in a circle with a radius of 5 cm is 25π/3 cm²."
