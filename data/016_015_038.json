    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve that fills a unit square. The length of the curve increases with each order. The formula to calculate the length of a Hilbert curve of order n is:\n\nLength = (2^n - 1) / 2^n\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 4, we have:\n\nLength = (2^4 - 1) / 2^4\nLength = (16 - 1) / 16\nLength = 15 / 16\nLength â‰ˆ 0.9375\n\nSo, the total length of a Hilbert curve of order 4 on a unit square is approximately 0.94 (rounded to two decimal places)."
