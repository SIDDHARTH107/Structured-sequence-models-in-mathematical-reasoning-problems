    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the system of equations by dividing each equation by their greatest common divisor:\n\n1) 3x + 2y + z = 8\n2) 3x + 2y + z = 8\n3) 3x + 2y + z = 8\n\nNow, we can use Gaussian elimination:\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n2) 0x + 0y + 0z = 0\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n3) 0x + 0y + 0z = 0\n\nNow, the system of equations looks like this:\n\n1) 3x + 2y + z = 8\n2) 0x + 0y + 0z = 0\n3) 0x + 0y + 0z = 0\n\nSince equations 2 and 3 are both 0 = 0, they are true but do not provide any information about the variables x, y, and z. We are left with only one equation:\n\n3x + 2y + z = 8\n\nThis equation represents a plane in three-dimensional space, and there is no unique solution for x, y, and z. The system of equations is dependent, and there are infinitely many solutions for x, y, and z that satisfy the given equation."
