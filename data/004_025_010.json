    "message_1": "A 100 kg object is placed on a frictionless surface and is acted upon by a force of 500 N. How long does it take for the object to reach a velocity of 10 m/s? Use calculus to solve.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using calculus, we will first set up the equations for force, acceleration, velocity, and displacement. \n\nGiven:\nMass (m) = 100 kg\nForce (F) = 500 N\n\n1. Force equation: F = m * a\n2. Acceleration equation: a = dv/dt\n3. Velocity equation: v = dx/dt\n\nFirst, we need to find the acceleration (a) using the force equation:\n\nF = m * a\n500 N = 100 kg * a\na = 5 m/s²\n\nNow, we will integrate the acceleration equation to find the velocity equation:\n\na = dv/dt\n5 m/s² = dv/dt\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to time (t):\n\n∫(5 m/s²) dt = ∫(dv)\n5t + C1 = v\n\nTo find the constant of integration (C1), we need the initial condition. Since the object starts from rest, its initial velocity is 0 m/s:\n\nv(0) = 0 = 5(0) + C1\nC1 = 0\n\nSo, the velocity equation is:\n\nv(t) = 5t\n\nNow, we want to find the time (t) it takes for the object to reach a velocity of 10 m/s:\n\n10 m/s = 5t\nt = 2 s\n\nTherefore, it takes 2 seconds for the object to reach a velocity of 10 m/s."
