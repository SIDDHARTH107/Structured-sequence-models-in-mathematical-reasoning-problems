    "message_1": "A regression model was formed to study the relationship between the number of hours a student studies for a statistics test and their resulting score on the test. The model equation is given as follows:\nTest Score = 50 + 4(Hours of Study)\nIf a student studies for 8 hours, what is their predicted score on the test?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted score for a student who studies for 8 hours, we can plug the value of 8 into the equation for Hours of Study:\n\nTest Score = 50 + 4(Hours of Study)\nTest Score = 50 + 4(8)\n\nNow, we can calculate the result:\n\nTest Score = 50 + 32\nTest Score = 82\n\nSo, the predicted score for a student who studies for 8 hours is 82."
