    "message_2": "Let the length of the field be L and the width be W. Since the field is divided into two equal parts by another fence parallel to one of the sides, we can say that the total fencing used is:\n\n2L + 3W = 200\n\nWe need to find the dimensions L and W that will maximize the area A of the field. The area of the field can be expressed as:\n\nA = L * W\n\nWe can solve the fencing equation for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = (200 - 2L) / 3\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W in the area equation:\n\nA = L * ((200 - 2L) / 3)\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to L and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dL = (200 - 4L) / 3\n\nSetting dA/dL = 0:\n\n0 = (200 - 4L) / 3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3:\n\n0 = 200 - 4L\n\nSolving for L:\n\nL = 50\n\nNow, substitute L back into the equation for W:\n\nW = (200 - 2 * 50) / 3\n\nW = (200 - 100) / 3\n\nW = 100 / 3\n\nSo, the dimensions of the field that will enclose the maximum area are L = 50 meters and W = 100/3 â‰ˆ 33.33 meters."
