    "message_2": "To find the nature and order of the singularity at $z=0$ for the function $f(z) = \\frac{\\sin z}{z^3}$, we can use the Laurent series expansion of the function around $z=0$.\n\nRecall that the Laurent series expansion of $\\sin z$ around $z=0$ is given by:\n\n$\\sin z = z - \\frac{z^3}{3!} + \\frac{z^5}{5!} - \\frac{z^7}{7!} + \\cdots$\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion of $f(z) = \\frac{\\sin z}{z^3}$ by dividing the series of $\\sin z$ by $z^3$:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{\\sin z}{z^3} = \\frac{z - \\frac{z^3}{3!} + \\frac{z^5}{5!} - \\frac{z^7}{7!} + \\cdots}{z^3}$\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^2} - \\frac{1}{3!} + \\frac{z^2}{5!} - \\frac{z^4}{7!} + \\cdots$\n\nWe can see that the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ has a finite number of terms with negative powers of $z$. Specifically, there is only one term with a negative power of $z$, which is $\\frac{1}{z^2}$. This means that the function $f(z)$ has a pole at $z=0$, and the order of the pole is 2 (the highest power of $z$ in the denominator)."
