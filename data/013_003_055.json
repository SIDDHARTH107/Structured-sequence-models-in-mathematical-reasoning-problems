    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 is given a sum of money to split with Player 2. Player 2 can either accept the offer or reject it, in which case both players receive nothing. If Player 2 accepts the offer, the money is split according to the proposed offer. \n\nLet's say Player 1 is given $10 to split with Player 2. What amount should Player 1 offer to Player 2 if they want to maximize their own earnings, assuming Player 2 will accept any offer greater than $4?",
    "message_2": "If Player 2 will accept any offer greater than $4, then Player 1 should offer Player 2 exactly $4.01. This way, Player 1 maximizes their own earnings, receiving $5.99, while still offering an amount that Player 2 will accept."
