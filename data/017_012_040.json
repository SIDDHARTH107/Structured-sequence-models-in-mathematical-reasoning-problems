    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 16. By Sylow's Theorem, G has a normal subgroup H of order 8. Let x be an element of G not in H. Then, the order of x must be 2 since the order of any element in G must divide 16. Now, consider the number of elements of order 2 in G.\n\nCase 1: The number of elements of order 2 in G is even.\n\nIn this case, we know that there is at least one element of order 2 in H (since the total number of elements of order 2 in G is even, and x is one such element). Let y be an element of order 2 in H. Then, the order of xy is also 2, as (xy)^2 = x^2y^2 = e (since x and y have order 2).\n\nNow, consider the subgroup K generated by x and y. Since x and y have order 2, K is a Klein 4-group, which is abelian. Since H is normal in G, HK is a subgroup of G. Moreover, |HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K| = 8*4/2 = 16, so HK = G. Thus, G is an extension of H by K.\n\nSince H is of order 8 and is abelian, it is either isomorphic to C8 or C4 × C2. If H is isomorphic to C8, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C8 and C2, which is the dihedral group D8. If H is isomorphic to C4 × C2, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C4 × C2 and C2, which is the cyclic group C16.\n\nCase 2: The number of elements of order 2 in G is odd.\n\nIn this case, all elements of H must have order 4 or 8. Since H is of order 8 and is abelian, it is either isomorphic to C8 or C4 × C2. However, since there are no elements of order 2 in H, it must be isomorphic to C8. Let z be an element of order 8 in H.\n\nNow, consider the set {e, x, z, xz, z^2, xz^2, z^3, xz^3}. This set has 8 distinct elements, as x and z have different orders and x is not in H. Moreover, this set is closed under the operation of G, as (xz)^2 = xz^4x = xz^4, which is in the set. Thus, this set forms a subgroup of G, which we will call L.\n\nSince L has 8 elements and G has 16 elements, there must be another element w in G not in L. The order of w must be 2, as the order of any element in G must divide 16. Moreover, the order of zw must also be 2, as (zw)^2 = z^2w^2 = z^2 (since w has order 2).\n\nNow, consider the subgroup M generated by w and zw. Since w and zw have order 2, M is a Klein 4-group, which is abelian. Since H is normal in G, HM is a subgroup of G. Moreover, |HM| = |H||M|/|H ∩ M| = 8*4/2 = 16, so HM = G. Thus, G is an extension of H by M.\n\nSince H is isomorphic to C8, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of C8 and C2 × C2. This is a non-abelian group of order 16, as desired."
