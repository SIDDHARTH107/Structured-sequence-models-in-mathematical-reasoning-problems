    "message_2": "In second-order logic, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter remains the same as in first-order logic, which is the constant π (pi). \n\nSo, if the diameter of the circle is 10 units, the circumference (C) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC = π * diameter\n\nC = π * 10\n\nThe ratio of the circumference to the diameter is:\n\nC/diameter = (π * 10) / 10 = π\n\nThus, the ratio is π, which is approximately 3.14159."
