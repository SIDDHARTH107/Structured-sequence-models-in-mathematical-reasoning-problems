    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 7, we will use the power rule for differentiation, which states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx - d(4x)/dx + d(7)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 3(2x^(2-1)) - 4(1x^(1-1)) + 0\nf'(x) = 6x - 4\n\nNow, we will find the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) - 4\nf'(2) = 12 - 4\nf'(2) = 8\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 7 at x = 2 is 8."
