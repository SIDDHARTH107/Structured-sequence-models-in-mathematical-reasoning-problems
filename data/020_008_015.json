The cost of shipping 1 unit of product from each warehouse to each retail store is different due to varying distances and transportation costs. The company wants to determine the optimal shipping routes from each warehouse to each retail store that minimize the total shipping cost. Determine the optimal shipping routes and the minimum total shipping cost given the following information:\n\nWarehouse 1 to Retail Store 1: 5 units, $10 per unit\nWarehouse 1 to Retail Store 2: 8 units, $12 per unit\nWarehouse 1 to Retail Store 3: 12 units, $15 per unit\nWarehouse 1 to Retail Store 4: 14 units, $18 per unit\nWarehouse 1 to Retail Store 5: 9 units, $13 per unit\nWarehouse 2 to Retail Store 1: 7 units, $11 per unit\nWarehouse 2 to Retail Store 2: 6 units, $8 per unit\nWarehouse 2 to Retail Store 3: 9 units, $10 per unit\nWarehouse 2 to Retail Store 4: 11 units, $14 per unit\nWarehouse 2 to Retail Store 5: 8 units, $12 per unit\nWarehouse 3 to Retail Store 1: 10 units, $16 per unit\nWarehouse 3 to Retail Store 2: 12 units, $18 per unit\nWarehouse 3 to Retail Store 3: 14 units, $20 per unit\nWarehouse 3 to Retail Store 4: 16 units, $23 per unit\nWarehouse 3 to Retail Store 5: 11 units, $17 per unit\nWarehouse 4 to Retail Store 1: 8 units, $13 per unit\nWarehouse 4 to Retail Store 2: 9 units, $10 per unit\nWarehouse 4 to Retail Store 3: 11 units, $12 per unit\nWarehouse 4 to Retail Store 4: 13 units, $16 per unit\nWarehouse 4 to Retail Store 5: 10 units, $14 per unit\nWarehouse 5 to Retail Store 1: 6 units, $9 per unit\nWarehouse 5 to Retail Store 2: 7 units, $6 per unit\nWarehouse 5 to Retail Store 3: 10 units, $8 per unit\nWarehouse 5 to Retail Store 4: 12 units, $11 per unit\nWarehouse 5 to Retail Store 5: 9 units, $7 per unit\"\n\nFind the optimal shipping routes and minimum cost for this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the transportation algorithm, which is a special case of the linear programming problem. The transportation algorithm helps to find the optimal solution for minimizing the total cost of shipping products from multiple sources (warehouses) to multiple destinations (retail stores) while satisfying supply and demand constraints.\n\nFirst, let's represent the given data in a cost matrix form:\n\n```\n            Retail Store 1  Retail Store 2  Retail Store 3  Retail Store 4  Retail Store 5\nWarehouse 1        10                12                15                18                13\nWarehouse 2        11                 8                10                14                12\nWarehouse 3        16                18                20                23                17\nWarehouse 4        13                10                12                16                14\nWarehouse 5         9                 6                 8                11                 7\n```\n\nNow, let's find the optimal shipping routes and minimum cost using the transportation algorithm:\n\n1. Find the smallest cost in each row and subtract it from all the costs in that row.\n2. Find the smallest cost in each column and subtract it from all the costs in that column.\n3. Draw the minimum number of horizontal and vertical lines to cover all the zeros in the matrix.\n4. If the number of lines is equal to the number of rows or columns, an optimal solution has been found. Otherwise, go to step 5.\n5. Find the smallest uncovered number and subtract it from all uncovered numbers. Add it to the numbers at the intersection of the lines. Go back to step 3.\n\nAfter performing these steps, we get the following optimal shipping routes and minimum cost:\n\n- Warehouse 1 to Retail Store 1: 5 units\n- Warehouse 2 to Retail Store 2: 6 units\n- Warehouse 3 to Retail Store 3: 14 units\n- Warehouse 4 to Retail Store 4: 13 units\n- Warehouse 5 to Retail Store 5: 9 units\n\nMinimum total shipping cost: (5 * 10) + (6 * 8) + (14 * 20) + (13 * 16) + (9 * 7) = 50 + 48 + 280 + 208 + 63 = $649"
