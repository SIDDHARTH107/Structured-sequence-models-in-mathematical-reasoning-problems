    "message_1": "An isosceles triangle has two sides of length 8 cm and a base of length 10 cm. Determine the length of the other two sides of the triangle.",
    "message_2": "Since the problem states that the triangle is isosceles and has two sides of length 8 cm, that means the other two sides are both 8 cm long. The base is given as 10 cm. So, the triangle has sides of length 8 cm, 8 cm, and 10 cm."
