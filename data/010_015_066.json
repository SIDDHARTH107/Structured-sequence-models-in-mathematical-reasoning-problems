    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the exterior derivative $d\\omega_1$. Recall that the exterior derivative of a 1-form is given by:\n\n$$d\\omega_1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 dy) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 dy) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^2 dy) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2 dx) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2 dx) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(y^2 dx)$$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 dy) = 2x dy \\wedge dx = -2x dx \\wedge dy$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 dy) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^2 dy) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2 dx) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^2 dx) = 2y dx \\wedge dy$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(y^2 dx) = 0$$\n\nSo, the exterior derivative $d\\omega_1$ is:\n\n$$d\\omega_1 = -2x dx \\wedge dy + 2y dx \\wedge dy = (2y - 2x) dx \\wedge dy$$\n\nNow, let's determine whether $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are cohomologous. We want to find a smooth 2-form $\\alpha$ such that $d\\alpha = \\omega_1 - \\omega_2$. First, let's compute $\\omega_1 - \\omega_2$:\n\n$$\\omega_1 - \\omega_2 = (x^2 dy + y^2 dx) - (\\sin{z} dz + y dx) = x^2 dy + (y^2 - y) dx - \\sin{z} dz$$\n\nNow, we want to find a 2-form $\\alpha$ such that $d\\alpha = x^2 dy + (y^2 - y) dx - \\sin{z} dz$. However, notice that the exterior derivative of a 2-form is a 3-form, and the right-hand side of the equation is a 1-form. Therefore, it is impossible to find a 2-form $\\alpha$ that satisfies this condition.\n\nThus, $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are not cohomologous."
