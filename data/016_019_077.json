(Assume that the perimeter of each straight line segment is easily measurable and that the perimeter of the entire island is the sum of the perimeters of these segments.)",
    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the number of segments in the Koch curve increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the number of segments is 4, and the length of each segment is 5/3 cm. After the second iteration, the number of segments is 4^2 = 16, and the length of each segment is (5/3)*(1/3) = 5/9 cm. After the third iteration, the number of segments is 4^3 = 64, and the length of each segment is (5/9)*(1/3) = 5/27 cm. After the fourth iteration, the number of segments is 4^4 = 256, and the length of each segment is (5/27)*(1/3) = 5/81 cm.\n\nSince there are three sides in the equilateral triangle, the total number of segments in the Koch island after four iterations is 3 * 256 = 768. Therefore, the total perimeter of the Koch island after four iterations is 768 * (5/81) = 480 cm."
