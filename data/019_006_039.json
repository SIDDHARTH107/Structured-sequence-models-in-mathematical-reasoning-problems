    "message_1": "I apologize, but it is not possible to create a numerical problem for deontic logic as it deals with norms and permissions, rather than numerical calculations. Deontic logic is a branch of logic that deals with the logical relationships between statements about what people ought or should do, or may, must, or might not do, or about what is allowed, permitted, or forbidden. It is not a mathematical subject that can be quantified with numerical problems.",
    "message_2": "I understand that deontic logic is not a mathematical subject. If you have any mathematical problems or questions, please feel free to ask, and I will be happy to help you with those."
