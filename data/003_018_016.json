    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3 sin(x) + 2 cos(x), we need to differentiate each term with respect to x.\n\nThe derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x).\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 3 cos(x) - 2 sin(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = π/6:\n\nf'(π/6) = 3 cos(π/6) - 2 sin(π/6)\n\nRecall that cos(π/6) = √3/2 and sin(π/6) = 1/2.\n\nf'(π/6) = 3(√3/2) - 2(1/2)\n\nf'(π/6) = (3√3/2) - (2/2)\n\nf'(π/6) = (3√3/2) - 1\n\nSo, the value of the derivative at x = π/6 is (3√3/2) - 1."
