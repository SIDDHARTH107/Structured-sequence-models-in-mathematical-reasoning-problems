    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player A is given $100, and has to decide how much of it to transfer to Player B. Player B receives this amount, and can then decide how much (if any) to send back to Player A. If Player B sends back all the money they received, it is multiplied by a factor of 2 before being returned to Player A. If they decide to keep some or all of the money, it is not multiplied before being returned. For example, if Player A decides to transfer $50 to Player B, and Player B decides to send back $30, then $60 (double the amount sent back) is returned to Player A.\n\nIf Player A transfers $60 to Player B, what would Player B have to send back in order for both players to end up with the same amount of money?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the amount Player B sends back as x. Since the money sent back is multiplied by a factor of 2, Player A will receive 2x dollars back. Player A initially had $100 and transferred $60 to Player B, so Player A has $40 left. After receiving the money back from Player B, Player A will have $40 + 2x dollars.\n\nPlayer B receives $60 from Player A and sends back x dollars. So, Player B will have $60 - x dollars left.\n\nFor both players to end up with the same amount of money, we need to set the amounts equal to each other:\n\n$40 + 2x = 60 - x$\n\nNow, we'll solve for x:\n\nAdd x to both sides:\n$40 + 3x = 60$\n\nSubtract 40 from both sides:\n$3x = 20$\n\nDivide by 3:\n$x = \\dfrac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67$\n\nSo, Player B would have to send back approximately $6.67 for both players to end up with the same amount of money. However, since we're dealing with whole dollars, Player B can send back either $6 or $7. If Player B sends back $6, both players will have slightly different amounts ($52 and $54), and if Player B sends back $7, both players will also have slightly different amounts ($54 and $53). There is no whole dollar amount that Player B can send back to make both players have exactly the same amount of money."
