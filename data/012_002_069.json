    "message_1": "Suppose you have a graph G with 10 vertices such that each vertex has degree at most 3. What is the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of G, we can use the theorem that states that the chromatic number of a graph is at most one more than the maximum degree of its vertices. In this case, the maximum degree of the vertices in G is 3.\n\nSo, the chromatic number of G is at most 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nHowever, we need to check if it is possible to color the graph with fewer colors. Since the maximum degree is 3, it is possible that we can color the graph with 3 colors. To verify this, we can use Brooks' theorem, which states that for any connected graph G, the chromatic number is at most the maximum degree, except for complete graphs or odd cycles.\n\nIn this case, G cannot be a complete graph, as the maximum degree is 3 and a complete graph with 10 vertices would have a degree of 9 for each vertex. Additionally, G cannot be an odd cycle, as an odd cycle with 10 vertices is not possible.\n\nTherefore, by Brooks' theorem, we can conclude that the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of G is 3."
