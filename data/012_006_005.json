    "message_2": "This graph is both Eulerian and Hamiltonian.\n\nA graph is Eulerian if all vertices have an even degree, and it is Hamiltonian if there exists a path that visits each vertex exactly once.\n\nFirst, let's check the degrees of each vertex:\n1. Vertex 1 has degree 4 (connected to vertices 2, 3, 4, and 5).\n2. Vertex 2 has degree 3 (connected to vertices 1, 4, and 5).\n3. Vertex 3 has degree 3 (connected to vertices 1, 5, and 6).\n4. Vertex 4 has degree 3 (connected to vertices 1, 2, and 5).\n5. Vertex 5 has degree 4 (connected to vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n6. Vertex 6 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 3 and 5).\n\nAll vertices have even degrees, so the graph is Eulerian.\n\nAn Eulerian circuit is a closed path that traverses each edge exactly once. One possible Eulerian circuit is:\n\n1 - 2 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 3 - 5 - 6 - 3\n\nNow, let's check if the graph is Hamiltonian. A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. One possible Hamiltonian path is:\n\n1 - 2 - 4 - 5 - 3 - 6\n\nSo, the graph is also Hamiltonian."
