    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car, we need to find the first derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. This will give us the velocity function $v(t)$.\n\n$s(t) = 2t^2 + 3t - 1$\n\nTaking the first derivative with respect to $t$, we get:\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(2t^2 + 3t - 1) = 4t + 3$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at $t = 2$ seconds by plugging in $t = 2$ into the velocity function:\n\n$v(2) = 4(2) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11$\n\nSo, the velocity of the car at $t = 2$ seconds is $11$ meters per second.\n\nNext, we need to find the acceleration of the car. To do this, we need to find the second derivative of the position function $s(t)$ with respect to time $t$. This will give us the acceleration function $a(t)$.\n\nWe already found the first derivative (velocity function) $v(t) = 4t + 3$. Now, we'll take the derivative of $v(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(4t + 3) = 4$\n\nThe acceleration function is a constant, which means the acceleration is the same at any time. Therefore, the acceleration of the car at $t = 2$ seconds is $4$ meters per second squared."
