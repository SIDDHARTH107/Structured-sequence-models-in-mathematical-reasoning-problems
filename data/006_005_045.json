    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces 500 widgets per hour. What is the probability that the company will produce exactly 10 widgets in 2 minutes? (Assume a constant production rate)",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the production rate per minute. Since the company produces 500 widgets per hour, we can convert this to minutes:\n\n500 widgets/hour * (1 hour/60 minutes) = 500/60 widgets/minute ≈ 8.33 widgets/minute\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of producing exactly 10 widgets in 2 minutes. Since the production rate is constant, we can multiply the production rate per minute by the number of minutes:\n\n8.33 widgets/minute * 2 minutes = 16.67 widgets\n\nHowever, this is the expected number of widgets produced in 2 minutes, not the probability of producing exactly 10 widgets. Since the production rate is constant, the number of widgets produced in a given time period follows a Poisson distribution. The probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X=k) = (λ^k * e^(-λ)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (widgets produced), k is the desired number of events (10 widgets), λ is the average rate of events (16.67 widgets), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nNow, we can plug in the values to find the probability of producing exactly 10 widgets in 2 minutes:\n\nP(X=10) = (16.67^10 * e^(-16.67)) / 10!\n\nP(X=10) ≈ (42054729.9 * 5.473e-08) / 3628800\n\nP(X=10) ≈ 0.00067\n\nSo, the probability of producing exactly 10 widgets in 2 minutes is approximately 0.067% or 0.00067 in decimal form."
