    "message_1": "A company wants to maximize its profits by optimizing its production process. The production process has three inputs, labor, raw materials, and capital. The total amount available for each input is 10, 20, and 15 respectively. The profits the company earns from producing each unit of output are given by the quadratic function ùëì(ùë•)=(3ùë•<sup>2</sup> ‚àí40ùë•+75), where ùë• is the number units of output produced. Write down the quadratic programming problem for the above scenario and find the maximum profit that the company can earn.",
    "message_2": "To write down the quadratic programming problem, we need to express the objective function and the constraints. The objective function is the profit function, which is given by:\n\nf(x) = 3x^2 - 40x + 75\n\nThe constraints are the total amount available for each input: labor, raw materials, and capital. Let's denote the amount of labor, raw materials, and capital required to produce one unit of output as L, R, and C, respectively. Then, the constraints can be written as:\n\nLx ‚â§ 10\nRx ‚â§ 20\nCx ‚â§ 15\n\nThe quadratic programming problem can be written as:\n\nMaximize: f(x) = 3x^2 - 40x + 75\nSubject to: Lx ‚â§ 10, Rx ‚â§ 20, Cx ‚â§ 15\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the maximum value of the profit function f(x) subject to the constraints. First, we find the critical points of the profit function by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 40 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 40/6 = 20/3 ‚âà 6.67\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point satisfies the constraints. Assuming that the production process requires at least some amount of each input, we can write the constraints as:\n\nL(20/3) ‚â§ 10\nR(20/3) ‚â§ 20\nC(20/3) ‚â§ 15\n\nDividing each constraint by (20/3), we get:\n\nL ‚â§ 3/2\nR ‚â§ 3\nC ‚â§ 9/4\n\nAs long as there exists a production process with input requirements L, R, and C that satisfy these inequalities, the maximum profit can be achieved at x = 20/3.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum profit by plugging this value of x back into the profit function:\n\nf(20/3) = 3(20/3)^2 - 40(20/3) + 75 ‚âà 66.67\n\nTherefore, the maximum profit that the company can earn is approximately 66.67 units."
