    "message_1": "A dataset of 100 students was collected, each with four different grades (out of 100) in different subjects. Use principal component analysis to determine how many components are needed to explain at least 80% of the variation in the dataset.",
    "message_2": "To determine how many components are needed to explain at least 80% of the variation in the dataset using principal component analysis (PCA), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the dataset: Since the grades are all on the same scale (0-100), standardization is not necessary in this case.\n\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix: The covariance matrix represents the relationships between the different subjects.\n\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix: Eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each principal component, while eigenvectors represent the direction of each principal component.\n\n4. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and calculate the cumulative explained variance: This will help us determine how many components are needed to explain at least 80% of the variation in the dataset.\n\n5. Select the number of components that meet the 80% threshold.\n\nUnfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot perform calculations or analyze actual data. However, I can guide you through the process. If you have the dataset and a software like Python or R, you can easily perform PCA and determine the number of components needed to explain at least 80% of the variation in the dataset."
