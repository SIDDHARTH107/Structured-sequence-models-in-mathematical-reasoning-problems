    "message_2": "To find the distinct non-abelian groups of order 96, we will use the Sylow theorems and analyze the possible Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. \n\nFirst, let's find the possible Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups (order 32), by Sylow's third theorem, the number of such subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. \n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups (order 3), by Sylow's third theorem, the number of such subgroups, n_3, must divide 32 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 16.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup and a normal Sylow 3-subgroup. The group is a direct product of these subgroups and is abelian, so we discard this case.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, but the Sylow 3-subgroups are not normal. The group is a semi-direct product of the normal Sylow 2-subgroup and one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 32 (Z_32 and Z_16 ⨁ Z_2), and for each of them, there are two possible semi-direct products with Z_3, resulting in 4 distinct non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n3. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 16: This case is similar to the previous one, but with more Sylow 3-subgroups. However, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups does not affect the isomorphism type of the resulting group. So, we still have 4 distinct non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, but the Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal. The group is a semi-direct product of the normal Sylow 3-subgroup and one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 32 (Z_32 and Z_16 ⨁ Z_2), and for each of them, there are two possible semi-direct products with Z_3, resulting in 4 distinct non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n5. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4: In this case, neither the Sylow 2-subgroups nor the Sylow 3-subgroups are normal. The group is a semi-direct product of a Sylow 2-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 32 (Z_32 and Z_16 ⨁ Z_2), and for each of them, there are two possible semi-direct products with Z_3, resulting in 4 distinct non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n6. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 16: This case is similar to the previous one, but with more Sylow 3-subgroups. However, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups does not affect the isomorphism type of the resulting group. So, we still have 4 distinct non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 distinct non-abelian groups of order 96. The isomorphic group structures are as follows:\n\n1. (Z_32 ⋊ Z_3) × Z_3\n2. (Z_16 ⨁ Z_2) ⋊ Z_3\n3. Z_32 ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_3)\n4. (Z_16 ⨁ Z_2) ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_3)\n5. (Z_32 ⋊ Z_3) × Z_3^2\n6. (Z_16 ⨁ Z_2) ⋊ Z_3^2\n7. Z_32 ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3)\n8. (Z_16 ⨁ Z_2) ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3)\n9. (Z_32 ⋊ Z_3) × Z_3^4\n10. (Z_16 ⨁ Z_2) ⋊ Z_3^4\n11. Z_32 ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3)\n12. (Z_16 ⨁ Z_2) ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3 × Z_3)\n13. (Z_32 ⋊ Z_3) × Z_3^8\n14.
