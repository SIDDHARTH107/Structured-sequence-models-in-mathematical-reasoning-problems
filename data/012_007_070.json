    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem on finding the maximum flow in a network:\n\nConsider the following flow network with capacities on each edge and a source node `S` and a sink node `T`:\n\n```\n   S ---3---> A --4--> C\n  / |        |  /  ^  / |\n 5  2        1/   |2/  4|\n  \\ v        v/   6 \\/  |\n   B ---2---> D --3--> T\n```\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source node `S` to the sink node `T`?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in this network, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We start by initializing the flow in all edges to 0. Then, we repeatedly find an augmenting path from the source `S` to the sink `T` and update the flow along that path until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First augmenting path: S -> A -> C -> T\n   Flow along the path: min(3, 4, 4) = 3\n   Update the flow network:\n```\n   S ---0---> A --1--> C\n  / |        |  /  ^  / |\n 5  2        1/   |2/  1|\n  \\ v        v/   6 \\/  |\n   B ---2---> D --3--> T\n```\n\n2. Second augmenting path: S -> B -> D -> T\n   Flow along the path: min(5, 2, 3) = 2\n   Update the flow network:\n```\n   S ---0---> A --1--> C\n  / |        |  /  ^  / |\n 3  0        1/   |2/  1|\n  \\ v        v/   6 \\/  |\n   B ---0---> D --1--> T\n```\n\n3. Third augmenting path: S -> A -> B -> D -> C -> T\n   Flow along the path: min(3, 1, 6, 2, 1) = 1\n   Update the flow network:\n```\n   S ---1---> A --0--> C\n  / |        |  /  ^  / |\n 2  0        0/   |3/  0|\n  \\ v        v/   6 \\/  |\n   B ---1---> D --0--> T\n```\n\n4. Fourth augmenting path: S -> B -> A -> D -> C -> T\n   Flow along the path: min(2, 1, 1, 3, 0) = 0\n\nThere are no more augmenting paths with positive flow, so we have found the maximum flow.\n\nThe maximum flow from the source node `S` to the sink node `T` is the sum of the flows into the sink node `T`: 3 + 2 = 5."
