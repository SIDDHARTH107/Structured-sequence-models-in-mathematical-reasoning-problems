    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the fourth iteration, we can use the formula P = 4*(4/3)^n*L, where n is the number of iterations and L is the length of each line segment.\n\nIn this case, n = 4 (since we want to find the perimeter after the fourth iteration) and L = 10 (since the starting equilateral triangle has a side length of 10 units).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 4*(4/3)^4*10\n\nFirst, calculate (4/3)^4:\n\n(4/3)^4 = 256/81\n\nNow, multiply this by 4 and 10:\n\nP = 4 * (256/81) * 10 = 1024/81 * 10 = 10240/81\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the fourth iteration is 10240/81 units, which is approximately 126.42 units."
