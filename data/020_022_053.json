    "message_1": "A company has three factories that can produce three different products: product X, product Y, and product Z. The profit margin for each product varies depending on the factory producing it. The profit margin per unit for each product at each factory is shown in the table below:\n\n|         | Factory 1 | Factory 2 | Factory 3 |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Product X | $10       | $15       | $20       |\n| Product Y | $12       | $16       | $14       |\n| Product Z | $18       | $20       | $22       |\n\nThe company has a total of 120 units of raw materials available for production. Each factory can produce up to 50 units of products per day. How many units of each product should be produced in which factory to maximize the total profit for the company?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total profit, we should produce the products with the highest profit margin per unit in each factory. We can see that:\n\n- Factory 1 has the highest profit margin for Product Z ($18)\n- Factory 2 has the highest profit margin for Product Z ($20)\n- Factory 3 has the highest profit margin for Product Z ($22)\n\nSince each factory can produce up to 50 units of products per day, we should allocate the 120 units of raw materials as follows:\n\n1. Factory 1 produces 50 units of Product Z\n2. Factory 2 produces 50 units of Product Z\n3. Factory 3 produces 20 units of Product Z (since we only have 120 units of raw materials in total)\n\nThis allocation will result in the maximum total profit:\n\n- Factory 1: 50 units * $18 = $900\n- Factory 2: 50 units * $20 = $1000\n- Factory 3: 20 units * $22 = $440\n\nTotal profit: $900 + $1000 + $440 = $2340"
