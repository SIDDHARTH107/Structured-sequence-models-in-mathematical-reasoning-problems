    "message_1": "What is the probability of a rear-end car accident occurring on a specific road during rush hour if the road has an average of 1500 cars passing through it every hour and the average rate of rear-end car accidents during rush hour is 8 accidents per hour?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a rear-end car accident occurring on a specific road during rush hour, we can use the following formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of rear-end car accidents per hour) / (Total number of cars passing through per hour)\n\nIn this case, the number of rear-end car accidents per hour is 8, and the total number of cars passing through per hour is 1500.\n\nProbability = 8 / 1500\n\nProbability â‰ˆ 0.005333\n\nSo, the probability of a rear-end car accident occurring on this specific road during rush hour is approximately 0.005333 or 0.5333%."
