    "message_2": "Since $f(z)$ is a harmonic function, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$.\n\nGiven $u(x, y) = 3x^2 - y^2$, we can compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 6x$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -2y$.\n\nNow we need to find a function $v(x, y)$ such that its partial derivatives satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 6x$ and $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 2y$.\n\nWe can integrate the first equation with respect to $y$ to find $v(x, y)$:\n\n$v(x, y) = 6xy + g(x)$, where $g(x)$ is an arbitrary function of $x$.\n\nNow we can differentiate this expression with respect to $x$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 6y + g'(x)$.\n\nComparing this with the second Cauchy-Riemann equation, we have:\n\n$6y + g'(x) = 2y \\Rightarrow g'(x) = -4y$.\n\nIntegrating with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$g(x) = -4yx + C$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nThus, $v(x, y) = 6xy - 4yx + C = 2xy + C$.\n\nNow we can use the given condition $f(-i) = 2 + i$ to find the constant $C$. When $z = -i$, we have $x = 0$ and $y = -1$. So,\n\n$u(0, -1) + iv(0, -1) = 2 + i$.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $u$ and $v$, we get:\n\n$(-1)^2 + i(2(0)(-1) + C) = 2 + i \\Rightarrow C = 1$.\n\nTherefore, $v(x, y) = 2xy + 1$.\n\nFinally, we can find the value of $f(2 + 3i)$:\n\n$f(2, 3) = u(2, 3) + iv(2, 3) = (3(2)^2 - (3)^2) + i(2(2)(3) + 1) = (12 - 9) + i(12 + 1) = 3 + 13i$."
