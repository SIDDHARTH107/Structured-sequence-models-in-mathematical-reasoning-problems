    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 3 > 5x - 1, we need to isolate x on one side of the inequality. \n\nStep 1: Subtract 2x from both sides of the inequality.\n3 > 3x - 1\n\nStep 2: Add 1 to both sides of the inequality.\n4 > 3x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 3.\n4/3 > x\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x < 4/3.\n\nTo graph the solution set on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a number line.\n2. Mark the point 4/3 on the number line.\n3. Since the inequality is \"x < 4/3\", we want all the values of x that are less than 4/3. So, draw an open circle at the point 4/3 (an open circle indicates that the point 4/3 is not included in the solution set).\n4. Shade the region to the left of the open circle, indicating all the values of x that are less than 4/3.\n\nThe graph of the solution set on the number line will have an open circle at 4/3 and the region to the left of the open circle shaded."
