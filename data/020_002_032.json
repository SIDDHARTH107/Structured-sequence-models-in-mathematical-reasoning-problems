    "message_1": "A company manufactures two products: Product A and Product B. The profit per unit of Product A is $5 and the profit per unit of Product B is $8. The company has two assembly lines to produce the products. Product A requires 2 hours of assembly time on Line 1 and 1 hour of assembly time on Line 2. Product B requires 1 hour of assembly time on Line 1 and 3 hours of assembly time on Line 2. The company has 80 hours of assembly time available on Line 1 and 120 hours of assembly time available on Line 2. What is the maximum profit that the company can make, assuming that it produces some of each product?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the assembly time are:\n2x + y ≤ 80 (Line 1)\nx + 3y ≤ 120 (Line 2)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 5x + 8y\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by solving the constraints for y:\n\ny ≤ 80 - 2x (from Line 1 constraint)\ny ≤ (120 - x) / 3 (from Line 2 constraint)\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by setting the constraints equal to each other:\n\n1.
