    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the absolute value function f(x) = |2x - 5|, we first need to find the x-coordinate of the vertex. The vertex occurs at the point where the expression inside the absolute value is equal to zero.\n\n2x - 5 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x = 5\nx = 5/2\n\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex is 5/2. Now, we need to find the corresponding y-coordinate by plugging the x-coordinate back into the function:\n\nf(5/2) = |2(5/2) - 5|\n\nf(5/2) = |5 - 5|\n\nf(5/2) = 0\n\nSo, the y-coordinate of the vertex is 0. Therefore, the vertex of the absolute value function f(x) = |2x - 5| is (5/2, 0)."
