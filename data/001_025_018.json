    "message_2": "To solve the complex equation (2 + 3i)z - (4 - i) = 5i, we first want to isolate z on one side of the equation. \n\nStep 1: Add (4 - i) to both sides of the equation:\n(2 + 3i)z = 5i + (4 - i)\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find z. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by (2 + 3i). \n\nz = (5i + (4 - i)) / (2 + 3i)\n\nStep 3: To simplify this expression, we'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is (2 - 3i).\n\nz = [(5i + (4 - i)) * (2 - 3i)] / [(2 + 3i) * (2 - 3i)]\n\nStep 4: Distribute the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: (5i * 2) + (5i * -3i) + (4 * 2) + (4 * -3i) + (-i * 2) + (-i * -3i)\nDenominator: (2 * 2) + (2 * -3i) + (3i * 2) + (3i * -3i)\n\nStep 5: Simplify the expressions.\n\nNumerator: 10i - 15i^2 + 8 - 12i - 2i + 3i^2\nDenominator: 4 - 6i + 6i - 9i^2\n\nStep 6: Recall that i^2 = -1, and substitute -1 for i^2 in the expressions.\n\nNumerator: 10i + 15(-1) + 8 - 12i - 2i + 3(-1)\nDenominator: 4 - 6i + 6i - 9(-1)\n\nStep 7: Simplify the expressions further.\n\nNumerator: 10i - 15 + 8 - 12i - 2i - 3\nDenominator: 4 + 9\n\nStep 8: Combine like terms.\n\nNumerator: -10 + (-4i)\nDenominator: 13\n\nStep 9: Write the final answer in the form a + bi.\n\nz = (-10/13) + (-4/13)i"
