    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 30, and 45, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\nPrime factorization of the numbers:\n20 = 2^2 * 5\n30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n45 = 3^2 * 5\n\nNow, find the highest power of each prime factor in the given numbers:\n2^2, 3^2, and 5\n\nMultiply these highest powers together:\nLCM = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180\n\nSo, the least common multiple of 20, 30, and 45 is 180."
