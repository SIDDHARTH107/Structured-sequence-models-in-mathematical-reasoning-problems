Find the dimensions of each enclosure that will maximize the total enclosed area.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the dimensions of the first enclosure as x and y, and the dimensions of the second enclosure as x and z. The total fencing material used will be the sum of the perimeters of both enclosures, minus the length of the common side (x). \n\nThe total fencing material is given by:\n200 = 2x + 2y + 2z - x\n\nThe area of the first enclosure is given by:\n1000 = x * y\n\nThe area of the second enclosure is given by:\n900 = x * z\n\nNow, we can solve for y and z in terms of x using the area equations:\n\ny = 1000/x\nz = 900/x\n\nSubstitute these expressions for y and z into the fencing material equation:\n\n200 = 2x + 2(1000/x) + 2(900/x) - x\n200 = x + 2000/x + 1800/x\n\nNow, multiply both sides by x to eliminate the fractions:\n\n200x = x^2 + 2000 + 1800\nx^2 - 200x + 3800 = 0\n\nNow, we can find the dimensions x by solving the quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -200, and c = 3800:\n\nx = (200 ± √((-200)^2 - 4(1)(3800))) / 2(1)\nx = (200 ± √(40000 - 15200)) / 2\nx = (200 ± √24800) / 2\n\nThere are two possible values for x:\n\nx1 = (200 + √24800) / 2 ≈ 110\nx2 = (200 - √24800) / 2 ≈ 90\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding values for y and z:\n\ny1 = 1000 / x1 ≈ 9.09\nz1 = 900 / x1 ≈ 8.18\n\ny2 = 1000 / x2 ≈ 11.11\nz2 = 900 / x2 ≈ 10\n\nNow, we need to determine which set of dimensions maximizes the total enclosed area. The total area for each set of dimensions is:\n\nA1 = x1 * y1 + x1 * z1 ≈ 110 * 9.09 + 110 * 8.18 ≈ 1899\nA2 = x2 * y2 + x2 * z2 ≈ 90 * 11.11 + 90 * 10 ≈ 1900\n\nThe second set of dimensions (x2, y2, z2) maximizes the total enclosed area. Therefore, the dimensions of the first enclosure are approximately 90 meters by 11.11 meters, and the dimensions of the second enclosure are approximately 90 meters by 10 meters."
