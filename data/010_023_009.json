    "message_2": "To find the maximum possible distance the two cut ends can be moved apart while still being able to reconnect and form a knot, we need to consider the longest possible path on the surface of the sphere. This path is a great circle, which is a circle with the same diameter as the sphere.\n\nThe circumference of a great circle on a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159), and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn this case, the radius of the sphere is 3, so the circumference of a great circle is:\n\nC = 2 * π * 3 ≈ 18.85\n\nSince the knot is a closed curve, we can only cut and untangle a part of it, not the entire knot. Therefore, the maximum distance the two cut ends can be moved apart is half the circumference of the great circle:\n\nMaximum distance = C / 2 ≈ 18.85 / 2 ≈ 9.42\n\nSo, the maximum possible distance the two cut ends can be moved apart while still being able to reconnect and form a knot is approximately 9.42 units."
