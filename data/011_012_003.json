    "message_2": "Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we can find the number of students who like either coffee or tea, but not both, by adding the number of students who like coffee and the number of students who like tea, and then subtracting the number of students who like both.\n\nNumber of students who like either coffee or tea, but not both = (Number of students who like coffee) + (Number of students who like tea) - (Number of students who like both coffee and tea)\n\n= 60 (coffee) + 40 (tea) - 20 (both)\n\n= 100 - 20\n\n= 80\n\nSo, 80 college students like either coffee or tea, but not both."
