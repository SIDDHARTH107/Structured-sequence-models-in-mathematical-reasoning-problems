    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph G is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph G, denoted Aut(G), is the set of all automorphisms of G.\n\nTo determine the automorphism group of graph G, we need to find all possible permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relation. Let's analyze the graph:\n\n1. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2, 3, and 5.\n2. Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 4.\n3. Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1, 2, and 4.\n4. Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 2, 3, and 5.\n5. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1, 4, and 5.\n\nWe can see that vertices 1 and 4 have the same adjacency pattern, as well as vertices 2 and 3. Therefore, we can swap vertices 1 and 4, and vertices 2 and 3, while preserving the adjacency relation.\n\nThe automorphism group of graph G, Aut(G), consists of the following permutations:\n\n1. The identity permutation (1 2 3 4 5), which maps each vertex to itself.\n2. The permutation (1 3)(2 4), which swaps vertices 1 and 4, and vertices 2 and 3.\n\nThus, the automorphism group of graph G is Aut(G) = {(1 2 3 4 5), (1 3)(2 4)}."
