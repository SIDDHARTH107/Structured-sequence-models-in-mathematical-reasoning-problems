    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a certain product at a cost of $50. The demand for the product is given by the equation Q = 200 - 5P, where P is the price per unit and Q is the quantity demanded. To maximize the company's profit, what price should they sell the product at?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's profit, we need to find the price P that maximizes the profit function. The profit function is given by the equation:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue can be calculated as the product of the price per unit (P) and the quantity demanded (Q). So, the revenue function is:\n\nRevenue = P * Q\n\nWe are given the demand function Q = 200 - 5P. We can substitute this into the revenue function:\n\nRevenue = P * (200 - 5P)\n\nNow, we can express the profit function in terms of P:\n\nProfit = P * (200 - 5P) - 50 * Q\n\nSince Q = 200 - 5P, we can substitute this into the profit function:\n\nProfit = P * (200 - 5P) - 50 * (200 - 5P)\n\nNow, let's expand and simplify the profit function:\n\nProfit = 200P - 5P^2 - 10000 + 250P\n\nProfit = -5P^2 + 450P - 10000\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We do this by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to P and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = -10P + 450 = 0\n\nSolving for P:\n\n-10P + 450 = 0\n\n10P = 450\n\nP = 45\n\nSo, the price that maximizes the company's profit is $45 per unit."
