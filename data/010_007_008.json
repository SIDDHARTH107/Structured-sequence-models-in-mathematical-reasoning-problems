    "message_2": "Let p: Y → X be the covering map, and let y₀ ∈ Y be a point such that p(y₀) = x₀. We want to determine the fundamental group Π1(Y, y₀).\n\nSince X is path-connected and has a fundamental group isomorphic to ℤ₂, we know that the group has two elements, say {e, a}, where e is the identity element and a has order 2 (i.e., a * a = e).\n\nNow, consider the action of Π1(X, x₀) on the fiber p^(-1)(x₀) by deck transformations. Since Y has two sheets, the fiber p^(-1)(x₀) consists of two points, say {y₀, y₁}, where y₀ is our chosen basepoint in Y and y₁ is the other point in the fiber.\n\nThe action of the identity element e ∈ Π1(X, x₀) on the fiber is trivial, so it fixes both y₀ and y₁. The action of the other element a ∈ Π1(X, x₀) must be nontrivial, and since there are only two points in the fiber, the action of a must swap y₀ and y₁.\n\nNow, let's consider the fundamental group Π1(Y, y₀). We know that the covering map p induces a homomorphism p_*: Π1(Y, y₀) → Π1(X, x₀). Since the action of Π1(X, x₀) on the fiber is transitive, by the lifting criterion, p_* is surjective.\n\nNow, let's determine the kernel of p_*. If an element g ∈ Π1(Y, y₀) is in the kernel of p_*, then p_*(g) = e in Π1(X, x₀), which means that the action of p_*(g) on the fiber is trivial. In other words, g must fix both y₀ and y₁. However, since Y is a two-sheeted covering space, the only element in Π1(Y, y₀) that fixes both points in the fiber is the identity element. Thus, the kernel of p_* is trivial.\n\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, we have that Π1(Y, y₀) is isomorphic to Π1(X, x₀) / Ker(p_*), which in this case is just Π1(X, x₀) since the kernel is trivial. Therefore, the fundamental group of Y is also isomorphic to ℤ₂."
