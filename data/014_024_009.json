    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept a message encrypted using a Caesar cipher, and you know that the plaintext message is in English. You also know that the most commonly used letter in English is 'e'. If the letter 'k' appears the most frequently in the encrypted message, what is the key used to encrypt the message?",
    "message_2": "To find the key used to encrypt the message, we need to determine the shift between the most common letter in English, 'e', and the most frequent letter in the encrypted message, 'k'.\n\nThe position of 'e' in the alphabet is 5, and the position of 'k' is 11. The shift between these two letters is 11 - 5 = 6. Therefore, the key used to encrypt the message is 6."
