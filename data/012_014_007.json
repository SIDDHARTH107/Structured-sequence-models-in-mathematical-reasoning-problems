    "message_1": "Consider the following two graphs:\n\nGraph G: \n\n- Vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n- Edges: {(1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)}\n\nGraph H: \n\n- Vertices: {a, b, c, d}\n- Edges: {(a, b), (b, c), (b, d), (c, d)}\n\nAre G and H isomorphic? If yes, provide an isomorphism between these graphs. If no, explain why.",
    "message_2": "Yes, G and H are isomorphic. An isomorphism between these graphs can be defined as follows:\n\nf(1) = a\nf(2) = b\nf(3) = c\nf(4) = d\n\nThis mapping preserves the adjacency of vertices in both graphs. For example, in graph G, vertices 1 and 2 are adjacent, and in graph H, vertices a and b are adjacent. This holds true for all other pairs of adjacent vertices in both graphs."
