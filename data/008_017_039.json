    "message_2": "A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, the given system of linear equations does not have many zero elements, so it is not a sparse matrix. However, we can still solve the system of linear equations using other methods, such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule.\n\nLet's use Gaussian elimination to solve the system of linear equations:\n\n1. Write down the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n| 3  2  1 | 10 |\n| 2  5  3 | 23 |\n| 1  1  2 |  8 |\n```\n\n2. Perform row operations to get the matrix into row-echelon form:\n\nFirst, we'll swap Row 1 and Row 3 to get a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n```\n| 1  1  2 |  8 |\n| 2  5  3 | 23 |\n| 3  2  1 | 10 |\n```\n\nNext, we'll eliminate the 2 in Row 2, Column 1 by subtracting 2 * Row 1 from Row 2:\n\n```\n| 1  1  2 |  8 |\n| 0  3  -1 |  7 |\n| 3  2  1 | 10 |\n```\n\nNow, we'll eliminate the 3 in Row 3, Column 1 by subtracting 3 * Row 1 from Row 3:\n\n```\n| 1  1  2 |  8 |\n| 0  3  -1 |  7 |\n| 0 -1 -5 | -14 |\n```\n\n3. Perform row operations to get the matrix into reduced row-echelon form:\n\nFirst, we'll swap Row 2 and Row 3 to get a 1 in the middle of the diagonal:\n\n```\n| 1  1  2 |  8 |\n| 0 -1 -5 | -14 |\n| 0  3  -1 |  7 |\n```\n\nNext, we'll multiply Row 2 by -1 to get a positive 1 in the middle of the diagonal:\n\n```\n| 1  1  2 |  8 |\n| 0  1  5 | 14 |\n| 0  3  -1 |  7 |\n```\n\nNow, we'll eliminate the 3 in Row 3, Column 2 by subtracting 3 * Row 2 from Row 3:\n\n```\n| 1  1  2 |  8 |\n| 0  1  5 | 14 |\n| 0  0  14 | -35 |\n```\n\nFinally, we'll divide Row 3 by 14 to get a 1 in the bottom-right corner:\n\n```\n| 1  1  2 |  8 |\n| 0  1  5 | 14 |\n| 0  0  1 | -2.5 |\n```\n\n4. Back-substitute to find the solution:\n\nFrom the last row, we have z = -2.5.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y + 5z = 14, so y = 14 - 5(-2.5) = 14 + 12.5 = 26.5.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x + y + 2z = 8, so x = 8 - 26.5 - 2(-2.5) = 8 - 26.5 + 5 = -13.5.\n\nSo the solution is x = -13.5, y = 26.5, and z = -2.5."
