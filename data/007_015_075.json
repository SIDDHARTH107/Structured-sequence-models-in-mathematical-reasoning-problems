    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1,000, we can start by finding the smallest prime number p such that 2^p - 1 is greater than 1,000.\n\n1,000 < 2^p - 1\n1,001 < 2^p\np > log2(1,001)\n\nThe smallest prime number greater than log2(1,001) â‰ˆ 10 is 11. So, we can try p = 11:\n\n2^11 - 1 = 2,047\n\n2,047 is a prime number, so the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 1,000 is 2,047."
