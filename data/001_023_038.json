    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(3x) + sin(3x) = 1, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(A) + cos(A) = √2 * sin(A + π/4)\n\nIn our case, A = 3x. So, we have:\n\n√2 * sin(3x + π/4) = 1\n\nNow, divide both sides by √2:\n\nsin(3x + π/4) = 1/√2\n\nSince 1/√2 = sin(π/4), we can write the equation as:\n\nsin(3x + π/4) = sin(π/4)\n\nNow, we can use the general solution for the sine function:\n\n3x + π/4 = nπ + (-1)^n * π/4, where n is an integer.\n\nWe need to find the solutions for x in the range [0°, 360°] or [0, 2π] in radians. Let's start with n = 0:\n\n3x + π/4 = 0 + (-1)^0 * π/4\n3x = -π/4\nx = -π/12\n\nSince x is negative, it's not in the given range. Let's try n = 1:\n\n3x + π/4 = π + (-1)^1 * π/4\n3x = π - π/4\n3x = 3π/4\nx = π/4\n\nThis solution is in the range [0, 2π]. Now, let's try n = 2:\n\n3x + π/4 = 2π + (-1)^2 * π/4\n3x = 2π - π/4\n3x = 7π/4\nx = 7π/12\n\nThis solution is also in the range [0, 2π]. For n ≥ 3, the values of x will be greater than 2π, so they are not in the given range.\n\nThus, the solutions for x in the range [0°, 360°] are:\n\nx = π/4 and x = 7π/12\n\nIn degrees, these solutions are approximately:\n\nx ≈ 45° and x ≈ 105°"
