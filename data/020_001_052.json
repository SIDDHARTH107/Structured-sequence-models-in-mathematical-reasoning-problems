    "message_1": "A furniture company wants to maximize its profits by manufacturing chairs and tables. The company has a total of 40 units of wood and 20 units of labor. Each chair requires 2 units of wood and 1 unit of labor, while each table requires 4 units of wood and 3 units of labor. If the profit per chair is $20 and the profit per table is $40, how many chairs and tables should the company manufacture to maximize their profits?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables.\n\nThe constraints for wood and labor are as follows:\n\nWood: 2x + 4y ≤ 40\nLabor: x + 3y ≤ 20\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 40y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 40\nx + 3y ≤ 20\n\nDivide the first inequality by 2:\n\nx + 2y ≤ 20\n\nNow, we can find the intercepts of the constraint inequalities:\n\nFor the wood constraint (x + 2y ≤ 20):\n\nWhen x = 0:\n0 + 2y ≤ 20\ny ≤ 10\n\nWhen y = 0:\nx + 2(0) ≤ 20\nx ≤ 20\n\nFor the labor constraint (x + 3y ≤ 20):\n\nWhen x = 0:\n0 + 3y ≤ 20\ny ≤ 20/3 ≈ 6.67\n\nWhen y = 0:\nx + 3(0) ≤ 20\nx ≤ 20\n\nNow, we can plot the feasible region on a graph with x-axis representing chairs and y-axis representing tables. The feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 10), (20, 0), and (4, 4).\n\nTo maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 20x + 40y, we need to evaluate the profit function at each of the vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 20(0) + 40(0) = $0\nP(0, 10) = 20(0) + 40(10) = $400\nP(20, 0) = 20(20) + 40(0) = $400\nP(4, 4) = 20(4) + 40(4) = $80 + $160 = $240\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertices (0, 10) and (20, 0), both yielding a profit of $400. Therefore, the company should either manufacture 10 tables and no chairs or 20 chairs and no tables to maximize their profits."
