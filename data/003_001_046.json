    "message_1": "A triangle has a hypotenuse of 10 cm and one leg of 6 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In other words, a² + b² = c².\n\nIn this case, we know the length of the hypotenuse (c) is 10 cm and the length of one leg (a) is 6 cm. We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na² + b² = c²\n6² + b² = 10²\n36 + b² = 100\n\nNow, we need to solve for b²:\n\nb² = 100 - 36\nb² = 64\n\nNow, we find the square root of 64 to get the length of the other leg (b):\n\nb = √64\nb = 8\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 8 cm."
