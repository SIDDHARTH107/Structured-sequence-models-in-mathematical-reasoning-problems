    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that increases its length with each iteration. The perimeter of the Gosper curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (Length of initial segment) * (Multiplier)^n\n\nwhere n is the iteration number, and the Multiplier for the Gosper curve is 7.\n\nFor the 4th iteration, the formula would be:\n\nPerimeter = (Initial segment length) * (7^4)\n\nIf we assume the initial segment length to be 1 unit, then the perimeter of the 4th iteration of the Gosper curve would be:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (7^4) = 1 * 2401 = 2401 units"
