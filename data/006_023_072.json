    "message_1": "In a local supermarket, 70% of customers purchase apples and 45% of customers purchase both apples and bananas. If a customer is chosen at random, what is the probability that the customer will purchase bananas given that they have already purchased apples?",
    "message_2": "Let A be the event that a customer purchases apples, and B be the event that a customer purchases bananas. We are given the following probabilities:\n\nP(A) = 0.70 (70% of customers purchase apples)\nP(A ∩ B) = 0.45 (45% of customers purchase both apples and bananas)\n\nWe want to find the probability P(B|A), which is the probability that a customer purchases bananas given that they have already purchased apples. We can use the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)\n\nPlugging in the given probabilities:\n\nP(B|A) = 0.45 / 0.70\n\nP(B|A) ≈ 0.6429\n\nSo, the probability that a customer will purchase bananas given that they have already purchased apples is approximately 64.29%."
