    "message_1": "Let's say Bob wants to send a secret message to Alice using the RSA algorithm. Bob has selected two prime numbers: p=11 and q=7. His public key is (n=77,e=13) and his private key is (d=37). Bob wants to send the message \"HELLO\" to Alice. Convert the message to a number using ASCII encoding and encrypt it using RSA. What is the ciphertext that Bob sends to Alice?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the message \"HELLO\" to a number using ASCII encoding. The ASCII values for each character are:\n\nH - 72\nE - 69\nL - 76\nL - 76\nO - 79\n\nNow, we concatenate these values to form a single number: 7269767679.\n\nNext, we need to encrypt this message using Bob's public key (n=77, e=13). To do this, we compute the following:\n\nciphertext ≡ message^e (mod n)\n\nciphertext ≡ 7269767679^13 (mod 77)\n\nHowever, the message is too large to be encrypted directly using the given public key (n=77). In practice, the message would be split into smaller blocks that can be encrypted individually. For the sake of this example, let's split the message into two blocks: 7269 and 7679.\n\nNow, we encrypt each block:\n\nciphertext1 ≡ 7269^13 (mod 77)\nciphertext1 ≡ 63\n\nciphertext2 ≡ 7679^13 (mod 77)\nciphertext2 ≡ 64\n\nSo, the encrypted message that Bob sends to Alice is \"63 64\"."
