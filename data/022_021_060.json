    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of f(t) = 2te^(-3t) using complex analysis, we need to use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(from 0 to ∞) e^(-st)f(t) dt\n\nIn our case, f(t) = 2te^(-3t). So, we need to compute the following integral:\n\nF(s) = ∫(from 0 to ∞) e^(-st) * 2te^(-3t) dt\n\nFirst, let's combine the exponential terms:\n\nF(s) = 2∫(from 0 to ∞) te^(-(s+3)t) dt\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to solve this integral. Let u = t and dv = e^(-(s+3)t) dt. Then, du = dt and v = -1/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nF(s) = 2[-t/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t) | (from 0 to ∞) - ∫(from 0 to ∞) -1/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t) dt]\n\nNow, let's evaluate the first term:\n\nlim (t→∞) [-t/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t)] - [0] = 0 (since the exponential term goes to 0 faster than the linear term t grows)\n\nSo, the first term is 0. Now, let's compute the remaining integral:\n\nF(s) = 2∫(from 0 to ∞) 1/(s+3)e^(-(s+3)t) dt\n\nThis is a simple exponential integral:\n\nF(s) = 2[-1/((s+3)^2)e^(-(s+3)t) | (from 0 to ∞)]\n\nNow, let's evaluate the limits:\n\nF(s) = 2[-1/((s+3)^2)e^(-(s+3)∞) - (-1/((s+3)^2)e^(-(s+3)0))]\n\nF(s) = 2[0 - (-1/((s+3)^2))]\n\nF(s) = 2/((s+3)^2)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of f(t) = 2te^(-3t) is F(s) = 2/((s+3)^2)."
