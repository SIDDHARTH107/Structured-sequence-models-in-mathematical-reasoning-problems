    "message_2": "To find the global maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1 on the interval [0, 3], we need to first find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to 0 or is undefined. \n\nLet's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting f'(x) equal to 0:\n\n3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve for x. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -6, and c = 2:\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(3)(2))) / (2(3))\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 24)) / 6\nx = (6 ± √12) / 6\n\nSo, we have two critical points:\n\nx1 = (6 + √12) / 6\nx2 = (6 - √12) / 6\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function f(x) at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval [0, 3]:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 3(0)^2 + 2(0) + 1 = 1\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 3(3)^2 + 2(3) + 1 = 27 - 27 + 6 + 1 = 7\n\nf(x1) = ((6 + √12) / 6)^3 - 3((6 + √12) / 6)^2 + 2((6 + √12) / 6) + 1 ≈ 0.381966\nf(x2) = ((6 - √12) / 6)^3 - 3((6 - √12) / 6)^2 + 2((6 - √12) / 6) + 1 ≈ 2.618034\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the global maximum value is 7 at x = 3, and the global minimum value is approximately 0.381966 at x ≈ (6 + √12) / 6."
