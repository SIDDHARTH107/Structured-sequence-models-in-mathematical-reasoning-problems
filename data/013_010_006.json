    "message_1": "In a Cournot competition, two companies produce identical products with the same cost structure. The market demand function for the product is given by P = 100 - Q, where P is the market price and Q is the total quantity produced by both companies. Each company has a constant marginal cost of $20 per unit. \n\nWhat quantity should each company produce to maximize their profits?",
    "message_2": "In a Cournot competition, each company chooses its production quantity to maximize its profit, taking into account the production quantity of the other company. Let q1 be the quantity produced by Company 1 and q2 be the quantity produced by Company 2. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = q1 + q2.\n\nThe market price is given by the demand function: P = 100 - Q = 100 - (q1 + q2).\n\nThe revenue for Company 1 is R1 = P * q1 = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 = 100q1 - q1^2 - q1q2.\n\nThe cost for Company 1 is C1 = 20 * q1.\n\nThe profit for Company 1 is π1 = R1 - C1 = 100q1 - q1^2 - q1q2 - 20q1.\n\nTo maximize its profit, Company 1 should choose q1 such that the first-order derivative of its profit function with respect to q1 is equal to zero:\n\nd(π1)/dq1 = 100 - 2q1 - q2 - 20 = 0.\n\nNow, we do the same for Company 2:\n\nThe revenue for Company 2 is R2 = P * q2 = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q2 = 100q2 - q2^2 - q1q2.\n\nThe cost for Company 2 is C2 = 20 * q2.\n\nThe profit for Company 2 is π2 = R2 - C2 = 100q2 - q2^2 - q1q2 - 20q2.\n\nTo maximize its profit, Company 2 should choose q2 such that the first-order derivative of its profit function with respect to q2 is equal to zero:\n\nd(π2)/dq2 = 100 - 2q2 - q1 - 20 = 0.\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\n\n1) 80 - 2q1 - q2 = 0\n2) 80 - 2q2 - q1 = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nFrom equation 1: q2 = 80 - 2q1\nSubstitute this into equation 2: 80 - 2(80 - 2q1) - q1 = 0\nSimplify: 80 - 160 + 4q1 - q1 = 0\nCombine terms: 3q1 = 80\nDivide by 3: q1 = 80/3 ≈ 26.67\n\nNow substitute q1 back into the equation for q2:\nq2 = 80 - 2(26.67) ≈ 26.67\n\nSo, each company should produce approximately 26.67 units to maximize their profits in this Cournot competition."
