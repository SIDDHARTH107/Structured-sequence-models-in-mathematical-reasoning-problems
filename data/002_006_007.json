    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter\n\nGiven that the diameter of the circle is 10 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π * 10 cm\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 10 cm\n\nC ≈ 31.4159 cm\n\nThe circumference of the circle is approximately 31.4159 cm."
