    "message_2": "To design a 12-run experiment with 4 factors and 3 levels each, we can use an orthogonal array (OA) of type L12(3^4). This array allows us to estimate all main effects and two-factor interactions. The L12(3^4) array is based on the following design matrix:\n\n```\nFactor 1 | Factor 2 | Factor 3 | Factor 4\n----------------------------------------\n   1     |    1     |    1     |    1\n   1     |    1     |    2     |    2\n   1     |    1     |    3     |    3\n   1     |    2     |    1     |    2\n   1     |    2     |    2     |    3\n   1     |    2     |    3     |    1\n   1     |    3     |    1     |    3\n   1     |    3     |    2     |    1\n   1     |    3     |    3     |    2\n   2     |    1     |    1     |    3\n   2     |    1     |    2     |    1\n   2     |    1     |    3     |    2\n```\n\nNow, we want to find the number of experimental runs that involve the combination of levels 1 and 2 for factor 1 and level 3 for factor 2. We can simply look at the design matrix and count the number of rows that meet these criteria:\n\n1. Factor 1 is at level 1 or 2.\n2. Factor 2 is at level 3.\n\nFrom the design matrix, we can see that there are 3 experimental runs that meet these criteria:\n\n- Run 7: Factor 1 is at level 1, and Factor 2 is at level 3.\n- Run 8: Factor 1 is at level 1, and Factor 2 is at level 3.\n- Run 11: Factor 1 is at level 2, and Factor 2 is at level 3.\n\nSo, there are 3 experimental runs that involve the combination of levels 1 and 2 for factor 1 and level 3 for factor 2."
