The weights (in grams) are:\n\n24, 26, 23, 22, 25, 28, 27, 70, 26, 23\n\nCalculate the median weight of the product using the method of least squares regression to account for the outlier weight of 70 grams.",
    "message_2": "The method of least squares regression is not appropriate for calculating the median weight of the product, as it is a technique used for fitting a line to a set of data points to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. Instead, we will use a more suitable method to find the median weight while accounting for the outlier.\n\nFirst, let's arrange the weights in ascending order:\n\n22, 23, 23, 24, 25, 26, 26, 27, 28, 70\n\nSince there is an outlier (70 grams), we can consider removing it from the dataset to get a more accurate representation of the median weight. After removing the outlier, the dataset becomes:\n\n22, 23, 23, 24, 25, 26, 26, 27, 28\n\nNow, we can calculate the median weight. Since there are 9 data points, the median will be the middle value, which is the 5th value in the ordered dataset:\n\n22, 23, 23, 24, 25, 26, 26, 27, 28\n\nThe median weight of the product, accounting for the outlier, is 25 grams."
