    "message_1": "Consider the following partial differential equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = 7∂²u/∂x² \n\nSuppose u(x, 0) = sin(πx/2) + x \n\nFind the solution u(x,t) to this partial differential equation, given the initial condition above. Use the method of separation of variables and solve for both the homogeneous and particular solutions. What is the final solution in terms of sin and cos functions?",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we substitute this into the PDE:\n\n∂u/∂t = 7∂²u/∂x² \nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = 7∂²X(x)/∂x² T(t)\n\nNext, we separate the variables by dividing both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\n(1/T(t)) ∂T(t)/∂t = 7(1/X(x)) ∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\n(1/T(t)) ∂T(t)/∂t = -λ\n7(1/X(x)) ∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n1. (1/T(t)) ∂T(t)/∂t = -λ\n2. 7(1/X(x)) ∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ\n\nSolving the first ODE:\n\n∂T(t)/∂t = -λT(t)\nT(t) = Ce^(-λt)\n\nSolving the second ODE:\n\n7∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λX(x)\nX(x) = A*cos(√(-λ/7)x) + B*sin(√(-λ/7)x)\n\nNow, we have the general solution:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t) = (A*cos(√(-λ/7)x) + B*sin(√(-λ/7)x)) * Ce^(-λt)\n\nTo find the particular solution, we apply the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(πx/2) + x:\n\nu(x,0) = X(x)T(0) = (A*cos(√(-λ/7)x) + B*sin(√(-λ/7)x)) * C\n\nsin(πx/2) + x = (A*cos(√(-λ/7)x) + B*sin(√(-λ/7)x)) * C\n\nSince the initial condition is given in terms of sin and cos functions, we can use Fourier series to represent it:\n\nsin(πx/2) + x = Σ[(a_n*cos(nπx) + b_n*sin(nπx))]\n\nComparing the coefficients, we have:\n\na_0 = 0\na_1 = 1\nb_1 = 1\na_n = b_n = 0 for n > 1\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ[(a_n*cos(nπx) + b_n*sin(nπx)) * Ce^(-λt)]\n\nu(x,t) = cos(πx) * Ce^(-λt) + sin(πx) * Ce^(-λt)\n\nSince we have only one term in the series, the final solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = (cos(πx) + sin(πx)) * Ce^(-λt)"
