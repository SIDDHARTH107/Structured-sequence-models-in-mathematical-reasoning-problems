    "message_1": "In a chemical plant, there is a 10% chance that a worker will suffer an accident during their shift. If there are 30 workers in the plant, what is the probability that at least 3 workers will suffer an accident on the same day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (accidents) in n trials (workers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (accident) for each trial (worker)\n- n is the number of trials (workers)\n- k is the number of successes (accidents)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least 3 workers having an accident, which means we need to find the probability of 3, 4, 5, ..., up to 30 workers having an accident. To find the probability of at least 3 accidents, we can find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 accidents and subtract that from 1:\n\nP(at least 3 accidents) = 1 - P(0 accidents) - P(1 accident) - P(2 accidents)\n\nWe are given:\n- n = 30 workers\n- p = 0.10 (10% chance of an accident)\n\nNow we can calculate the probabilities for 0, 1, and 2 accidents:\n\nP(0 accidents) = C(30, 0) * (0.10)^0 * (1-0.10)^(30-0) = 1 * 1 * (0.9)^30 ≈ 0.04239\n\nP(1 accident) = C(30, 1) * (0.10)^1 * (1-0.10)^(30-1) = 30 * 0.10 * (0.9)^29 ≈ 0.14132\n\nP(2 accidents) = C(30, 2) * (0.10)^2 * (1-0.10)^(30-2) = 435 * 0.01 * (0.9)^28 ≈ 0.22794\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of at least 3 accidents:\n\nP(at least 3 accidents) = 1 - P(0 accidents) - P(1 accident) - P(2 accidents) ≈ 1 - 0.04239 - 0.14132 - 0.22794 ≈ 0.58835\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 workers will suffer an accident on the same day is approximately 58.835%."
