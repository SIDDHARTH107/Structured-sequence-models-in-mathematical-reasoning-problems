    "message_2": "To find the minimal possible volume of a cylindrical can that can hold 500 ml, we first need to find the dimensions of the can that minimize its surface area. This is because the volume of the can is fixed at 500 ml, and we want to minimize the amount of material used to make the can.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. Since we want the can to hold 500 ml, we have:\n\n$500 = \\pi r^2 h$\n\nNow, we need to find the surface area of the can. The surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula $A = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh$, where $A$ is the surface area, $r$ is the radius, and $h$ is the height.\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can use calculus. First, we need to eliminate one of the variables, either $r$ or $h$. We can do this by solving the volume equation for one of the variables and substituting it into the surface area equation. Let's solve for $h$:\n\n$h = \\frac{500}{\\pi r^2}$\n\nNow, substitute this into the surface area equation:\n\n$A = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r\\left(\\frac{500}{\\pi r^2}\\right)$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$A = 2\\pi r^2 + \\frac{1000}{r}$\n\nNow, we can find the minimum surface area by taking the derivative of $A$ with respect to $r$ and setting it equal to 0:\n\n$\\frac{dA}{dr} = 4\\pi r - \\frac{1000}{r^2} = 0$\n\nNow, solve for $r$:\n\n$4\\pi r^3 = 1000$\n\n$r^3 = \\frac{1000}{4\\pi}$\n\n$r = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{250}{\\pi}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $r$ back into the equation for $h$:\n\n$h = \\frac{500}{\\pi \\left(\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{250}{\\pi}}\\right)^2}$\n\n$h = \\frac{500}{\\frac{250}{\\pi}}$\n\n$h = 2\\pi$\n\nNow that we have the dimensions of the can, we can find its volume. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$:\n\n$V = \\pi \\left(\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{250}{\\pi}}\\right)^2 (2\\pi)$\n\n$V \\approx 523.60$ cm$^3$\n\nSo, the minimal possible volume of a cylindrical can with radius $r$ and height $h$ that can hold a volume of 500 ml is approximately 523.60 cm$^3$."
