    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to calculate the arc length and add it to the sum of the two radii.\n\nThe formula for the arc length (L) of a sector is:\n\nL = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven a radius (r) of 10 cm and a central angle (θ) of 60 degrees, we can find the arc length:\n\nL = (60/360) × 2 × 3.14159 × 10\nL = (1/6) × 62.8318\nL = 10.47198 cm\n\nNow, we add the arc length to the sum of the two radii (10 cm each) to find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\nPerimeter = 10.47198 + 2 × 10\nPerimeter = 10.47198 + 20\nPerimeter ≈ 30.47198 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is approximately 30.47 cm."
