    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the powers of its prime divisors.\n2. A group of order p^k, where p is prime and k is a positive integer, is either cyclic or a direct product of smaller groups of order p^i, where i < k.\n3. A group of order pq, where p and q are distinct primes, is either cyclic or a direct product of two cyclic groups of order p and q.\n\nNow, let's factor 60 into its prime divisors: 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5.\n\nUsing the Sylow theorems, we can determine the possible number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime divisor:\n\n- For the 2-Sylow subgroups, the number of subgroups can be 1, 3, 5, or 15.\n- For the 3-Sylow subgroups, the number of subgroups can be 1 or 4.\n- For the 5-Sylow subgroups, the number of subgroups can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. One 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroup: This case corresponds to a cyclic group of order 60, which is isomorphic to Z_60.\n\n2. Three 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroups: This case corresponds to a non-abelian group of order 60, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_5.\n\n3. Five 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroups: This case corresponds to a non-abelian group of order 60, which is isomorphic to the alternating group A_5.\n\n4. Fifteen 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroups: This case corresponds to a non-abelian group of order 60, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_30.\n\n5. One 2-Sylow, four 3-Sylow, and one 5-Sylow subgroups: This case corresponds to a non-abelian group of order 60, which is isomorphic to the direct product Z_3 ⨂ D_10.\n\n6. One 2-Sylow, one 3-Sylow, and six 5-Sylow subgroups: This case corresponds to a non-abelian group of order 60, which is isomorphic to the direct product Z_5 ⨂ D_6.\n\nIn total, there are 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 60."
