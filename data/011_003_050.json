    "message_2": "To choose 5 distinct integers from the first 10 positive integers, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items to choose from, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n\nIn this case, we have n = 10 (the first 10 positive integers) and k = 5 (we want to choose 5 distinct integers). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * (10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * 5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1))\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo there are 252 ways to choose 5 distinct integers from the first 10 positive integers."
