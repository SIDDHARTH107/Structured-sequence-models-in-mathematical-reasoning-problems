    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can inform you about the SHA-256 hash function, but I cannot compute the hash directly. However, I can guide you on how to do it.\n\nSHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It is widely used for data integrity and security purposes. To compute the SHA-256 hash of the input \"hello\", you can use various programming languages or online tools.\n\nFor example, in Python, you can use the hashlib library:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ninput_string = \"hello\"\nhash_object = hashlib.sha256(input_string.encode())\nhash_hex = hash_object.hexdigest()\n\nprint(hash_hex)\n```\n\nThis will output the SHA-256 hash of the input \"hello\"."
