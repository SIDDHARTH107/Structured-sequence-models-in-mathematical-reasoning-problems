    "message_1": "Here's a problem for the student to solve:\n\nIn a study of the heights of students in a college, a random sample of 15 students was taken. The heights (in inches) of these 15 students are as follows: \n\n{68, 66, 71, 72, 69, 67, 67, 68, 65, 70, 73, 64, 67, 68, 70}\n\nUsing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test at a significance level of 0.05, can we conclude that the median height of the students in the college is greater than 67 inches?",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the differences between the sample values and the hypothesized median (67 inches).\n2. Rank the absolute differences, ignoring the signs.\n3. Sum the ranks of the positive differences (T+).\n4. Calculate the test statistic W.\n5. Determine the critical value for the given significance level (0.05).\n6. Compare the test statistic W to the critical value and make a conclusion.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the differences\n\n{1, -1, 4, 5, 2, 0, 0, 1, -2, 3, 6, -3, 0, 1, 3}\n\nStep 2: Rank the absolute differences (ignoring 0s)\n\n{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nStep 3: Sum the ranks of the positive differences (T+)\n\nT+ = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 25\n\nStep 4: Calculate the test statistic W\n\nW = T+ - n(n+1)/4 = 25 - 15(16)/4 = 25 - 60 = -35\n\nStep 5: Determine the critical value\n\nFor a one-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and a sample size of 15, the critical value for W is -25 (you can find this value in a Wilcoxon signed-rank test table or use statistical software).\n\nStep 6: Compare the test statistic W to the critical value\n\nSince our test statistic W (-35) is less than the critical value (-25), we reject the null hypothesis that the median height is equal to 67 inches in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the median height is greater than 67 inches.\n\nConclusion: At a significance level of 0.05, we can conclude that the median height of the students in the college is greater than 67 inches."
