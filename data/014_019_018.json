    "message_1": "Okay, here's a precise numerical problem related to Cryptanalysis of Transposition Ciphers for a math student to solve:\n\nYou intercept an encrypted message that was encrypted using a transposition cipher, and you suspect that it uses a columnar transposition with a specific number of columns. The length of the encrypted message is 60 characters. \n\n- If the key for this transposition cipher is a permutation of length 10, how many possible keys do you need to try in order to find the correct key, assuming that you know the number of columns used in the transposition cipher? \n\nHint: The number of possible permutations of length n is given by n! (n factorial), which means multiplying all positive integers up to n together.",
    "message_2": "Since the key for the transposition cipher is a permutation of length 10, we need to find the number of possible permutations of length 10. As mentioned in the hint, the number of possible permutations of length n is given by n! (n factorial).\n\nSo, for a permutation of length 10, the number of possible permutations is:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n\nTherefore, you would need to try 3,628,800 possible keys to find the correct key, assuming that you know the number of columns used in the transposition cipher."
