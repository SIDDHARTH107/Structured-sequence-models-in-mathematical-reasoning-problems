    "message_2": "The dot product of two vectors u and v can be calculated using the formula:\n\nu • v = |u| * |v| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nGiven the magnitudes |u| = 8 and |v| = 6, and the angle θ = 30 degrees, we can calculate the dot product as follows:\n\nu • v = 8 * 6 * cos(30°)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n30° * (π / 180°) = (π / 6) radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the cosine of the angle:\n\ncos(π / 6) = √3 / 2\n\nFinally, we can calculate the dot product:\n\nu • v = 8 * 6 * (√3 / 2) = 48 * (√3 / 2) = 24√3\n\nSo, the dot product of u and v is 24√3."
