    "message_2": "To find the value of p, we can use Hasse's theorem, which states that for an elliptic curve over a finite field F_p, the number of points N on the curve satisfies the inequality:\n\n|N - (p + 1)| ≤ 2√p\n\nGiven that the number of points on the elliptic curve is 11, we have:\n\n|11 - (p + 1)| ≤ 2√p\n\nNow, we need to find a prime number p that satisfies this inequality. We can start by testing small prime numbers.\n\nFor p = 2:\n|11 - (2 + 1)| = 8, and 2√2 ≈ 2.83. The inequality is not satisfied.\n\nFor p = 3:\n|11 - (3 + 1)| = 7, and 2√3 ≈ 3.46. The inequality is not satisfied.\n\nFor p = 5:\n|11 - (5 + 1)| = 5, and 2√5 ≈ 4.47. The inequality is satisfied.\n\nThus, the value of p is 5. The elliptic curve is defined over the finite field F_5, and the prime number p is 5."
