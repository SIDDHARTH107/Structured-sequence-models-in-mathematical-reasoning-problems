    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2), we know that G is a p-group. Let's consider the cases for the possible structures of G.\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic\nIf G is cyclic, then it is generated by a single element, say g, and G = {e, g, g^2, ..., g^8}, where e is the identity element. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_9, and we are done.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic\nIf G is not cyclic, then no single element can generate the entire group. Let's consider the elements in G and their orders. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Since the order of G is 9, the possible orders for elements in G are 1, 3, and 9. The only element with order 1 is the identity element, e. Since G is not cyclic, there is no element with order 9. Therefore, all non-identity elements in G must have order 3.\n\nLet g be an element in G with order 3, so G contains the subgroup H = {e, g, g^2}. Since the order of H is 3, which is prime, H is a normal subgroup of G. Now, consider the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 9/3 = 3, which is a prime number. Thus, G/H is cyclic, and there exists an element xH in G/H such that G/H = {eH, xH, (xH)^2}.\n\nLet x be an element in G such that xH = xH. Then, we have G = {e, x, x^2}H = {e, x, x^2, g, xg, x^2g, g^2, xg^2, x^2g^2}. We can see that G is the direct product of the cyclic groups generated by x and g, i.e., G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 9, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3."
