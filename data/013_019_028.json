The payoff matrix for the game is as follows:\n\n|    | Player 2 chooses C | Player 2 chooses D |\n|----|--------------------|--------------------|\n| **Player 1 chooses C** | (5, 5)               | (0, 6)               |\n| **Player 1 chooses D** | (6, 0)               | (2, 2)               |\n\nBefore making their choices, the players are allowed to engage in cheap talk by exchanging messages, but they cannot make any credible commitments or threats.\n\nSuppose Player 1 sends a message to Player 2 saying \"I will choose C if you choose C, otherwise I will choose D.\" What should Player 2 do to maximize their expected payoff in response to this message?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best response for Player 2, we need to consider the possible actions of Player 1 and the payoffs for Player 2 in each case. Since the message is cheap talk and there are no credible commitments or threats, Player 1 could still choose either C or D regardless of the message.\n\nLet's analyze the possible outcomes for Player 2:\n\n1. If Player 1 chooses C:\n   - If Player 2 chooses C, their payoff is 5.\n   - If Player 2 chooses D, their payoff is 6.\n\n2. If Player 1 chooses D:\n   - If Player 2 chooses C, their payoff is 0.\n   - If Player 2 chooses D, their payoff is 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the best response for Player 2 in each case:\n\n1. If Player 1 chooses C, Player 2 should choose D to maximize their payoff (6 > 5).\n2. If Player 1 chooses D, Player 2 should choose D to maximize their payoff (2 > 0).\n\nIn both cases, Player 2's best response is to choose D. Therefore, to maximize their expected payoff in response to the message, Player 2 should choose D."
