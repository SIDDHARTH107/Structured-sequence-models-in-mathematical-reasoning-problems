    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for the student to solve:\n\n\"A person standing on top of a 50-meter high lighthouse spots a boat in the ocean, which is at an angle of depression of 30 degrees. How far away is the boat from the lighthouse, to the nearest meter? Assume the water is flat.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. Since we know the angle of depression and the height of the lighthouse, we can use the tangent function to find the distance between the boat and the lighthouse.\n\nLet's denote the distance between the boat and the lighthouse as x. We can set up the following equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(30°) = (height of lighthouse) / x\n\ntan(30°) = 50 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 50 / tan(30°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 86.6025403784\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the boat is approximately 87 meters away from the lighthouse."
