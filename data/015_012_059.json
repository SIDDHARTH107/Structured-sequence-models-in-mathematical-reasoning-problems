    "message_1": "Here's an example problem:\n\nWhat are the coordinates of the point where the Lorenz attractor and its three-dimensional structure intersect, given the parameter values of σ = 10, β = 8/3, and ρ = 28?\n\nTo solve the problem, the student would need to use the Lorenz equations and the known parameter values to generate a plot of the Lorenz attractor. They would then need to find the point(s) where the attractor intersects with the three-dimensional structure, and report the coordinates of those points.",
    "message_2": "The Lorenz attractor is defined by the following system of differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = σ(y - x)\ndy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y\ndz/dt = xy - βz\n\nGiven the parameter values σ = 10, β = 8/3, and ρ = 28, we can find the equilibrium points (also known as the fixed points) of the Lorenz attractor. These points are the intersections of the attractor with its three-dimensional structure.\n\nTo find the equilibrium points, we set the derivatives dx/dt, dy/dt, and dz/dt equal to zero and solve for x, y, and z:\n\n0 = 10(y - x)\n0 = x(28 - z) - y\n0 = xy - (8/3)z\n\nSolving these equations, we find three equilibrium points:\n\n1. (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)\n2. (x, y, z) = (√(β(ρ-1)), √(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1) = (√(8/3 * 27), √(8/3 * 27), 27)\n3. (x, y, z) = (-√(β(ρ-1)), -√(β(ρ-1)), ρ-1) = (-√(8/3 * 27), -√(8/3 * 27), 27)\n\nSo, the coordinates of the points where the Lorenz attractor intersects with its three-dimensional structure are (0, 0, 0), (√(8/3 * 27), √(8/3 * 27), 27), and (-√(8/3 * 27), -√(8/3 * 27), 27)."
