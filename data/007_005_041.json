    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12, 16, and 18, we first need to find the prime factors of each number.\n\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n16 = 2^4\n18 = 2 * 3^2\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:\n\n2^4 (from 16)\n3^2 (from 18)\n\nMultiply these highest powers together:\n\nLCM = 2^4 * 3^2 = 16 * 9 = 144\n\nSo, the LCM of 12, 16, and 18 is 144."
