    "message_2": "First, let's find A × B, which is the Cartesian product of sets A and B. A × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}.\n\nNow, let's analyze the equation (A × B) △ C = A × (B △ D) △ E.\n\nThe symmetric difference (△) is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, (A △ B) = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nWe can rewrite the given equation as:\n\n(A × B) ∪ C - (A × B) ∩ C = (A × (B ∪ D) - A × (B ∩ D)) ∪ E - ((A × (B ∪ D) - A × (B ∩ D)) ∩ E)\n\nNow, let's find B △ D = (B ∪ D) - (B ∩ D). Since we don't have enough information about set D, we can't find the exact elements of B △ D. However, we can rewrite the equation in terms of B △ D:\n\n(A × B) ∪ C - (A × B) ∩ C = (A × (B △ D)) ∪ E - (A × (B △ D)) ∩ E\n\nSince we don't have enough information about sets C, D, and E, we can't find their exact elements. However, we can express the relationship between these sets using the given equation."
