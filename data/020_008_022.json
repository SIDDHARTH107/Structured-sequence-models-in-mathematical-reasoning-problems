The distances between each pair of cities are given in the following table:\n\n| Cities | A | B | C | D | E |\n|--------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A      | 0 | 5 | 2 | 7 | 9 |\n| B      | 5 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 3 |\n| C      | 2 | 1 | 0 | 6 | 2 |\n| D      | 7 | 4 | 6 | 0 | 5 |\n| E      | 9 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 0 |\n\nWhat is the minimum total distance required to connect all five cities, starting from city A and ending at city E?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum total distance required to connect all five cities, starting from city A and ending at city E, we can use the shortest path algorithm. One such algorithm is Dijkstra's algorithm. However, since there are only 5 cities, we can also solve this problem by checking all possible routes and finding the minimum distance.\n\nHere are all the possible routes from city A to city E:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → E\n2. A → B → C → E\n3. A → B → D → C → E\n4. A → B → D → E\n5. A → C → B → D → E\n6. A → C → B → E\n7. A → C → D → B → E\n8. A → C → D → E\n9. A → D → B → C → E\n10. A → D → B → E\n11. A → D → C → B → E\n12. A → D → C → E\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance for each route:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → E: 5 + 1 + 6 + 5 = 17\n2. A → B → C → E: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8\n3. A → B → D → C → E: 5 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 17\n4. A → B → D → E: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\n5. A → C → B → D → E: 2 + 1 + 4 + 5 = 12\n6. A → C → B → E: 2 + 1 + 3 = 6\n7. A → C → D → B → E: 2 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 15\n8. A → C → D → E: 2 + 6 + 5 = 13\n9. A → D → B → C → E: 7 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 14\n10. A → D → B → E: 7 + 4 + 3 = 14\n11. A → D → C → B → E: 7 + 6 + 1 + 3 = 17\n12. A → D → C → E: 7 + 6 + 2 = 15\n\nThe minimum total distance is 6, which corresponds to the route A → C → B → E."
