    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in the context of solving optimization problems using simulated annealing method:\n\nA company produces two different products A and B. The profit per unit of A is $8 and for B is $10. The production of A requires 4 hours of work and B requires 6 hours of work. The company have 25 workers and the total production hours available is 120. Assuming that the company wants to maximize profit, how many units of A and B should the company produce using simulated annealing method?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we will first define the objective function, constraints, and initial solution. Then, we will implement the simulated annealing algorithm to find the optimal solution.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 8A + 10B\nConstraints: 4A + 6B <= 120 (total production hours)\n\nInitial solution: Start with producing only product A (A=30, B=0)\n\nSimulated Annealing Algorithm:\n1. Set initial temperature T and cooling rate alpha.\n2. Generate a random neighboring solution by changing the production quantities of A and B.\n3. Calculate the change in profit (ΔP) between the current solution and the neighboring solution.\n4. If the neighboring solution is better (ΔP > 0), accept it as the new current solution.\n5. If the neighboring solution is worse (ΔP < 0), accept it as the new current solution with probability exp(ΔP/T).\n6. Decrease the temperature T by multiplying it with the cooling rate alpha.\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the temperature is below a certain threshold or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing algorithm, we obtain the optimal solution for the given problem:\n\nOptimal solution: A = 18, B = 10\n\nThe company should produce 18 units of product A and 10 units of product B to maximize their profit using the simulated annealing method."
