    "message_2": "To find the value of $\\tan^{-1}(1)+\\cos^{-1}(1/\\sqrt{2})$, we first need to find the individual values of $\\tan^{-1}(1)$ and $\\cos^{-1}(1/\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n1) $\\tan^{-1}(1)$: We are looking for an angle $\\theta$ such that $\\tan(\\theta) = 1$. This occurs when the opposite and adjacent sides of a right triangle are equal in length. A well-known example of such a triangle is the 45-45-90 triangle, where the two smaller angles are both 45 degrees or $\\pi/4$ radians. Therefore, $\\tan^{-1}(1) = \\pi/4$.\n\n2) $\\cos^{-1}(1/\\sqrt{2})$: We are looking for an angle $\\theta$ such that $\\cos(\\theta) = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. This also occurs in a 45-45-90 triangle, where the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse is $1/\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $\\cos^{-1}(1/\\sqrt{2}) = \\pi/4$.\n\nNow, we can add the two values together:\n\n$\\tan^{-1}(1)+\\cos^{-1}(1/\\sqrt{2}) = \\pi/4 + \\pi/4 = 2\\pi/4 = \\pi/2$.\n\nSo, the value of $\\tan^{-1}(1)+\\cos^{-1}(1/\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\pi/2$ radians."
