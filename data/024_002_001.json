    "message_2": "To find the geodesic on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 centered at the origin that passes through the points (2,0,0) and (-2,0,0), we can use the concept of great circles. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and its plane passes through the center of the sphere. Geodesics on the surface of a sphere are segments of great circles.\n\nThe sphere equation is given by:\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2, where R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nIn our case, R = 2, so the equation of the sphere is:\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4\n\nNow, we need to find the plane that contains the great circle passing through the points (2,0,0) and (-2,0,0) and the center of the sphere (0,0,0). Since the two points and the center are collinear along the x-axis, the plane containing the great circle is perpendicular to the x-axis.\n\nThe equation of the plane perpendicular to the x-axis and passing through the center of the sphere is:\ny^2 + z^2 = R^2\n\nIn our case, R = 2, so the equation of the plane is:\ny^2 + z^2 = 4\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of the sphere and the plane to get the equation of the geodesic. The intersection of the sphere and the plane is the set of points that satisfy both equations. Since both equations have y^2 + z^2, we can equate them:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = y^2 + z^2 + 4\n\nSimplifying, we get:\nx^2 = 4\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get two possible values for x:\nx = 2 or x = -2\n\nSince the geodesic passes through the points (2,0,0) and (-2,0,0), we can conclude that the geodesic is the set of points on the surface of the sphere where x = 2 or x = -2, and y^2 + z^2 = 4. This corresponds to two semicircles on the sphere, one in the positive x direction and the other in the negative x direction, both connecting the points (2,0,0) and (-2,0,0)."
