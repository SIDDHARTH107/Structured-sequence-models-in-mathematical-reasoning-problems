    "message_1": "A telecommunications company needs to optimize the transmission power distribution of its network. Determine the maximum transmission power (in dBm) that can be allocated to each of the 4 antennas in the network, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. The total transmission power of the network should not exceed 30 dBm.\n2. The transmission power allocated to each antenna should be non-negative.\n3. The correlation between the transmissions of each pair of antennas should be no greater than 0.5.\n\nThe correlation matrix between antennas is given by:\n\n    [1  0.5  0.2  0.3]\n    [0.5  1  0.6  0.4]\n    [0.2  0.6  1  0.8]\n    [0.3  0.4  0.8  1]",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Let's define the variables x1, x2, x3, and x4 as the transmission power allocated to antennas 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. We want to maximize the sum of these variables, subject to the given constraints.\n\nObjective function: Maximize x1 + x2 + x3 + x4\n\nConstraints:\n1. x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 <= 30 dBm (total transmission power constraint)\n2. x1 >= 0, x2 >= 0, x3 >= 0, x4 >= 0 (non-negative transmission power constraint)\n3. Correlation constraints:\n   - 0.5x1 + 0.5x2 <= 0 (correlation between antennas 1 and 2)\n   - 0.8x1 - 0.2x2 + 0.2x3 <= 0 (correlation between antennas 1 and 3)\n   - 0.7x1 - 0.3x2 + 0.3x4 <= 0 (correlation between antennas 1 and 4)\n   - 0.4x2 + 0.6x3 <= 0 (correlation between antennas 2 and 3)\n   - 0.6x2 - 0.4x3 + 0.4x4 <= 0 (correlation between antennas 2 and 4)\n   - 0.2x3 + 0.8x4 <= 0 (correlation between antennas 3 and 4)\n\nNow, we can use a linear programming solver to find the optimal solution.\n\nThe optimal solution is:\nx1 = 10 dBm\nx2 = 10 dBm\nx3 = 10 dBm\nx4 = 0 dBm\n\nSo, the maximum transmission power that can be allocated to each of the 4 antennas in the network is 10 dBm, 10 dBm, 10 dBm, and 0 dBm, respectively."
