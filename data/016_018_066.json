    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a self-similar set can be calculated using the formula:\n\ndim_H = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Cantor Dust obtained by removing the middle 1/4 intervals in each step, we have:\n\n- N = 2, since in each step we are left with two self-similar pieces.\n- r = 2, since each remaining interval is half the length of the previous interval (we remove the middle 1/4, so each of the remaining intervals is 3/4 the length of the previous interval, but there are two of them, so the scaling factor is 2).\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\ndim_H = log(2) / log(2) = 1\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor Dust obtained by removing the middle 1/4 intervals in each step is 1."
