    "message_2": "To find the coefficient of $x^7$ in the expansion of $(x+2)^5$, we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that for any non-negative integer $n$ and any real numbers $a$ and $b$:\n\n$(a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$\n\nIn our case, $a = x$, $b = 2$, and $n = 5$. We want to find the coefficient of $x^7$, but since the highest power of $x$ in the expansion is $x^5$, there will be no $x^7$ term in the expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of $x^7$ in the expansion of $(x+2)^5$ is 0."
