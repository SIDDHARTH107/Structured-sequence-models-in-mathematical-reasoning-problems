    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle, also known as the circumference, can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius.\n\nGiven a radius (r) of 5 cm, we can calculate the circumference as follows:\n\nC = 2 * 3.14159 * 5\nC ≈ 31.4159 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter (circumference) of the circle with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 31.4159 cm."
