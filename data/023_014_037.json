    "message_2": "To find the probability of the particle being located between x = -1 and x = 1, we need to calculate the integral of the square of the wave function over that interval:\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 1) = ∫[Ψ(x)]^2 dx from -1 to 1\n\nFirst, let's find the square of the wave function:\n\n[Ψ(x)]^2 = [2e^(-3|x|)]^2 = 4e^(-6|x|)\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts, one for the negative x values and one for the positive x values:\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 1) = ∫4e^(6x) dx from -1 to 0 + ∫4e^(-6x) dx from 0 to 1\n\nLet's solve the integrals:\n\n∫4e^(6x) dx = (4/6)e^(6x) + C1\n∫4e^(-6x) dx = (-4/6)e^(-6x) + C2\n\nNow, let's evaluate the integrals over the given intervals:\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 1) = [(4/6)e^(6x)] from -1 to 0 + [(-4/6)e^(-6x)] from 0 to 1\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 1) = [(4/6)(e^0 - e^(-6))] + [(-4/6)(e^(-6) - e^0)]\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 1) = (2/3)(1 - e^(-6)) + (-2/3)(e^(-6) - 1)\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 1) = (2/3)(1 - e^(-6) - e^(-6) + 1)\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 1) = (2/3)(2 - 2e^(-6))\n\nP(-1 ≤ x ≤ 1) ≈ 0.9974\n\nSo, the probability of the particle being located between x = -1 and x = 1 is approximately 0.9974 or 99.74%."
