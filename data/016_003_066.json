    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c does not diverge when iterated from z = 0. In other words, the sequence {0, c, c^2 + c, (c^2 + c)^2 + c, ...} is bounded.\n\nThe circle of radius 2 centered at the origin is significant because it can be shown that if a complex number c is outside this circle, the sequence will diverge. Conversely, if the sequence is bounded, then c must be inside the circle of radius 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the connected components of the Mandelbrot set within this circle. The Mandelbrot set is known to be connected, meaning that there is only one connected component within the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.\n\nSo, there is 1 connected component in the part of the Mandelbrot set that lies within the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin."
