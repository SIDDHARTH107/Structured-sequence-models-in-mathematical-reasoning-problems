    "message_1": "A certain region has 450 days of sunshine per year, and on average, it rains on 80 of those days. What is the probability that it will not rain on a randomly chosen day from this region?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that it will not rain on a randomly chosen day, we need to first find the total number of days in a year for this region. Since there are 450 days of sunshine and it rains on 80 of those days, there are a total of 450 + 80 = 530 days in a year for this region.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of days when it does not rain. Since it rains on 80 days, there are 450 - 80 = 370 days when it does not rain.\n\nThe probability that it will not rain on a randomly chosen day is the number of days when it does not rain divided by the total number of days in a year. So, the probability is 370/530 â‰ˆ 0.6981 or 69.81%."
