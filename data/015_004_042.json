    "message_2": "The largest circle that can fit entirely inside the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is known as the \"main cardioid circle\" or the \"largest Mandelbrot circle.\" It is tangent to the real axis at the point (0.25, 0) and has a radius of 0.25.\n\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 0.25.\n\nA = π(0.25)²\nA = π(0.0625)\nA ≈ 0.19634954084936207\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the area of the largest circle that can fit entirely inside the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is approximately 0.20."
