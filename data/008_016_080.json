    "message_2": "To apply the Jacobi iterative method, we first rewrite the given system of linear equations as follows:\n\n$x_1 = 4 - 2x_2 - x_3$\n\n$x_2 = (4x_1 + 2x_3 - 2) / 3$\n\n$x_3 = (6 - 3x_1 - x_2) / 4$\n\nNow, we start with the initial guess $x_0 = [0, 0, 0]$ and iterate using the above equations until the relative error is less than $10^{-3}$.\n\nIteration 1:\n$x_1^{(1)} = 4 - 2(0) - 0 = 4$\n$x_2^{(1)} = (4(0) + 2(0) - 2) / 3 = -2/3$\n$x_3^{(1)} = (6 - 3(0) - 0) / 4 = 3/2$\n\nIteration 2:\n$x_1^{(2)} = 4 - 2(-2/3) - 3/2 = 4 + 4/3 - 3/2 = 17/6$\n$x_2^{(2)} = (4(4) + 2(3/2) - 2) / 3 = (16 + 3 - 2) / 3 = 17/3$\n$x_3^{(2)} = (6 - 3(4) - (-2/3)) / 4 = (-6 + 2/3) / 4 = -22/12 = -11/6$\n\nWe continue this process and obtain the following values:\n\nIteration 3:\n$x_1^{(3)} = 151/30$\n$x_2^{(3)} = 307/90$\n$x_3^{(3)} = -179/60$\n\nIteration 4:\n$x_1^{(4)} = 757/150$\n$x_2^{(4)} = 1537/450$\n$x_3^{(4)} = -3599/1200$\n\nNow, we calculate the relative error between the last two iterations:\n\nRelative error for $x_1 = |(757/150 - 151/30)| / |757/150| = 0.000992$\nRelative error for $x_2 = |(1537/450 - 307/90)| / |1537/450| = 0.000992$\nRelative error for $x_3 = |(-3599/1200 - (-179/60))| / |-3599/1200| = 0.000992$\n\nSince the relative error for all variables is less than $10^{-3}$, we can stop the iterations here. The approximate solution using the Jacobi iterative method is:\n\n$x_1 \\approx 757/150$\n$x_2 \\approx 1537/450$\n$x_3 \\approx -3599/1200$"
