    "message_2": "To prove that f(z) is a constant function, we will use Liouville's theorem. Liouville's theorem states that any bounded entire function must be constant.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of an entire function. An entire function is a function that is holomorphic (complex differentiable) on the entire complex plane.\n\nNow, we are given that |f(z)| < 2017 for all z. This means that f(z) is a bounded entire function, since its absolute value is always less than a fixed constant (2017).\n\nBy Liouville's theorem, since f(z) is a bounded entire function, it must be a constant function. Therefore, f(z) is a constant function."
