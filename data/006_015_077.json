    "message_1": "Assuming that an average of 1 cyber attack occurs per day on a certain network, what is the probability that there will be no cyber attack for the next 2 days?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Poisson distribution to solve this problem. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, cyber attacks) occurring in a fixed interval of time (in this case, 2 days).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (cyber attacks) in the given time interval\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events (cyber attacks) per time interval (in this case, 1 cyber attack per day)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, 0 cyber attacks in 2 days)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of no cyber attacks in the next 2 days, we need to adjust the value of λ to represent the average number of cyber attacks in 2 days. Since there is an average of 1 cyber attack per day, there would be an average of 1 * 2 = 2 cyber attacks in 2 days.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-2) * 2^0) / 0!\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-2) * 1) / 1\n\nP(X = 0) = e^(-2)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.1353\n\nSo, the probability that there will be no cyber attack for the next 2 days is approximately 13.53%."
