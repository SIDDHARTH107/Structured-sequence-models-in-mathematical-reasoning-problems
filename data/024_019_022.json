    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature K over a closed surface S is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic χ of the surface:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ\n\nThe surface S defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 is a sphere with radius 1. The Euler characteristic χ of a sphere is 2. Therefore, according to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the integral of the Gaussian curvature K over the surface S is:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ = 2π(2) = 4π\n\nNow let's calculate the Gaussian curvature K for the surface S. The Gaussian curvature K is given by the formula:\n\nK = (k1 * k2)\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are the principal curvatures of the surface. For a sphere of radius r, the principal curvatures are equal and given by:\n\nk1 = k2 = 1/r\n\nIn our case, the radius r is 1, so the principal curvatures are:\n\nk1 = k2 = 1\n\nThus, the Gaussian curvature K for the surface S is:\n\nK = (k1 * k2) = (1 * 1) = 1\n\nNow we can calculate the integral of the Gaussian curvature K over the surface S:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = ∫∫_S (1) dA = Area(S)\n\nSince the Gaussian curvature K is constant over the surface S, the integral is equal to the area of the surface S. The area of a sphere with radius 1 is given by:\n\nArea(S) = 4π(1)^2 = 4π\n\nTherefore, the integral of the Gaussian curvature K over the surface S is:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 4π\n\nThis result is consistent with the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature K over a closed surface S is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic χ of the surface. In this case, the Euler characteristic χ of the sphere is 2, so the Gauss-Bonnet theorem gives:\n\n∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ = 2π(2) = 4π"
