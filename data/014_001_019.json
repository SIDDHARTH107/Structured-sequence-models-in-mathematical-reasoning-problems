    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using RSA encryption with p = 7, q = 11, and e = 17, follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q = 7 * 11 = 77.\n2. Compute the totient function, φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = (7 - 1) * (11 - 1) = 6 * 10 = 60.\n3. The public key is (n, e) = (77, 17).\n4. Convert the message \"HELLO\" into numerical form using ASCII or Unicode values. In this case, we'll use ASCII values: H = 72, E = 69, L = 76, L = 76, O = 79.\n5. Encrypt each numerical value using the formula: C ≡ M^e (mod n), where C is the encrypted value, M is the numerical value of the message, e is the public exponent, and n is the product of the two primes.\n\nEncryption calculations:\nC_H ≡ 72^17 (mod 77) = 64\nC_E ≡ 69^17 (mod 77) = 52\nC_L ≡ 76^17 (mod 77) = 1\nC_O ≡ 79^17 (mod 77) = 19\n\n6. The encrypted message is the sequence of encrypted numerical values: 64, 52, 1, 1, 19.\n\nSo, the encrypted message using RSA encryption with p = 7, q = 11, and e = 17 is \"64 52 1 1 19\"."
