    "message_2": "To disconnect a complete graph of 7 vertices, we need to ensure that at least one vertex is not connected to any other vertex in the graph. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. So, for a graph with 7 vertices, each vertex has 6 edges connecting it to the other 6 vertices.\n\nTo disconnect the graph, we can remove all 6 edges connected to one vertex. This will leave that vertex disconnected from the rest of the graph. Therefore, the minimum number of edges that can be removed to disconnect a complete graph of 7 vertices is 6."
