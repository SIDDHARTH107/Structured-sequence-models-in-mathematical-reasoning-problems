The mass-spring system is initially at rest but is then given an initial displacement of 0.1 m from its equilibrium position. Find the equation of motion for the mass-spring system and determine the amplitude, period, and frequency of the resulting oscillations.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for the mass-spring system, we can use Hooke's Law and Newton's second law. Hooke's Law states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to its displacement from the equilibrium position:\n\nF = -kx\n\nwhere F is the force exerted by the spring, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nNewton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:\n\nF = ma\n\nFor a mass-spring system, the force acting on the mass is the force exerted by the spring, so we can write:\n\nma = -kx\n\nThe acceleration is the second derivative of the displacement with respect to time:\n\na = d^2x/dt^2\n\nSo, we have the following differential equation:\n\nm(d^2x/dt^2) = -kx\n\nFor our given values of m = 0.5 kg and k = 50 N/m, the equation becomes:\n\n0.5(d^2x/dt^2) = -50x\n\nNow, we can solve this differential equation to find the equation of motion for the mass-spring system. The general solution for this type of equation is:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(ωt) + B*sin(ωt)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, ω is the angular frequency, and t is time. Since the mass-spring system is initially at rest, the initial velocity is 0:\n\nv(0) = dx/dt = -Aω*sin(ωt) + Bω*cos(ωt)\n\nAt t = 0, v(0) = 0:\n\n0 = -Aω\n\nSince ω cannot be 0, A must be 0. So, the equation of motion becomes:\n\nx(t) = B*sin(ωt)\n\nThe initial displacement is 0.1 m:\n\nx(0) = B*sin(0) = 0.1\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, B = 0.1 m. The equation of motion is:\n\nx(t) = 0.1*sin(ωt)\n\nNow, we can find the angular frequency, ω, using the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nω = sqrt(50/0.5) = sqrt(100) = 10 rad/s\n\nThe equation of motion is:\n\nx(t) = 0.1*sin(10t)\n\nThe amplitude of the oscillations is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, which is equal to the constant B:\n\nAmplitude = 0.1 m\n\nThe period of the oscillations is the time it takes for one complete cycle, which can be found using the formula:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nT = 2π/10 = π/5 s\n\nThe frequency of the oscillations is the number of cycles per second, which is the reciprocal of the period:\n\nf = 1/T\n\nf = 1/(π/5) = 5/π Hz\n\nSo, the amplitude, period, and frequency of the resulting oscillations are 0.1 m, π/5 s, and 5/π Hz, respectively."
