    "message_2": "In a block design experiment with 10 treatments and 5 blocks, each block containing 2 treatments, we can use combinatorics to determine the number of different block designs possible.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 treatments out of 10. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of treatments (10), k is the number of treatments per block (2), and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!8!)\nC(10, 2) = (10 × 9 × 8!)/(2 × 8!)\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nSo, there are 45 ways to choose 2 treatments out of 10.\n\nNow, we need to distribute these 45 pairs of treatments into 5 blocks. Since each block must contain exactly 2 treatments, we can think of this as dividing the 45 pairs into groups of 5.\n\nTo do this, we can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which represent the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets. The Stirling number S(n, k) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nHowever, in this case, we can simplify the problem by realizing that we are essentially choosing 5 pairs out of the 45 possible pairs, without regard to the order in which they are chosen. This can be calculated using the combination formula again:\n\nC(45, 5) = 45! / (5!(45-5)!)\nC(45, 5) = 45! / (5!40!)\nC(45, 5) = (45 × 44 × 43 × 42 × 41 × 40!)/(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 × 40!)\nC(45, 5) = 1,221,759\n\nSo, there are 1,221,759 different block designs possible with 10 treatments, 5 blocks, and 2 treatments per block."
