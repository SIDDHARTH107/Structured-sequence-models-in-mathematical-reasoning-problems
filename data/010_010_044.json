    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient of $f$ is given by the vector of its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\nabla f(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (2x, 2y)$.\n\nNow, we set the gradient to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nThus, the only critical point is $(0, 0)$.\n\nNow, we use Morse theory to determine the nature of this critical point. The Hessian matrix of $f$ is given by the matrix of its second partial derivatives:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are the solutions to the characteristic equation:\n\n$\\det(H(f) - \\lambda I) = \\begin{vmatrix}\n2 - \\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 - \\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix} = (2 - \\lambda)^2 = 0$.\n\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the Hessian matrix is positive definite, and by Morse theory, the critical point $(0, 0)$ is a local minimum."
