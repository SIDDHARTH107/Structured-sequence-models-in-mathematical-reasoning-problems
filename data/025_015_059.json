    "message_2": "Given the equation x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1, we are asked to find the coordinates of all points on the surface with x = 2. \n\nFirst, substitute x = 2 into the equation:\n\n(2)^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1\n4 + y^2 - z^2 = 1\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate y^2:\n\ny^2 - z^2 = -3\n\nThis is a difference of squares equation, which can be factored as:\n\n(y - z)(y + z) = -3\n\nSince y and z can be any real numbers, there are infinitely many solutions for (y, z) that satisfy the equation. Therefore, the coordinates of all points on the surface with x = 2 are:\n\n(2, y, z), where (y - z)(y + z) = -3"
