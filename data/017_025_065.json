There is 1 cyclic group (C120), 1 alternating group (A5 × C2 × C2), and 487 non-abelian groups, making a total of:\n\n1 (cyclic group) + 1 (alternating group) + 487 (non-abelian groups) = 489\n\nSo, there are 489 non-isomorphic groups of order 120 that can be constructed from the given subtopic in Group theory."
