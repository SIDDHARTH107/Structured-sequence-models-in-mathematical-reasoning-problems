    "message_1": "In a party with 6 people, at least how many pairs of people must know each other to ensure there is a group of 3 people who all know each other (or) 3 people who are all strangers to each other?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider one person at the party. This person can either know or not know each of the other 5 people at the party. So, there are 2 possibilities for each of the 5 relationships, which means there are 2^5 = 32 possible combinations of relationships for this person.\n\nNow, let's divide these 32 possibilities into \"pigeonholes\" based on the number of people this person knows at the party. There are 6 pigeonholes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, representing the number of people this person knows.\n\nIf this person knows 0 people, then the other 5 people are all strangers to them. If this person knows all 5 people, then the other 5 people all know them. In either of these cases, we have a group of 3 people who either all know each other or are all strangers to each other (since there are 3 people among the other 5).\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where this person knows 1, 2, 3, or 4 people. If this person knows 1, 2, or 3 people, then there must be at least 3 people who either know or don't know this person. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one group of 3 people who either all know or don't know this person. In either case, we have a group of 3 people who either all know each other or are all strangers to each other.\n\nIf this person knows 4 people, then there must be at least 3 people who either know or don't know this person (since there are only 2 people who don't know this person). By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one group of 3 people who either all know or don't know this person. In either case, we have a group of 3 people who either all know each other or are all strangers to each other.\n\nSo, in any case, there must be at least one group of 3 people who either all know each other or are all strangers to each other. To ensure this, we need to consider the minimum number of pairs of people that must know each other.\n\nLet's assume the worst-case scenario, where there are 2 people who know each other and 3 people who don't know each other. In this case, there are 3 pairs of people who know each other and 3 pairs of people who don't know each other. However, this situation doesn't guarantee a group of 3 people who either all know each other or are all strangers to each other.\n\nTo guarantee this, we need to add one more pair of people who know each other. This will create a group of 3 people who all know each other. So, the minimum number of pairs of people who must know each other to ensure there is a group of 3 people who all know each other (or) 3 people who are all strangers to each other is 4."
