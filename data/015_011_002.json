    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question on the double pendulum that a math student could solve:\n\nAssuming the masses of the two pendulums are equal and each rod has a length of 1 meter, find the initial conditions required for the double pendulum system to enter into chaotic behavior. Provide numerical values for the angles and angular velocities of both pendulums.",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum is a highly nonlinear system, and predicting its chaotic behavior is not a straightforward task. However, we can provide an example of initial conditions that are known to lead to chaotic behavior.\n\nConsider the following initial conditions:\n\n1. The first pendulum (upper pendulum) is at an angle of θ1 = 150° (or 5π/6 radians) from the vertical.\n2. The second pendulum (lower pendulum) is at an angle of θ2 = 0° (or 0 radians) from the vertical.\n3. Both pendulums have an initial angular velocity of 0 (ω1 = ω2 = 0).\n\nThese initial conditions are known to result in chaotic behavior for the double pendulum system. Keep in mind that this is just one example, and there are many other initial conditions that can lead to chaotic behavior."
