    "message_1": "In a group of volunteers, there are 5 people who have committed to putting in 10 hours of work each towards a project that requires a total of 50 hours to complete. Each volunteer is given the choice to either put in the work or slack off. If all 5 volunteers work, the project will be completed in 10 hours. If less than 5 volunteers work, the project will not be completed. However, if only 4 volunteers work, they will each receive a bonus payment of $20. If only 3 volunteers work, they will each receive a bonus payment of $50. What is the best decision for each volunteer in terms of maximizing their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best decision for each volunteer in terms of maximizing their own payoff, we need to analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n1. If all 5 volunteers work, the project will be completed, but there will be no bonus payment. The payoff for each volunteer is $0.\n\n2. If 4 volunteers work and 1 slacks off, the project will be completed, and the 4 working volunteers will each receive a bonus payment of $20. The payoff for each working volunteer is $20, while the slacking volunteer gets $0.\n\n3. If 3 volunteers work and 2 slack off, the project will not be completed, so no bonus payment will be given. The payoff for all volunteers is $0.\n\n4. If 2 or fewer volunteers work, the project will not be completed, and there will be no bonus payment. The payoff for all volunteers is $0.\n\nFrom these outcomes, we can see that the best decision for each volunteer in terms of maximizing their own payoff is to be one of the 4 volunteers who work and receive a bonus payment of $20. However, this situation presents a dilemma: if every volunteer tries to maximize their payoff by being one of the 4 working volunteers, there is a risk that more than one volunteer will slack off, leading to the project not being completed and no bonus payments being given.\n\nIn conclusion, the best decision for each volunteer in terms of maximizing their own payoff is to work and hope that only one other volunteer slacks off, so they can receive the $20 bonus payment. However, this strategy is risky and may lead to the project not being completed if more than one volunteer slacks off."
