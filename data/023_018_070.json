    "message_2": "To find the steady-state response of the system, we first need to find the Laplace transform of the input signal f(t) = 2cos(2t) - sin(3t).\n\nThe Laplace transform of f(t) is given by:\n\nF(s) = L{2cos(2t) - sin(3t)} = 2L{cos(2t)} - L{sin(3t)}\n\nUsing the Laplace transform properties, we have:\n\nL{cos(at)} = s/(s^2 + a^2) and L{sin(at)} = a/(s^2 + a^2)\n\nSo, F(s) = 2(s/(s^2 + 4)) - (3/(s^2 + 9))\n\nNow, we need to find the output Laplace transform Y(s) by multiplying the transfer function H(s) with the input Laplace transform F(s):\n\nY(s) = H(s) * F(s) = [(3s + 5)/(s^2 + 4s + 3)] * [2(s/(s^2 + 4)) - (3/(s^2 + 9))]\n\nTo find the steady-state response, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){Y(s)}\n\nBefore finding the inverse Laplace transform, we need to perform partial fraction decomposition on Y(s). We can rewrite Y(s) as:\n\nY(s) = A(s) / (s^2 + 4) + B(s) / (s^2 + 9) + C(s) / (s^2 + 4s + 3)\n\nwhere A(s), B(s), and C(s) are polynomials in s.\n\nAfter performing partial fraction decomposition, we get:\n\nY(s) = (s + 1) / (s^2 + 4) - 1 / (s^2 + 9) + 2 / (s^2 + 4s + 3)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s):\n\ny(t) = L^(-1){(s + 1) / (s^2 + 4)} - L^(-1){1 / (s^2 + 9)} + L^(-1){2 / (s^2 + 4s + 3)}\n\nUsing the inverse Laplace transform properties, we have:\n\nL^(-1){(s + 1) / (s^2 + 4)} = cos(2t) + sin(2t)\nL^(-1){1 / (s^2 + 9)} = (1/3)sin(3t)\nL^(-1){2 / (s^2 + 4s + 3)} = e^(-2t)\n\nSo, the steady-state response y(t) is:\n\ny(t) = (cos(2t) + sin(2t)) - (1/3)sin(3t) + e^(-2t)\n\nThis is the steady-state response of the system to the input signal f(t) = 2cos(2t) - sin(3t)."
