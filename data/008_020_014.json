    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n```\n2x - 3y + 4z = 10\n3x + 2y - z = 3\n2x + y - 2z = 0\n4x - y + 3z = 4\n```\nSolve the system of equations using matrix equations and find the values of x, y, and z.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix equations, we first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2 -3  4 | 10]\n[ 3  2 -1 |  3]\n[ 2  1 -2 |  0]\n[ 4 -1  3 |  4]\n```\n\nNext, we perform Gaussian elimination to obtain a row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap row 1 and row 2:\n```\n[ 3  2 -1 |  3]\n[ 2 -3  4 | 10]\n[ 2  1 -2 |  0]\n[ 4 -1  3 |  4]\n```\n\n2. Replace row 2 with (-2/3)row 1 + row 2, row 3 with (-2/3)row 1 + row 3, and row 4 with (-4/3)row 1 + row 4:\n```\n[ 3   2  -1 |   3]\n[ 0  -5   6 |   8]\n[ 0  -1/3 -4/3|  -2]\n[ 0  -5/3  5 |  -4]\n```\n\n3. Multiply row 3 by -3 and swap row 2 and row 3:\n```\n[ 3   2  -1 |   3]\n[ 0   1   4 |   6]\n[ 0  -5   6 |   8]\n[ 0  -5/3  5 |  -4]\n```\n\n4. Replace row 1 with (-2)row 2 + row 1, row 3 with 5row 2 + row 3, and row 4 with (5/3)row 2 + row 4:\n```\n[ 3   0  -9 |  -9]\n[ 0   1   4 |   6]\n[ 0   0  26 |  38]\n[ 0   0   5 |   6]\n```\n\n5. Divide row 3 by 26 and row 4 by 5:\n```\n[ 3   0  -9 |  -9]\n[ 0   1   4 |   6]\n[ 0   0   1 |  38/26]\n[ 0   0   1 |   6/5]\n```\n\n6. Replace row 1 with 9row 3 + row 1, row 2 with -4row 3 + row 2, and row 4 with (-6/5)row 3 + row 4:\n```\n[ 3   0   0 |   3]\n[ 0   1   0 |  -2]\n[ 0   0   1 |  19/13]\n[ 0   0   0 | -14/13]\n```\n\nThe last row of the row-echelon form indicates that there is no solution to the system of linear equations, as 0x + 0y + 0z = -14/13 is not possible. Therefore, the given system of linear equations has no solution."
