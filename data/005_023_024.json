    "message_1": "Mrs. Smith's math class has taken a statistics test, and these are the scores: 70, 82, 88, 90, 95, 97, 98, 99. Determine the outlier(s) in the data set using the Tukey method with k = 1.5.",
    "message_2": "To determine the outliers using the Tukey method, we first need to find the interquartile range (IQR). \n\nStep 1: Arrange the data in ascending order: 70, 82, 88, 90, 95, 97, 98, 99\n\nStep 2: Find the median (Q2): Since there are 8 data points, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th data points: (88 + 90) / 2 = 89\n\nStep 3: Find the lower quartile (Q1): The lower quartile is the median of the lower half of the data. In this case, it's the average of the 2nd and 3rd data points: (82 + 88) / 2 = 85\n\nStep 4: Find the upper quartile (Q3): The upper quartile is the median of the upper half of the data. In this case, it's the average of the 6th and 7th data points: (97 + 98) / 2 = 97.5\n\nStep 5: Calculate the interquartile range (IQR): IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 97.5 - 85 = 12.5\n\nStep 6: Determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers: \n- Lower bound: Q1 - k * IQR = 85 - 1.5 * 12.5 = 85 - 18.75 = 66.25\n- Upper bound: Q3 + k * IQR = 97.5 + 1.5 * 12.5 = 97.5 + 18.75 = 116.25\n\nStep 7: Identify the outliers: Any data points below the lower bound or above the upper bound are considered outliers. In this case, there are no data points below 66.25 or above 116.25.\n\nTherefore, there are no outliers in the data set using the Tukey method with k = 1.5."
