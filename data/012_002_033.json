    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of G, we first need to find the maximum degree of the vertices in the graph (Δ(G)). The chromatic number of G is at most Δ(G) + 1, according to Brooks' theorem.\n\nSince G has 10 vertices and 12 edges, we can use the Handshaking Lemma to find the sum of the degrees of all vertices:\n\nSum of degrees = 2 * (number of edges) = 2 * 12 = 24\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario for the maximum degree. If one vertex has the maximum possible degree, it would be connected to all other vertices. In this case, the maximum degree would be 9 (connected to all other 9 vertices). However, this would require 9 edges, leaving only 3 edges for the remaining 9 vertices, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the maximum degree must be less than 9. Let's try Δ(G) = 8. In this case, one vertex is connected to 8 other vertices, leaving 4 edges for the remaining 8 vertices. This is possible, for example, by having two disconnected subgraphs: one with 3 vertices and 3 edges (forming a triangle), and the other with 7 vertices and 9 edges (with one vertex connected to the other 6 vertices).\n\nSo, Δ(G) = 8. According to Brooks' theorem, the chromatic number of G is at most Δ(G) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nHowever, we can do better than that. Notice that the graph G is not a complete graph (it would require 10 * 9 / 2 = 45 edges) nor an odd cycle (it would require an odd number of edges). Therefore, by Brooks' theorem, the chromatic number of G is at most Δ(G) = 8.\n\nIn conclusion, the chromatic number of G is 8."
