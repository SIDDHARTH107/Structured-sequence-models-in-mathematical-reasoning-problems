    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper k-colorings of the graph G.\n\nLet's analyze the graph G:\n\n1. Vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a complete graph K4, which means that they are all connected to each other.\n2. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 3 and 4.\n\nNow, let's apply the deletion-contraction algorithm:\n\n1. Delete edge (3,4) to obtain graph G1. The chromatic polynomial of G1 is P(G1, k).\n2. Contract edge (3,4) to obtain graph G2. The chromatic polynomial of G2 is P(G2, k).\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of G is P(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G2, k).\n\nFor G1, we have the following edges: {(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,5),(4,5)}. This graph has a K3 subgraph (vertices 1, 2, and 3) and two additional edges (3,5) and (4,5). The chromatic polynomial of G1 is P(G1, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + (k-3)(k-2)^2.\n\nFor G2, we have the following edges after contracting edge (3,4): {(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,5)}. This graph is a complete graph K4 with an additional edge (3,5). The chromatic polynomial of G2 is P(G2, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) - (k-3)(k-2).\n\nNow, we can find the chromatic polynomial of G:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(G2, k)\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + (k-3)(k-2)^2] - [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) - (k-3)(k-2)]\nP(G, k) = (k-3)(k-2)^2 - (k-3)(k-2)\nP(G, k) = (k-3)(k-2)[(k-2) - 1]\nP(G, k) = (k-3)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G is P(G, k) = (k-3)(k-2)(k-3)."
