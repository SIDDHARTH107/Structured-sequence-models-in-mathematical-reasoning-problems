    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider the heat equation in complex analysis, given by:\n\n$u_t = k u_{xx}$\n\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is a complex-valued function, $k$ is a constant, $x$ and $t$ are real variables denoting space and time respectively. If the initial condition is given by:\n\n$u(x,0) = \\sin(x) + i\\cos(x)$\n\nand the boundary conditions are:\n\n$u(0,t) = u(\\pi,t) = 0$\n\nFind the solution $u(x,t)$ for $t > 0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T'(t) = kX''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $kX(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{kT(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ and the right side is a function of $x$, they must both be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{kT(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$\n2) $T'(t) + k\\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(\\pi,t) = 0$, we get:\n\n$X(0) = A = 0$ and $X(\\pi) = B\\sin(\\lambda \\pi) = 0$\n\nSince $B \\neq 0$, we must have $\\lambda \\pi = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. Thus, $\\lambda = n$ and the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X_n(x) = B_n\\sin(nx)$\n\nNow, solving the second equation, we get:\n\n$T'(t) + kn^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\n$T_n(t) = C_n e^{-kn^2t}$\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\n$u_n(x,t) = X_n(x)T_n(t) = B_n\\sin(nx)C_n e^{-kn^2t}$\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(x) + i\\cos(x)$:\n\n$u(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n\\sin(nx)C_n = \\sin(x) + i\\cos(x)$\n\nWe can find the coefficients $B_n$ and $C_n$ by using the orthogonality of the sine functions:\n\n$B_n\\sin(nx)C_n = \\sin(x) + i\\cos(x)$\n\nTaking the real and imaginary parts separately:\n\n$B_n\\sin(nx) = \\sin(x)$\n$B_n\\sin(nx) = i\\cos(x)$\n\nUsing the orthogonality property, we can find the coefficients:\n\n$B_1 = 1$, $C_1 = 1$\n$B_n = 0$, $C_n = 0$ for $n > 1$\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin(x)e^{-k t}$"
