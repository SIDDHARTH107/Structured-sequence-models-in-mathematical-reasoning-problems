    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Burnside's Lemma (also known as the Cauchy-Frobenius Lemma). Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct objects (in this case, bracelets) is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group of symmetries acting on the objects.\n\nFor a bracelet with 12 beads, there are 12 rotational symmetries (rotating by 0, 1, 2, ..., 11 beads) and 12 reflectional symmetries (reflecting across each of the 12 axes). So, there are 24 symmetries in total.\n\nNow, we will count the number of fixed points for each symmetry:\n\n1. Identity (0-bead rotation): All bracelets are fixed, so there are 2^6 = 64 fixed points (since there are 6 positions where a bead can be either black or white).\n\n2. Rotations by 1, 5, 7, and 11 beads: No bracelets are fixed, as the black and white beads will not match up after rotation.\n\n3. Rotations by 2, 4, 8, and 10 beads: The bracelet must be symmetric after rotation, so there must be a black-white pair at each of the 6 positions. There is only 1 such bracelet: alternating black and white beads.\n\n4. Rotation by 3, 6, and 9 beads: The bracelet must be symmetric after rotation, so there must be a black-white pair at each of the 4 positions. There is only 1 such bracelet: two black beads followed by two white beads, repeated twice.\n\n5. Reflections: For a bracelet to be symmetric under reflection, it must have a black-white pair at each of the 6 positions. There are 2 such bracelets: one with a black bead followed by a white bead, and the other with a white bead followed by a black bead.\n\nNow, we can apply Burnside's Lemma:\n\nNumber of distinct bracelets = (Number of fixed points) / (Number of symmetries)\n= (64 + 0 + 4 + 3 + 12) / 24\n= 83 / 24\n= 3.4583...\n\nSince the number of distinct bracelets must be an integer, we round down to get the final answer: 3 distinct bracelets can be made using six black beads and six white beads, considering rotation and reflection as the same."
