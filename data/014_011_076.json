    "message_1": "A company wants to encrypt a secret message using a Transposition Cipher. The message is \"MEET ME AFTER WORK\" and the encryption key is \"4321\". What is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using a Transposition Cipher with the key \"4321\", we first need to write the message in a grid with the number of columns equal to the length of the key. In this case, the key has 4 digits, so we will have 4 columns. We will remove the spaces in the message and write it in the grid row by row:\n\nM E E T\nM E A F\nT E R W\nO R K\n\nNow, we will read the columns in the order specified by the key. The first column is the 4th, the second column is the 3rd, the third column is the 2nd, and the fourth column is the 1st. Reading the columns in this order, we get the encrypted message:\n\nTMRWEOEKEEAFMT\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"TMRWEOEKEEAFMT\"."
