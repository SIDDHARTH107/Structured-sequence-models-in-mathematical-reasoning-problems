This means that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two sets, and the structure of the sets is preserved. In this case, the isomorphism can be represented by the function f(x, y) = (x, (y, 6)), where (x, y) is an element of A × B.\n\nSo, while (A × B) × {6} and A × (B × {6}) are not equal, they are isomorphic, which means they have the same structure and can be considered equivalent in some contexts."
