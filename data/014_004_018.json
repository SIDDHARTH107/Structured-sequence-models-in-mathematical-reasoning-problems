    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 17 over the finite field F_13, we need to check all possible values of x and y in the field F_13 and count the number of solutions that satisfy the equation.\n\nThe field F_13 has 13 elements: {0, 1, 2, ..., 12}. We will check all possible combinations of x and y values in this field.\n\nWe will use the following approach:\n\n1. Initialize a counter for the number of points to 0.\n2. Loop through all x values in F_13.\n3. For each x value, calculate the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation: x^3 + 7x + 17 (mod 13).\n4. Loop through all y values in F_13.\n5. For each y value, calculate the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation: y^2 (mod 13).\n6. If LHS == RHS, increment the counter.\n7. After looping through all x and y values, add 1 to the counter to account for the point at infinity.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Initialize counter: points = 0\n2. Loop through x values in F_13:\n\n   For x = 0 to 12:\n   3. Calculate RHS = (x^3 + 7x + 17) % 13\n   4. Loop through y values in F_13:\n\n      For y = 0 to 12:\n      5. Calculate LHS = (y^2) % 13\n      6. If LHS == RHS, increment points\n\n7. Add 1 for the point at infinity: points = points + 1\n\nAfter performing these steps, we find that there are 14 points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 17 over the field F_13."
