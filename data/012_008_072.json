    "message_2": "Euler's formula for planar graphs states that for a connected planar graph:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 8 and E = 11. We want to determine if there exists a value for F that satisfies the equation.\n\nLet's rearrange the formula to solve for F:\n\nF = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - 8 + 11\nF = -6 + 11\nF = 5\n\nSince F is a positive integer, it is possible that the graph G is planar. However, we also need to check if G satisfies the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn this case:\n\n11 ≤ 3(8) - 6\n11 ≤ 24 - 6\n11 ≤ 18\n\nSince the inequality holds, the graph G is indeed planar."
