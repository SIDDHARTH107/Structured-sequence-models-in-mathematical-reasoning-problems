The transportation costs (in dollars) between the warehouses and stores are given in the matrix below:\n\n|   | Store 1 | Store 2 | Store 3 | Store 4 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Warehouse 1 | $10$ | $20$ | $30$ | $25$ |\n| Warehouse 2 | $15$ | $25$ | $30$ | $20$ |\n| Warehouse 3 | $35$ | $15$ | $20$ | $10$ |\n\nUsing the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm, find the minimum cost of transporting the goods from the warehouses to the retail stores.",
    "message_2": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. In this problem, we will use the ABC algorithm to find the minimum cost of transporting goods from warehouses to retail stores.\n\n1. Initialization: Set the parameters of the ABC algorithm, such as the number of employed bees, onlooker bees, and the maximum number of iterations. Initialize the positions of the employed bees randomly in the search space.\n\n2. Employed Bee Phase: Each employed bee searches for a new solution in the neighborhood of its current position. If the new solution has a better fitness (lower cost), the bee updates its position.\n\n3. Onlooker Bee Phase: Onlooker bees evaluate the solutions found by the employed bees and probabilistically choose a solution based on its fitness. The onlooker bees then search for new solutions in the neighborhood of the chosen solution.\n\n4. Scout Bee Phase: If an employed bee cannot improve its solution after a certain number of iterations, it becomes a scout bee and starts searching for a new solution randomly in the search space.\n\n5. Termination: Repeat steps 2-4 until the maximum number of iterations is reached or another stopping criterion is met. The best solution found during the search process is the minimum cost of transporting goods from warehouses to retail stores.\n\nApplying the ABC algorithm to the given problem, we can find the minimum cost of transporting goods from the warehouses to the retail stores. Since the ABC algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, the results may vary in different runs. However, after running the algorithm multiple times, we can find a near-optimal solution for this problem.\n\nFor example, one possible near-optimal solution could be:\n- Warehouse 1 supplies Store 1: $10\n- Warehouse 2 supplies Store 4: $20\n- Warehouse 3 supplies Store 2: $15\n- Warehouse 3 supplies Store 3: $20\n\nThe total cost of this solution is $10 + $20 + $15 + $20 = $65."
