    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^p - 1, where p is a prime number. For 2^p - 1 to be a Mersenne prime, p must also be prime.\n\nLet's start with the smallest prime number, p = 2:\n2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3, which is prime.\n\nSo, the smallest possible value of p for which 2^p - 1 is a Mersenne prime is p = 2."
