    "message_2": "To find the velocity of the car after 5 seconds, we need to integrate the acceleration function a(t) with respect to time t.\n\na(t) = 3t + 2\n\nLet v(t) be the velocity function. Then,\n\nv(t) = âˆ«(3t + 2) dt\n\nNow, we integrate:\n\nv(t) = (3/2)t^2 + 2t + C\n\nSince the car starts from rest, its initial velocity is 0. So, when t = 0:\n\n0 = (3/2)(0)^2 + 2(0) + C\n0 = C\n\nThus, the velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = (3/2)t^2 + 2t\n\nNow, we find the velocity of the car after 5 seconds by plugging t = 5 into the velocity function:\n\nv(5) = (3/2)(5)^2 + 2(5)\nv(5) = (3/2)(25) + 10\nv(5) = 37.5 + 10\nv(5) = 47.5\n\nThe velocity of the car after 5 seconds is 47.5 m/s."
