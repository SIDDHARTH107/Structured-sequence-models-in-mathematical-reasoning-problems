    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order n is congruent to 1 mod p and divides n.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. Therefore, we need to consider the Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups. Then, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1: This corresponds to the direct product of the Sylow subgroups, which is a group of order 120. This group is isomorphic to Z_8 × Z_3 × Z_5.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 1: This corresponds to the semidirect product of Z_8 × Z_5 with Z_3. There are two non-isomorphic groups in this case: the direct product Z_8 × Z_3 × Z_5 and the non-abelian group Z_8 ⋊ Z_3 × Z_5.\n\n3. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 6: This corresponds to the semidirect product of Z_8 × Z_3 with Z_5. There are two non-isomorphic groups in this case: the direct product Z_8 × Z_3 × Z_5 and the non-abelian group Z_8 × Z_3 ⋊ Z_5.\n\n4. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 6: This corresponds to the semidirect product of Z_8 with Z_3 and Z_5. There are four non-isomorphic groups in this case: the direct product Z_8 × Z_3 × Z_5, the non-abelian group Z_8 ⋊ Z_3 × Z_5, the non-abelian group Z_8 × Z_3 ⋊ Z_5, and the non-abelian group Z_8 ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_5).\n\n5. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1: This corresponds to the semidirect product of Z_3 × Z_5 with Z_4 × Z_2. There are two non-isomorphic groups in this case: the direct product (Z_4 × Z_2) × Z_3 × Z_5 and the non-abelian group (Z_4 × Z_2) ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_5).\n\nIn total, there are 9 non-isomorphic groups of order 120:\n\n1. Z_8 × Z_3 × Z_5\n2. Z_8 ⋊ Z_3 × Z_5\n3. Z_8 × Z_3 ⋊ Z_5\n4. Z_8 ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_5)\n5. (Z_4 × Z_2) × Z_3 × Z_5\n6. (Z_4 × Z_2) ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_5)"
