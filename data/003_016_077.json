    "message_1": "A sinusoidal wave has an equation of y = 4cos(2x - pi/3). Determine the phase shift of the wave.",
    "message_2": "The general equation for a sinusoidal wave is y = A*cos(B(x - C)), where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn the given equation, y = 4cos(2x - pi/3), we can see that A = 4, B = 2, and (2 * C) = pi/3.\n\nTo find the phase shift C, we can divide both sides of the equation (2 * C) = pi/3 by 2:\n\nC = (pi/3) / 2\nC = pi/6\n\nSo, the phase shift of the wave is pi/6 radians."
