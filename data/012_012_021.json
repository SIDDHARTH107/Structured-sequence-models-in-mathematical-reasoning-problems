    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle. In order to determine the girth of the given graph, we can use the following inequality:\n\ng ≤ 2 * m / n + 1\n\nwhere g is the girth, m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices.\n\nIn our case, we have m = 12 and n = 8. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ng ≤ 2 * 12 / 8 + 1\ng ≤ 3 + 1\ng ≤ 4\n\nSince the girth is an integer value, the possible values for the girth are 3 or 4. However, if the girth were 3, it would mean that there is a triangle in the graph. In such a case, the maximum number of edges in the graph would be given by Turán's theorem:\n\nm ≤ (n^2 - n * g) / (2 * (g - 1))\n\nPlugging in n = 8 and g = 3, we get:\n\nm ≤ (8^2 - 8 * 3) / (2 * (3 - 1))\nm ≤ (64 - 24) / 4\nm ≤ 40 / 4\nm ≤ 10\n\nSince the given graph has 12 edges, which is more than the maximum number of edges allowed for a graph with 8 vertices and girth 3, the girth cannot be 3. Therefore, the girth of the graph must be 4."
