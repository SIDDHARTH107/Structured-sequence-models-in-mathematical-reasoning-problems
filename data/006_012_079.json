    "message_1": "What is the probability of a house being burglarized at least once in a year in a neighborhood with 500 houses if the average rate of burglarization in the neighborhood is 1.5 houses per week?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson probability distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, burglaries) occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of burglaries per year in the neighborhood. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the average number of burglaries per year is:\n\n1.5 houses/week * 52 weeks/year = 78 houses/year\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson distribution formula to find the probability of a house being burglarized at least once in a year. The formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given interval\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events in the given interval (in this case, 78 houses/year)\n- k is the number of events we are interested in (in this case, k = 1 for at least one burglary)\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of a house not being burglarized at all (k = 0):\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-78) * 78^0) / 0!\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-78) * 1) / 1\nP(X = 0) = e^(-78)\n\nNow, to find the probability of a house being burglarized at least once (k ≥ 1), we can subtract the probability of no burglaries (k = 0) from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - e^(-78)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 1 - 7.94 * 10^(-35)\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 0.9999999999999999999999999999999999206\n\nSo, the probability of a house being burglarized at least once in a year in the neighborhood is approximately 99.99999999999999999999999999999999%."
