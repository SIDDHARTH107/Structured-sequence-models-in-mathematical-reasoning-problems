    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" using a rail fence cipher with a depth of 3, we arrange the letters in a zigzag pattern with 3 rows:\n\nM   E   I\n A T M T C\n  H   A   S\n\nNow, we read the ciphertext by going through each row from left to right:\n\nMEIATMTCHAS\n\nSo, the ciphertext produced by the encryption process is \"MEIATMTCHAS\"."
