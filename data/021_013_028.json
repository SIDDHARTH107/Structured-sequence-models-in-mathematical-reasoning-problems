    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA factory wants to minimize the cost of producing a certain item. The cost is a function of the production rate per hour (x) and the number of workers employed (y) and is defined as: \n\nC(x,y) = 2x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy - 32x - 48y + 200\n\nUsing simulated annealing method, determine the production rate per hour and the number of workers to employ that will minimize the cost of production. Note that the production rate per hour can take values from 1 to 10, while the number of workers can be between 2 and 8.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the temperature T and the cooling rate alpha.\n2. Generate an initial solution (x, y) randomly within the given constraints.\n3. Calculate the cost C(x, y) using the given function.\n4. Repeat the following steps until the temperature T is sufficiently low:\n   a. Generate a new solution (x', y') by perturbing the current solution (x, y) within the constraints.\n   b. Calculate the cost C(x', y') using the given function.\n   c. If C(x', y') < C(x, y), accept the new solution (x', y').\n   d. If C(x', y') >= C(x, y), accept the new solution (x', y') with probability exp((C(x, y) - C(x', y')) / T).\n   e. Update the temperature T = alpha * T.\n\n5. The final solution (x, y) will be the one that minimizes the cost of production.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the simulated annealing method for this problem:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef cost_function(x, y):\n    return 2 * x**2 + 4 * y**2 + 4 * x * y - 32 * x - 48 * y + 200\n\ndef random_neighbor(x, y):\n    return random.randint(1, 10), random.randint(2, 8)\n\ndef simulated_annealing(T, alpha):\n    x, y = random_neighbor(1, 2)\n    cost = cost_function(x, y)\n\n    while T > 1e-6:\n        x_new, y_new = random_neighbor(x, y)\n        new_cost = cost_function(x_new, y_new)\n        delta_cost = new_cost - cost\n\n        if delta_cost < 0 or math.exp(-delta_cost / T) > random.random():\n            x, y, cost = x_new, y_new, new_cost\n\n        T *= alpha\n\n    return x, y, cost\n\nT = 1000\nalpha = 0.99\nx, y, cost = simulated_annealing(T, alpha)\nprint(f\"Production rate per hour: {x}, Number of workers: {y}, Minimum cost: {cost}\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the production rate per hour and the number of workers that minimize the cost of production. Note that the results may vary slightly due to the random nature of the simulated annealing method."
