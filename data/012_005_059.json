    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In other words, it is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nIn the worst case, the graph G can be a tree (a connected graph with no cycles). In this case, the diameter of the tree is the longest path between any two vertices.\n\nFor a tree with 10 vertices, the maximum number of edges is 10 - 1 = 9. However, G has 15 edges, which means it must contain cycles. The presence of cycles can only decrease the diameter, as they provide alternative shorter paths between vertices.\n\nTo find the upper bound for the diameter of G, we can consider the case where G is a tree with 10 vertices and 9 edges. The longest path in such a tree can be found by arranging the vertices in a straight line, where each vertex is connected to its adjacent vertices. In this case, the diameter is 9 (the distance between the first and last vertices).\n\nSince adding more edges to the graph can only decrease the diameter, the diameter of G must be less than or equal to 9. Without more information about the specific structure of G, we cannot determine the exact diameter, but we can conclude that the diameter of G is at most 9."
