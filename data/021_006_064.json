    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using finite element methods, we will first discretize the spatial domain and then apply the Galerkin method to obtain a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Finally, we will use a suitable time-stepping scheme to solve the ODEs.\n\n1. Discretize the spatial domain:\nDivide the interval [0, 1] into N equal subintervals of length h = 1/N. Let x_i = i * h for i = 0, 1, ..., N. We will approximate the solution u(x, t) by a linear combination of basis functions:\n\nu(x, t) ≈ U(x, t) = ∑(U_i(t) * φ_i(x))\n\nwhere U_i(t) are the coefficients to be determined and φ_i(x) are the hat functions defined as:\n\nφ_i(x) = (x - x_(i-1))/h for x_(i-1) ≤ x ≤ x_i\nφ_i(x) = (x_(i+1) - x)/h for x_i ≤ x ≤ x_(i+1)\nφ_i(x) = 0 otherwise\n\n2. Apply the Galerkin method:\nMultiply the PDE by a test function φ_j(x) and integrate over the spatial domain:\n\n∫(∂U/∂t * φ_j(x) dx) = ∫(D * ∂²U/∂x² * φ_j(x) dx)\n\nIntegrate the right-hand side by parts:\n\n∫(D * ∂²U/∂x² * φ_j(x) dx) = -∫(D * ∂U/∂x * ∂φ_j/∂x dx)\n\nSubstitute the approximation U(x, t) into the equation:\n\n∫(∂(∑(U_i(t) * φ_i(x)))/∂t * φ_j(x) dx) = -∫(D * ∂(∑(U_i(t) * φ_i(x)))/∂x * ∂φ_j/∂x dx)\n\nNow, we can switch the order of summation and integration:\n\n∑(U_i(t) * ∫(∂φ_i(x)/∂t * φ_j(x) dx)) = -D * ∑(U_i(t) * ∫(∂φ_i(x)/∂x * ∂φ_j/∂x dx))\n\nThe integrals on the left-hand side are zero for all i ≠ j, and equal to 1 for i = j. The integrals on the right-hand side can be computed analytically, resulting in a tridiagonal matrix. We obtain a system of ODEs:\n\ndU_i(t)/dt = -D * ∑(A_ij * U_j(t))\n\nwhere A_ij are the elements of the tridiagonal matrix.\n\n3. Time-stepping scheme:\nTo ensure stability and accuracy, we can use the implicit Crank-Nicolson method. Let U_i^(n) be the approximation of U_i(t) at time t_n = n * Δt. The Crank-Nicolson method is:\n\nU_i^(n+1) - U_i^(n) = -D * Δt/2 * (∑(A_ij * U_j^(n+1)) + ∑(A_ij * U_j^(n)))\n\nThis is a linear system of equations that can be solved for U^(n+1) at each time step.\n\n4. Initial and boundary conditions:\nThe initial condition is given by u(x, 0) = x(1-x). We can project this function onto the basis functions to obtain the initial coefficients U_i(0):\n\nU_i(0) = ∫(x(1-x) * φ_i(x) dx)\n\nThe boundary conditions u(0, t) = u(1, t) = 0 are already satisfied by the basis functions φ_i(x).\n\nIn summary, to solve the given PDE using finite element methods, we first discretize the spatial domain and apply the Galerkin method to obtain a system of ODEs. Then, we use the Crank-Nicolson time-stepping scheme to solve the ODEs, ensuring stability and accuracy. Finally, we apply the initial and boundary conditions to obtain the numerical solution."
