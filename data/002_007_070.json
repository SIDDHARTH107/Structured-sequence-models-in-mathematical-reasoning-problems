    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 9 cm and the lengths of its two bases are 5 cm and 12 cm. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 9 cm, and the lengths of the bases are 5 cm and 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (5 + 12) * 9\n\nArea = (1/2) * (17) * 9\n\nArea = 8.5 * 9\n\nArea = 76.5 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 76.5 square centimeters."
