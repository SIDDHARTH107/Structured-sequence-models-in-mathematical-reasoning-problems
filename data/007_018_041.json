    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes greater than 1,000, we need to find the first pair of primes with the smallest difference. The first few prime numbers greater than 1,000 are 1009, 1013, 1019, 1021, 1031, and so on.\n\nThe smallest prime gap between two consecutive primes greater than 1,000 is between 1013 and 1009. The difference between these two primes is 1013 - 1009 = 4. Therefore, the smallest prime gap is 4."
