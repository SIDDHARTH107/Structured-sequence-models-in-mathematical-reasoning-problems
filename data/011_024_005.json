    "message_1": "A network flow problem involves a directed graph with a source node and a sink node, where each edge has a capacity that determines the maximum amount of flow that can travel through it. Suppose you have the following network:\n\n```\n   +---3--->  \n   |         | \n   1         2\n   |         | \n   +---4--->  \n```\n\nThe capacities of the edges are as follows: capacity(1,2) = 8, capacity(1,3) = 4, capacity(2,4) = 5, capacity(3,2) = 1, and capacity(3,4) = 6. What is the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from node 1 to node 4?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node 1 to node 4, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We start by initializing the flow in each edge to 0 and then iteratively find augmenting paths from the source to the sink, increasing the flow along the path until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path from node 1 to node 4: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The minimum capacity along this path is min(8, 5) = 5. We update the flow along this path:\n\n   Flow(1,2) = 5, Flow(2,4) = 5\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path: 1 -> 3 -> 4. The minimum capacity along this path is min(4, 6) = 4. We update the flow along this path:\n\n   Flow(1,3) = 4, Flow(3,4) = 4\n\n3. Now, we find another augmenting path: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4. The minimum capacity along this path is min(4 - Flow(1,3), 1, 5 - Flow(2,4)) = min(0, 1, 0) = 0. Since the minimum capacity is 0, we cannot increase the flow along this path.\n\nAt this point, we cannot find any more augmenting paths, so we have found the maximum flow. The maximum flow from node 1 to node 4 is the sum of the flows along the edges entering node 4:\n\n   Max flow = Flow(2,4) + Flow(3,4) = 5 + 4 = 9"
