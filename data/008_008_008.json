    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, product A and product B. The company has limited resources and can produce a maximum of 600 units of product A and 800 units of product B per day. The company needs 3 hours and 4 hours to produce one unit of product A and B, respectively. The profit of $5 and $4 is earned on each unit of product A and B, respectively. Find the number of units of each product the company should produce per day to maximize profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced per day and y be the number of units of product B produced per day. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 4y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x ≤ 600 (maximum units of product A)\n2. y ≤ 800 (maximum units of product B)\n3. 3x + 4y ≤ 24h (total production time available per day, where h is the number of hours available)\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of h (total production time available per day). We can do this by using the maximum production limits for both products:\n\n3(600) + 4(800) = 1800h + 3200h = 5000h\n\nNow we can rewrite constraint 3 as:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 5000\n\nNow we have a linear programming problem with the objective function P(x, y) = 5x + 4y and the constraints x ≤ 600, y ≤ 800, and 3x + 4y ≤ 5000. To solve this problem, we can use the graphical method by plotting the feasible region and finding the vertices.\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the constraints intersect:\n\n1. (0, 0) - intersection of x = 0 and y = 0\n2. (600, 0) - intersection of x = 600 and y = 0\n3. (0, 800) - intersection of x = 0 and y = 800\n4. (600, 400) - intersection of x = 600 and 3x + 4y = 5000\n5. (1000, 0) - intersection of y = 0 and 3x + 4y = 5000 (not feasible since x > 600)\n6. (0, 1250) - intersection of x = 0 and 3x + 4y = 5000 (not feasible since y > 800)\n\nNow we can evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of the feasible vertices:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = 0\n2. P(600, 0) = 5(600) + 4(0) = 3000\n3. P(0, 800) = 5(0) + 4(800) = 3200\n4. P(600, 400) = 5(600) + 4(400) = 3000 + 1600 = 4600\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (600, 400), with a profit of $4600 per day. Therefore, the company should produce 600 units of product A and 400 units of product B per day to maximize profit."
