    "message_2": "To compute the number of points on the elliptic curve $E(\\mathbb{F}_7)$, we will check all possible values of $x$ in the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$ and see if there is a corresponding $y$ value that satisfies the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 1$. If there is, we will count the number of points for that particular $x$ value.\n\nFor each $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_7 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, we compute $x^3 + 1$:\n\n1. For $x = 0$, we have $y^2 = 0^3 + 1 = 1$. There are two solutions for $y$: $y = 1$ and $y = 6$. So, we have 2 points: $(0, 1)$ and $(0, 6)$.\n2. For $x = 1$, we have $y^2 = 1^3 + 1 = 2$. There are no solutions for $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n3. For $x = 2$, we have $y^2 = 2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. There are no solutions for $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n4. For $x = 3$, we have $y^2 = 3^3 + 1 = 27 + 1 = 28 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. There are two solutions for $y$: $y = 0$ and $y = 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. So, we have 1 point: $(3, 0)$.\n5. For $x = 4$, we have $y^2 = 4^3 + 1 = 64 + 1 = 65 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. There are no solutions for $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n6. For $x = 5$, we have $y^2 = 5^3 + 1 = 125 + 1 = 126 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. There are two solutions for $y$: $y = 0$ and $y = 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. So, we have 1 point: $(5, 0)$.\n7. For $x = 6$, we have $y^2 = 6^3 + 1 = 216 + 1 = 217 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. There are two solutions for $y$: $y = 1$ and $y = 6$. So, we have 2 points: $(6, 1)$ and $(6, 6)$.\n\nSo, we have found a total of 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 6 points on the elliptic curve $E(\\mathbb{F}_7)$. However, we also need to include the point at infinity, which is always a part of an elliptic curve. Therefore, the total number of points on $E(\\mathbb{F}_7)$ is 6 + 1 = 7."
