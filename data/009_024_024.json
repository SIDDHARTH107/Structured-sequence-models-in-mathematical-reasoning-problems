Assume that $\\rho = 1$ and $\\nu = 0.1$. Use a numerical method of your choice to solve the problem and plot the velocity field and pressure distribution at different times.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use a numerical method called the Finite Difference Method (FDM). We will discretize the spatial domain into a grid and approximate the derivatives using finite differences. We will also use the Forward Euler method for time integration.\n\nFirst, let's discretize the spatial domain into a grid with $N_x$ and $N_y$ points in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. The grid spacing in the $x$ and $y$ directions are $\\Delta x = \\frac{L}{N_x - 1}$ and $\\Delta y = \\frac{H}{N_y - 1}$, respectively.\n\nNext, we will approximate the derivatives in the Navier-Stokes equations using finite differences. For example, the second-order central difference approximation for the second derivative in the $x$ direction is:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1,j} - 2u_{i,j} + u_{i-1,j}}{(\\Delta x)^2}$\n\nwhere $u_{i,j}$ is the velocity component $u$ at the grid point $(i, j)$.\n\nSimilarly, we can approximate all the other derivatives in the Navier-Stokes equations using finite differences. Then, we can use the Forward Euler method for time integration:\n\n$u_{i,j}^{n+1} = u_{i,j}^n + \\Delta t \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right)_{i,j}^n$\n\nwhere $\\Delta t$ is the time step and $u_{i,j}^n$ is the velocity component $u$ at the grid point $(i, j)$ and time step $n$.\n\nNow, we can implement the numerical method in a programming language like Python and solve the problem for the given initial conditions and boundary conditions. Here's a sample code to get started:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Parameters\nL = 10\nH = 2\nrho = 1\nnu = 0.1\nNx = 51\nNy = 21\nNt = 100\ndt = 1 / Nt\n\n# Grid\nx = np.linspace(0, L, Nx)\ny = np.linspace(0, H, Ny)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n\n# Initialize velocity and pressure\nu = np.zeros((Ny, Nx))\nv = np.zeros((Ny, Nx))\np = np.zeros((Ny, Nx))\n\n# Initial conditions\nu[:, :] = 6 * X * (H - Y) / H**2\nv[:, :] = 0\n\n# Time integration\nfor n in range(Nt):\n    un = u.copy()\n    vn = v.copy()\n    pn = p.copy()\n\n    # Update velocity and pressure using finite differences and Forward Euler method\n    # ...\n\n# Plot the velocity field and pressure distribution at different times\n# ...\n```\n\nAfter implementing the numerical method and solving the problem, you can plot the velocity field and pressure distribution at different times using a library like Matplotlib."
