    "message_1": "A 20-pound force is applied to lift an object vertically 5 feet. How much work is done in lifting the object? Use integration to find the work done.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done in lifting the object, we can use the formula for work, which is:\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\n\nIn this case, the force is 20 pounds, the distance is 5 feet, and the angle θ is 0 degrees (since the force is applied vertically). The cosine of 0 degrees is 1, so the formula simplifies to:\n\nWork = Force × Distance\n\nNow, we can use integration to find the work done. Let's integrate the force with respect to the distance:\n\nWork = ∫(20)dx from 0 to 5\n\nThe integral of a constant (20) is 20x:\n\nWork = 20x evaluated from 0 to 5\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = 20(5) - 20(0) = 100 - 0 = 100\n\nSo, the work done in lifting the object is 100 foot-pounds."
