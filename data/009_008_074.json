    "message_1": "Consider the wave equation, u_tt = c^2 u_xx, where u is the displacement of a string, c is the wave speed, t is time, and x is the spatial coordinate. \n\nSuppose a string of length 10 units is fixed at both ends and is initially at rest, except for a displacement of u(x,0) = sin(pi*x/10) at time t = 0. Find the displacement u(x,t) of the string at time t = 0.5 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation with the given initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution is of the form u(x, t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\nX''(x)T(t) = c^2 X(x)T''(t)\n\nDivide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = c^2 T''(t)/T(t)\n\nSince the left side is a function of x only and the right side is a function of t only, they must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -k^2:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = -k^2\nc^2 T''(t)/T(t) = -k^2\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + k^2 X(x) = 0\nc^2 T''(t) + k^2 T(t) = 0\n\nSolve the first equation for X(x):\n\nX(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)\n\nSince the string is fixed at both ends, we have the boundary conditions X(0) = X(10) = 0:\n\nX(0) = B = 0\nX(10) = A sin(10k) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(10k) = 0, which implies that k = nπ/10 for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, solve the second equation for T(t):\n\nT(t) = C_n cos(c k_n t) + D_n sin(c k_n t)\n\nSince the string is initially at rest, we have the initial condition u_t(x, 0) = 0:\n\n0 = -C_n c k_n sin(c k_n 0) + D_n c k_n cos(c k_n 0)\n\nThis implies that D_n = 0 for all n. Thus, the general solution is:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [A_n sin(k_n x) cos(c k_n t)]\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients A_n to satisfy the initial displacement condition u(x, 0) = sin(πx/10):\n\nsin(πx/10) = Σ [A_n sin(k_n x)]\n\nComparing the two sides, we see that A_1 = 1 and A_n = 0 for n ≠ 1. Therefore, the solution is:\n\nu(x, t) = sin(πx/10) cos(cπt/10)\n\nFinally, we can find the displacement u(x, t) at time t = 0.5 seconds:\n\nu(x, 0.5) = sin(πx/10) cos(cπ(0.5)/10)"
