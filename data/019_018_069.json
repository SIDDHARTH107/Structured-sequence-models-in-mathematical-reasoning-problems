    "message_2": "To prove that (n^2 + 2n) is an even number for all positive integers n, we can use the property that the product or sum of two even numbers is also even.\n\nAn even number can be represented as 2k, where k is an integer.\n\nLet's rewrite the expression (n^2 + 2n) using this representation:\n\nn^2 + 2n = n(n + 2)\n\nNow, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: n is even\nIf n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. In this case, the expression becomes:\n\nn(n + 2) = (2k)(2k + 2)\n\nWe can factor out a 2 from the second term:\n\nn(n + 2) = 2k(2k + 1)\n\nSince the product of two integers is an integer, let's say that 2k(2k + 1) = 2m, where m is an integer. Thus, the expression is even in this case.\n\nCase 2: n is odd\nIf n is odd, then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. In this case, the expression becomes:\n\nn(n + 2) = (2k + 1)(2k + 1 + 2)\n\nSimplify the second term:\n\nn(n + 2) = (2k + 1)(2k + 3)\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the second term:\n\nn(n + 2) = (2k + 1)(2(k + 1) + 1)\n\nWe can see that both terms in the product are odd, and the product of two odd numbers is odd. However, since we are adding 2n to n^2, the result will be even:\n\nn(n + 2) = (2k + 1)(2(k + 1) + 1) + 2n\n\nLet's say that (2k + 1)(2(k + 1) + 1) + 2n = 2m, where m is an integer. Thus, the expression is even in this case as well.\n\nIn both cases, (n^2 + 2n) is an even number for all positive integers n. Therefore, we have proved that (n^2 + 2n) is an even number for all positive integers n."
