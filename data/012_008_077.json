    "message_2": "To determine if a graph is planar or non-planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nWe are given a graph G with 10 vertices (V = 10) and 16 edges (E = 16). We can also use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nLet's check if the inequality holds for our graph:\n\n16 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n16 ≤ 30 - 6\n16 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds, so it is possible that the graph is planar. However, this inequality is not a guarantee that the graph is planar, so we need to check further.\n\nWe can also use Kuratowski's theorem, which states that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph with 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition). In our case, the graph has 10 vertices, so it cannot contain a subdivision of K5 as a subgraph since K5 has only 5 vertices.\n\nNow let's check for K3,3. A K3,3 graph has 9 edges, and since our graph has 16 edges, it is possible that it contains a K3,3 subgraph. However, we cannot conclude definitively without more information about the specific connections between vertices in the graph.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, it is possible that the graph is planar, but we cannot definitively determine if it is planar or non-planar without more information about the specific connections between vertices."
