    "message_1": "A magician has a bag of 10 balls, consisting of 5 red and 5 blue balls. If he randomly selects 3 balls from the bag, what is the probability of getting at least 2 red balls?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 2 red balls, we can consider the two possible scenarios: getting exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball, or getting all 3 red balls. We will calculate the probabilities of these scenarios and then add them together.\n\n1. Probability of getting exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball:\nThere are C(5,2) ways to choose 2 red balls from the 5 available, and C(5,1) ways to choose 1 blue ball from the 5 available. So, there are C(5,2) * C(5,1) ways to choose 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\nC(5,2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 10\nC(5,1) = 5! / (1! * (5-1)!) = 5\nSo, there are 10 * 5 = 50 ways to choose 2 red balls and 1 blue ball.\n\nThere are a total of C(10,3) ways to choose any 3 balls from the 10 available.\nC(10,3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!) = 120\n\nThe probability of getting exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball is:\nP(2 red, 1 blue) = (Number of ways to choose 2 red balls and 1 blue ball) / (Total number of ways to choose 3 balls)\nP(2 red, 1 blue) = 50 / 120\n\n2. Probability of getting all 3 red balls:\nThere are C(5,3) ways to choose 3 red balls from the 5 available.\nC(5,3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10\n\nThe probability of getting all 3 red balls is:\nP(3 red) = (Number of ways to choose 3 red balls) / (Total number of ways to choose 3 balls)\nP(3 red) = 10 / 120\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of these two scenarios to find the probability of getting at least 2 red balls:\nP(at least 2 red) = P(2 red, 1 blue) + P(3 red) = (50 / 120) + (10 / 120) = 60 / 120\n\nThe probability of getting at least 2 red balls is 60/120, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5."
