    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy$, we first need to find its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$f_x(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 - 3y$$\n$$f_y(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 - 3x$$\n\nNow, we set both partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$3x^2 - 3y = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = y$$\n$$3y^2 - 3x = 0 \\Rightarrow y^2 = x$$\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously:\n\n$$x^2 = y \\Rightarrow x^4 = x \\Rightarrow x(x^3 - 1) = 0$$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $x$: $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. Plugging these values back into the equations, we get the corresponding $y$ values:\n\nFor $x = 0$, we have $y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$.\nFor $x = 1$, we have $y^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow y = 1$.\n\nSo, we have two critical points: $(0, 0)$ and $(1, 1)$.\n\nNow, we need to classify these critical points using Morse theory. To do this, we need to find the second partial derivatives of $f$:\n\n$$f_{xx}(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x$$\n$$f_{yy}(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y$$\n$$f_{xy}(x, y) = f_{yx}(x, y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = -3$$\n\nNow, we compute the Hessian matrix $H$:\n\n$$H = \\begin{bmatrix} f_{xx} & f_{xy} \\\\ f_{yx} & f_{yy} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 6x & -3 \\\\ -3 & 6y \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nWe will now evaluate the Hessian matrix at each critical point and compute its determinant:\n\n1. For the critical point $(0, 0)$:\n\n$$H(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -3 \\\\ -3 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n$$\\det(H(0, 0)) = (0)(0) - (-3)(-3) = -9$$\n\nSince the determinant is negative, the critical point $(0, 0)$ is a saddle point.\n\n2. For the critical point $(1, 1)$:\n\n$$H(1, 1) = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 & -3 \\\\ -3 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n$$\\det(H(1, 1)) = (6)(6) - (-3)(-3) = 36 - 9 = 27$$\n\nSince the determinant is positive and $f_{xx}(1, 1) = 6 > 0$, the critical point $(1, 1)$ is a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy$ has two critical points: $(0, 0)$, which is a saddle point, and $(1, 1)$, which is a local minimum."
