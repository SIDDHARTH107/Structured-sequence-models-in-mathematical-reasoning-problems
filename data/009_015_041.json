    "message_1": "Suppose a sample of a radioactive substance has an initial mass of 150 grams and has a half-life of 12 years. If the mass of the substance is reduced to 37.5 grams, how long has it been decaying?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nfinal mass = initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the final mass is 37.5 grams, the initial mass is 150 grams, and the half-life is 12 years. We need to find the time elapsed.\n\n37.5 = 150 * (1/2)^(time elapsed / 12)\n\nTo solve for the time elapsed, we can first divide both sides by 150:\n\n37.5 / 150 = (1/2)^(time elapsed / 12)\n\n0.25 = (1/2)^(time elapsed / 12)\n\nNow, we can take the logarithm of both sides to solve for the exponent:\n\nlog(0.25) = log((1/2)^(time elapsed / 12))\n\nlog(0.25) = (time elapsed / 12) * log(1/2)\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by log(1/2) to isolate the time elapsed:\n\nlog(0.25) / log(1/2) = time elapsed / 12\n\n2 = time elapsed / 12\n\nFinally, we can multiply both sides by 12 to find the time elapsed:\n\n2 * 12 = time elapsed\n\n24 = time elapsed\n\nSo, the radioactive substance has been decaying for 24 years."
