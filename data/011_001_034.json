    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct lineups the coach can make, we need to find the number of combinations of 7 players taken 5 at a time. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of players (7) and k is the number of players in the lineup (5).\n\nC(7, 5) = 7! / (5!(7-5)!)\nC(7, 5) = 7! / (5!2!)\nC(7, 5) = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)(2 * 1))\nC(7, 5) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\nC(7, 5) = 42 / 2\nC(7, 5) = 21\n\nSo, the coach can make 21 distinct lineups for the starting five players."
