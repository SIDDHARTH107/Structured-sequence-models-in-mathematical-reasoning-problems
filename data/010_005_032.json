    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the concept of path-connectedness. A topological space X is path-connected if for any two points p, q ∈ X, there exists a continuous map f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) = p and f(1) = q. Since X is connected, we will show that it is also path-connected.\n\nSuppose for contradiction that X is not path-connected. Then there exist points p, q ∈ X such that there is no continuous map f: [0,1] → X with f(0) = p and f(1) = q. We will construct two disjoint non-empty open sets A and B whose union is X, which will contradict the connectedness of X.\n\nDefine A = {x ∈ X | there exists a continuous map g: [0,1] → X with g(0) = p and g(1) = x} and B = X \\ A. Note that A and B are disjoint, and their union is X.\n\nWe claim that A and B are both non-empty open sets. Since p ∈ A, A is non-empty. To show that A is open, let x ∈ A. Then there exists a continuous map g: [0,1] → X with g(0) = p and g(1) = x. Since g is continuous, there exists an open neighborhood U of x such that g^(-1)(U) is open in [0,1]. Since g^(-1)(U) contains 1, there exists an open interval (1-ε, 1] ⊆ g^(-1)(U) for some ε > 0. Define h: [0,1] → X by h(t) = g(1 - εt). Then h is continuous, h(0) = p, and h(1) = g(1 - ε) ∈ U. Thus, U ⊆ A, which implies that A is open.\n\nSince X is connected, it is not the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Therefore, our assumption that X is not path-connected must be false. Thus, X is path-connected, and there exists a continuous map f: [0,1] → X such that f(0) = p and f(1) = q."
