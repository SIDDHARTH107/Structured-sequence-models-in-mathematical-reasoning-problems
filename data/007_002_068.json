    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 6, 9, and 15, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of each number:\n6 = 2 × 3\n9 = 3²\n15 = 3 × 5\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:\n2: highest power is 2^1 (from 6)\n3: highest power is 3^2 (from 9)\n5: highest power is 5^1 (from 15)\n\nMultiply these highest powers together to get the LCM:\nLCM = 2^1 × 3^2 × 5^1 = 2 × 9 × 5 = 18 × 5 = 90\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 6, 9, and 15 is 90."
