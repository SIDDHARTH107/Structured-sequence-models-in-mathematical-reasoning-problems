    "message_1": "Alice receives an encrypted message \"SRFG\" from Bob. Bob tells Alice that he used Vigenere Cipher to encrypt the message and the keyword he used was \"MATH\". Using cryptanalysis techniques, determine the keyword and decrypt the message.",
    "message_2": "Since Bob has already provided the keyword \"MATH\", we can proceed to decrypt the message using the Vigenere Cipher.\n\nThe Vigenere Cipher uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A table of alphabets can be used, termed a tabula recta, Vigenere square, or Vigenere table. It consists of the alphabet written out 26 times in different rows, each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar Ciphers.\n\nTo decrypt the message, we will reverse the encryption process. We will use the keyword \"MATH\" and the encrypted message \"SRFG\". We align the keyword and the encrypted message and then use the Vigenere table to find the original message.\n\nKeyword:   M A T H M A T H\nEncrypted: S R F G\n\n1. For the first letter, we go to the row starting with 'M' and find the column with 'S'. The letter at the top of that column is 'P'.\n2. For the second letter, we go to the row starting with 'A' and find the column with 'R'. The letter at the top of that column is 'A'.\n3. For the third letter, we go to the row starting with 'T' and find the column with 'F'. The letter at the top of that column is 'R'.\n4. For the fourth letter, we go to the row starting with 'H' and find the column with 'G'. The letter at the top of that column is 'T'.\n\nSo, the decrypted message is \"PART\"."
