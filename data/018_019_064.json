    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 3, 6, 7} be two sets. Find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) △ A and A △ (B △ A), and verify that they are equal, proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA △ B = {1, 4, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) △ A:\n\n(A △ B) △ A = {1, 4, 6, 7} △ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {2, 3, 6, 7}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B △ A:\n\nB △ A = {2, 3, 6, 7} △ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {1, 4, 6, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A △ (B △ A):\n\nA △ (B △ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4} △ {1, 4, 6, 7} = {2, 3, 6, 7}\n\nAs we can see, the symmetric difference of (A △ B) △ A and A △ (B △ A) are both equal to {2, 3, 6, 7}. This demonstrates that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative, as (A △ B) △ A = A △ (B △ A)."
