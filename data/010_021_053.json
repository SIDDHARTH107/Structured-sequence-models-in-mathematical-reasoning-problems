If $p, q$ are two critical points of $H$ and $M_{p,q}$ denotes the moduli space of (parametrized) J-holomorphic maps from a sphere with two marked points to $M$ with homology class $A \\in H_2(M, \\mathbb{Z})$ and asymptotic to $p$ and $q$ at the marked points, then show that the dimension of $M_{p,q}$ is given by the formula :\n\n$$\\text{dim }M_{p,q}= \\mu(p)-\\mu(q)+ n-\\text{dim }G_p -\\text{dim }G_q$$\n\nwhere $\\mu(p)$ is the Maslov index of the loop of Lagrangian subspaces associated to $p$, $n$ is the dimension of $M$, $G_p$ and $G_q$ are the isotropy groups of $p$ and $q$ respectively. Solve for the dimension of $M_{p, q}$ when $\\mu(p) = \\mu(q) = 1$, $n = 4$, $\\text{dim }G_p = \\text{dim }G_q = 1$, and $A = PD([C])$ where $C$ is an embedded sphere in $M$ with self-intersection number $1$.",
