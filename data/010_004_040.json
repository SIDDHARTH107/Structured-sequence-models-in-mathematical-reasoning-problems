Suppose that for every x in X, there exists an infinite n such that {U_1, U_2, ..., U_n} contains a neighbourhood of x. Prove that the intersection of all U_n is non-empty. \n\nFor example, if X is the interval [0,1], and U_n = (1/n, 1-1/n), then the intersection of all U_n is the singleton set {1}.",
    "message_2": "To prove that the intersection of all U_n is non-empty, we will use the method of contradiction. Suppose the intersection of all U_n is empty, i.e., ⋂(U_n) = ∅. \n\nNow, consider the collection of closed sets {F_n}, where F_n = X - U_n. Since U_n is open, F_n is closed for all n. Also, note that the union of all F_n is equal to X - ⋂(U_n) = X, since the intersection of all U_n is empty.\n\nBy the assumption, for every x in X, there exists an infinite n such that {U_1, U_2, ..., U_n} contains a neighborhood of x. This means that x is not in F_n for some n. Therefore, every x in X belongs to the union of all F_n.\n\nSince X is compact, by the finite intersection property, there exists a finite subcollection of {F_n} whose union covers X, i.e., X = F_n1 ∪ F_n2 ∪ ... ∪ F_nk for some finite indices n1, n2, ..., nk.\n\nNow, let N = max{n1, n2, ..., nk}. By the assumption, for every x in X, there exists an infinite n such that {U_1, U_2, ..., U_n} contains a neighborhood of x. In particular, this holds for N+1. So, for every x in X, there exists a neighborhood of x contained in {U_1, U_2, ..., U_N, U_(N+1)}.\n\nHowever, we know that X = F_n1 ∪ F_n2 ∪ ... ∪ F_nk, and since N is the maximum of these indices, it follows that X ⊆ F_1 ∪ F_2 ∪ ... ∪ F_N. This implies that X ⊆ F_(N+1), which means that U_(N+1) is empty, contradicting the assumption that U_(N+1) contains a neighborhood of every x in X.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that the intersection of all U_n is empty must be false. Hence, the intersection of all U_n is non-empty."
