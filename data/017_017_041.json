    "message_2": "A group of order 30 has the prime factorization 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. According to Sylow's theorems, we can analyze the possible number of subgroups of order 2 in a group of order 30.\n\nFor a subgroup of order 2, we are looking for elements of order 2 in the group. By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order 2) must divide the order of the group (30) and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n\nNow, let's see how these numbers help in determining the isomorphism type of the group. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, then it is normal in the group. In this case, the group could be isomorphic to a semidirect product of its Sylow 3-subgroup and Sylow 5-subgroup, which are of orders 3 and 5, respectively. This would give two possibilities: either the cyclic group of order 30 (Z_30) or the dihedral group of order 30 (D_30).\n\nIf there are more than one Sylow 2-subgroups, then the group cannot be isomorphic to Z_30 or D_30. In this case, the group could be isomorphic to a more complicated group, such as a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nIn summary, the possible number of subgroups of order 2 in a group of order 30 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. These numbers help in determining the isomorphism type of the group by narrowing down the possibilities based on the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and their normality in the group."
