    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to form the matrix A and the vector b:\n\nA = | 2  3 -1 |\n    | 4  2  1 |\n    | 2 -1  3 |\n\nb = | 1 |\n    | 7 |\n    | 4 |\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process where A is decomposed into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and the upper triangular matrix R:\n\n1. Find the orthogonal basis for the column space of A:\n\nu1 = a1 = (2, 4, 2)\nu2 = a2 - proj(u1, a2) = (3, 2, -1) - ((3, 2, -1) • (2, 4, 2)) / ||(2, 4, 2)||^2 * (2, 4, 2) = (3, 2, -1) - (1/2) * (2, 4, 2) = (2, 0, -2)\nu3 = a3 - proj(u1, a3) - proj(u2, a3) = (-1, 1, 3) - ((-1, 1, 3) • (2, 4, 2)) / ||(2, 4, 2)||^2 * (2, 4, 2) - ((-1, 1, 3) • (2, 0, -2)) / ||(2, 0, -2)||^2 * (2, 0, -2) = (-1, 1, 3) - (1/2) * (2, 4, 2) - (1/2) * (2, 0, -2) = (-1, -1, 3)\n\n2. Normalize the orthogonal basis to form the orthonormal basis:\n\nq1 = u1 / ||u1|| = (2, 4, 2) / ||(2, 4, 2)|| = (1/3, 2/3, 1/3)\nq2 = u2 / ||u2|| = (2, 0, -2) / ||(2, 0, -2)|| = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)\nq3 = u3 / ||u3|| = (-1, -1, 3) / ||(-1, -1, 3)|| = (-1/√11, -1/√11, 3/√11)\n\nNow, we can form the orthogonal matrix Q:\n\nQ = | 1/3     1/√2   -1/√11 |\n    | 2/3     0     -1/√11 |\n    | 1/3    -1/√2    3/√11 |\n\n3. Compute the upper triangular matrix R:\n\nR = Q^T * A\n\nR = | 6/3  2/3 -4/3 | = | 2  2/3 -4/3 |\n    | 0    2/√2  2/√2 |   | 0  1    1   |\n    | 0    0    11/√11|   | 0  0    √11 |\n\nNow, we have A = QR, and we can solve the system Rx = Q^T * b:\n\nQ^T * b = | 1/3  2/3  1/3 | * | 1 | = | 3 |\n          | 1/√2  0  -1/√2 |   | 7 |   | 5 |\n          |-1/√11 -1/√11 3/√11|   | 4 |   | 1 |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = (3, 5, 1):\n\nx = (3 - 2/3 * z) / 2\ny = (5 - z) / 1\nz = 1 / √11\n\nSolving for x, y, and z:\n\nz = 1 / √11 ≈ 0.30\ny = 5 - z ≈ 4.70\nx = (3 - 2/3 * z) / 2 ≈ 1.23\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is approximately:\n\nx ≈ 1.23\ny ≈ 4.70\nz ≈ 0.30"
