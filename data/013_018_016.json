    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nIn a signaling game, player 1 has two types: Type A occurs with probability 0.4 and type B occurs with probability 0.6. Player 2 observes player 1's type and receives a signal that is either accurate with probability 0.8 or inaccurate with probability 0.2. If player 2 receives an accurate signal, they pay player 1 $10 if player 1 is of type A; if player 1 is of type B, player 2 pays them $5. If player 2 receives an inaccurate signal, they pay player 1 $5 regardless of player 1's type. What is player 1's optimal strategy?",
    "message_2": "To find player 1's optimal strategy, we need to calculate the expected payoff for player 2 for each possible strategy of player 1. Let's first calculate the probabilities of each possible outcome.\n\n1. Player 1 is type A, and player 2 receives an accurate signal:\nProbability = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32\n\n2. Player 1 is type A, and player 2 receives an inaccurate signal:\nProbability = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08\n\n3. Player 1 is type B, and player 2 receives an accurate signal:\nProbability = 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.48\n\n4. Player 1 is type B, and player 2 receives an inaccurate signal:\nProbability = 0.6 * 0.2 = 0.12\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected payoff for player 2 for each possible outcome.\n\n1. Player 1 is type A, and player 2 receives an accurate signal:\nPayoff = $10\n\n2. Player 1 is type A, and player 2 receives an inaccurate signal:\nPayoff = $5\n\n3. Player 1 is type B, and player 2 receives an accurate signal:\nPayoff = $5\n\n4. Player 1 is type B, and player 2 receives an inaccurate signal:\nPayoff = $5\n\nFinally, let's calculate the expected payoff for player 1 for each possible strategy.\n\nStrategy 1: Always claim to be type A\nExpected payoff = (0.32 * $10) + (0.08 * $5) + (0.48 * $0) + (0.12 * $5) = $4.60\n\nStrategy 2: Always claim to be type B\nExpected payoff = (0.32 * $0) + (0.08 * $5) + (0.48 * $5) + (0.12 * $5) = $3.40\n\nSince the expected payoff for player 1 is higher when they always claim to be type A ($4.60), player 1's optimal strategy is to always claim to be type A."
