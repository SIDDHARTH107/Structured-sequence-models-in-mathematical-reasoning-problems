    "message_1": "A company needs to ship 7 packages of different weights. The maximum weight that can be loaded onto the truck is 50 kg. Determine the number of ways the packages can be loaded onto the truck if the weight of the heaviest package must not exceed 25 kg.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the weights of the packages as p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, and p7. We are given that the heaviest package must not exceed 25 kg, and the total weight of the packages loaded onto the truck must not exceed 50 kg.\n\nWe will use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to solve this problem. First, let's find the total number of ways to load the packages without any restrictions. Since there are 7 packages, there are 2^7 = 128 ways to load the packages (each package can either be loaded or not loaded).\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways that violate the given conditions. There are two cases:\n\n1. The heaviest package weighs more than 25 kg.\n2. The total weight of the packages loaded onto the truck exceeds 50 kg.\n\nCase 1: If the heaviest package weighs more than 25 kg, it cannot be loaded onto the truck. So, we only have 6 packages left to load. There are 2^6 = 64 ways to load these 6 packages.\n\nCase 2: If the total weight of the packages loaded onto the truck exceeds 50 kg, we need to find the number of ways that this can happen. Since the heaviest package must not exceed 25 kg, the only way for the total weight to exceed 50 kg is if at least 3 packages are loaded onto the truck. Let's consider the number of ways to choose 3 packages out of 7, which is given by the combination formula: C(7,3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!) = 35.\n\nHowever, we have double-counted the cases where both conditions are violated (i.e., the heaviest package weighs more than 25 kg, and the total weight of the packages loaded onto the truck exceeds 50 kg). Since the heaviest package cannot be loaded onto the truck in this case, we only have 6 packages left to load, and we need to choose at least 3 of them. The number of ways to do this is C(6,3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the number of ways to load the packages without violating the given conditions:\n\nTotal ways - (Case 1 + Case 2) + Both cases = 128 - (64 + 35) + 20 = 49 ways.\n\nSo, there are 49 ways to load the packages onto the truck without violating the given conditions."
