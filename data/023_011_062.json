    "message_2": "To determine the frequency domain representation of a square wave using the Fourier transform, we need to use the Fourier series representation of the square wave. The Fourier series of a square wave with amplitude A, frequency f, and period T is given by:\n\nx(t) = A * Σ [ (1/n) * sin(2πnft) ] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nwhere n is an odd integer, and the summation goes to infinity. In this case, the amplitude A is 5 volts, and the frequency f is 50 Hz.\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of the given square wave:\n\nx(t) = 5 * Σ [ (1/n) * sin(2πn(50)t) ] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nThe frequency domain representation of the wave can be obtained by taking the Fourier transform of x(t). Since the Fourier series is already in the frequency domain, we can directly write the frequency domain representation as:\n\nX(f) = 5 * Σ [ (1/n) * δ(f - n*50) ] for n = 1, 3, 5, ...\n\nwhere δ(f) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nThis representation shows that the square wave consists of a series of odd harmonics (multiples) of the fundamental frequency (50 Hz) with amplitudes decreasing as 1/n."
