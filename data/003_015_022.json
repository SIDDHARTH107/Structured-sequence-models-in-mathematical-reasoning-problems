    "message_2": "The given function is f(x) = 5sin(3x).\n\nTo find the amplitude, we look at the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, the amplitude is 5.\n\nTo find the period, we need to determine how long it takes for the function to complete one full cycle. The general formula for the period of a sine function is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nwhere B is the coefficient of x inside the sine function. In this case, B = 3.\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |3| = (2π) / 3\n\nSo, the amplitude is 5 and the period is (2π) / 3."
