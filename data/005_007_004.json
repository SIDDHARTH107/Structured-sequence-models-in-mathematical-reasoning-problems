    "message_1": "Suppose you want to investigate the relationship between the number of hours a student spends studying per week and their GPA. You collected data from 20 students and found that the correlation coefficient between the two variables is 0.75. What can you conclude about the relationship between the number of hours spent studying and GPA?",
    "message_2": "A correlation coefficient of 0.75 indicates a strong positive relationship between the number of hours a student spends studying per week and their GPA. This means that as the number of hours spent studying increases, the GPA tends to increase as well. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While there is a strong association between the two variables, we cannot conclude that studying more hours directly causes an increase in GPA. There may be other factors involved, and further research would be needed to establish a causal relationship."
