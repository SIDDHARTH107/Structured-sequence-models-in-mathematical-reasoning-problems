    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the concentration of C after 100 seconds of the reaction. We can use the given rate equation and the initial concentrations of A and B to find the rate of the reaction.\n\nRate = k[A][B]\n\nGiven:\nInitial concentration of A = [A]₀ = 0.05 M\nInitial concentration of B = [B]₀ = 0.02 M\nRate constant k = 0.0053 M⁻²s⁻¹\n\nFirst, let's find the rate of the reaction:\n\nRate = (0.0053 M⁻²s⁻¹)(0.05 M)(0.02 M) = 5.3 x 10⁻⁶ M/s\n\nNow, we need to find the concentration of C after 100 seconds. Since the rate of the reaction is constant, we can use the following equation:\n\n[C] = Rate × time\n\n[C] = (5.3 x 10⁻⁶ M/s)(100 s) = 5.3 x 10⁻⁴ M\n\nSo, the concentration of C after 100 seconds of the reaction is 5.3 x 10⁻⁴ M."
