    "message_1": "A thin rod of length 0.5 meters initially has a uniform temperature distribution of 30°C along its length. The ends of the rod are held at 85°C and 60°C. Using the Fourier transform, find the temperature distribution along the rod at time t=120 seconds if the thermal diffusivity of the material is 10^-4 m^2/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the given boundary conditions and initial temperature distribution. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature distribution along the rod, α is the thermal diffusivity, x is the position along the rod, and t is the time.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\nT(0,t) = 85°C\nT(0.5,t) = 60°C\n\nThe initial temperature distribution is:\nT(x,0) = 30°C\n\nTo solve the heat equation with these boundary conditions, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = α T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we get:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side is only a function of time and the right side is only a function of position, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ²:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n∂T(t)/∂t = -αλ²T(t)\n∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²X(x)\n\nThe general solution for the time-dependent equation is:\n\nT(t) = A e^(-αλ²t)\n\nThe general solution for the position-dependent equation is:\n\nX(x) = B cos(λx) + C sin(λx)\n\nNow we apply the boundary conditions to find the coefficients A, B, and C:\n\nT(0,t) = X(0)T(t) = 85 => X(0) = 85/A\nT(0.5,t) = X(0.5)T(t) = 60 => X(0.5) = 60/A\n\nX(0) = B cos(0) + C sin(0) = B => B = 85/A\nX(0.5) = (85/A) cos(λ(0.5)) + C sin(λ(0.5)) = 60/A\n\nNow we have a system of equations for B and C:\n\nB = 85/A\n(85/A) cos(λ(0.5)) + C sin(λ(0.5)) = 60/A\n\nTo find the eigenvalues λ, we can use the method of Fourier sine series:\n\nT(x,0) = 30 = (85/A) cos(λx) + C sin(λx)\n\nSince the initial temperature distribution is given, we can expand this function as a Fourier sine series:\n\n30 = Σ [(2/L) ∫(T(x,0) sin(nπx/L) dx] sin(nπx/L)\n\nwhere L is the length of the rod (0.5 meters) and the integral is taken over the interval [0, L]. We can find the coefficients by integrating:\n\na_n = (2/L) ∫(T(x,0) sin(nπx/L) dx) = (2/0.5) ∫(30 sin(nπx/0.5) dx) from 0 to 0.5\n\na_n = 4 ∫(30 sin(nπx/0.5) dx) from 0 to 0.5\na_n = 4[-(0.5/nπ) cos(nπx/0.5)] from 0 to 0.5\na_n = 4[-(0.5/nπ) cos(nπ)] - 4[-(0.5/nπ) cos(0)]\na_n = 2/nπ (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow we have the Fourier sine series representation of the initial temperature distribution:\n\nT(x,0) = Σ [a_n sin(nπx/L)]\n\nWe can now find the temperature distribution T(x,t) by substituting the Fourier sine series representation into the general solution:\n\nT(x,t) = Σ [a_n e^(-α(nπ/L)²t) sin(nπx/L)]\n\nPlugging in the values for α, L, and a_n, we get:\n\nT(x,t) = Σ [(2/nπ (1 - (-1)^n)) e^(-10^-4(nπ/0.5)²t) sin(nπx/0.5)]\n\nNow we can find the temperature distribution along the rod at t=120 seconds:\n\nT(x,120) = Σ [(2/nπ (1 - (-1)^n)) e^(-10^-4(nπ/0.5)²(120)) sin(nπx/0.5)]\n\nThis is the temperature distribution along the rod at t=120 seconds. To find the temperature at specific points along the rod, you can plug in the x-values and sum the series. Note that the series converges quickly, so you may only need to consider a few terms to get an accurate result."
