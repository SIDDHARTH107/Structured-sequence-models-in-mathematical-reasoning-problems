    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}. \nFind (A × B) ∩ {(x, y) | x ∈ A ∩ B, y ∈ B} and compare it with (B × A) ∩ {(x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ A ∩ B}. Is the result the same or different? Explain why.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\nB × A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find A ∩ B:\n\nA ∩ B = {2}\n\nNow, let's find the sets {(x, y) | x ∈ A ∩ B, y ∈ B} and {(x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ A ∩ B}:\n\n{(x, y) | x ∈ A ∩ B, y ∈ B} = {(2, 2), (2, 3)}\n{(x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ A ∩ B} = {(1, 2), (2, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of these sets with A × B and B × A:\n\n(A × B) ∩ {(x, y) | x ∈ A ∩ B, y ∈ B} = {(2, 2), (2, 3)} ∩ {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)} = {(2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\n(B × A) ∩ {(x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ A ∩ B} = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)} ∩ {(1, 2), (2, 2)} = {(2, 2)}\n\nThe result is different. (A × B) ∩ {(x, y) | x ∈ A ∩ B, y ∈ B} = {(2, 2), (2, 3)} while (B × A) ∩ {(x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ A ∩ B} = {(2, 2)}. \n\nThe reason for the difference is that the order of the elements in the Cartesian product matters. In the first case, we are looking for pairs where the first element is in the intersection of A and B, and the second element is in B. In the second case, we are looking for pairs where the first element is in A, and the second element is in the intersection of A and B. Since the sets A and B are different, the conditions for the pairs in the two cases are different, leading to different results."
