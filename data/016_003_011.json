    "message_2": "To determine if a complex number c = a + bi is part of the Mandelbrot set, we need to iterate the function f(z) = z^2 + c, where z starts at 0 and is updated with the result of the function in each iteration. If the magnitude of z (|z|) remains bounded (i.e., does not go to infinity) after a certain number of iterations, then the complex number c is considered to be part of the Mandelbrot set.\n\nIn this case, you have specified a precision of 1000 iterations for each point in the complex plane. This means that the maximum number of iterations required to determine if a complex number c is part of the Mandelbrot set is 1000 iterations. If after 1000 iterations, the magnitude of z remains bounded, then c is considered to be part of the Mandelbrot set. If the magnitude of z becomes unbounded (goes to infinity) before reaching 1000 iterations, then c is not part of the Mandelbrot set."
