    "message_2": "To find the position of the particle at t=3 seconds, we need to determine the acceleration, and then integrate it twice to find the position function.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the particle to kilograms: 200 grams = 0.2 kg.\n\nNext, we can use Newton's second law, F = ma, to find the acceleration:\n\na(x) = F(x) / m = (8x - 3) / 0.2\n\nNow, we need to integrate the acceleration function to find the velocity function. Let's integrate a(x) with respect to x:\n\nv(x) = ∫a(x) dx = ∫((8x - 3) / 0.2) dx = 40x^2 - 15x + C1\n\nAt t=0, the initial velocity is given as 15 m/s. To find the constant of integration C1, we need to find the initial position x(0). Since the problem doesn't specify the initial position, we can assume it to be x(0) = 0. Therefore, v(0) = 15:\n\n15 = 40(0)^2 - 15(0) + C1\nC1 = 15\n\nSo, the velocity function is:\n\nv(x) = 40x^2 - 15x + 15\n\nNow, we need to integrate the velocity function to find the position function:\n\nx(t) = ∫v(x) dx = ∫(40x^2 - 15x + 15) dx = (40/3)x^3 - (15/2)x^2 + 15x + C2\n\nSince we assumed the initial position x(0) = 0:\n\n0 = (40/3)(0)^3 - (15/2)(0)^2 + 15(0) + C2\nC2 = 0\n\nSo, the position function is:\n\nx(t) = (40/3)x^3 - (15/2)x^2 + 15x\n\nFinally, we can find the position of the particle at t=3 seconds:\n\nx(3) = (40/3)(3)^3 - (15/2)(3)^2 + 15(3)\nx(3) = (40/3)(27) - (15/2)(9) + 45\nx(3) = 360 - 67.5 + 45\nx(3) = 337.5\n\nThe particle's position at t=3 seconds is x = 337.5 meters."
