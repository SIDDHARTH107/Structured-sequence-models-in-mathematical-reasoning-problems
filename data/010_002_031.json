    "message_2": "In the given topological space X = {1, 2, 3} and T = {{}, {1, 2, 3}}, we have only two open sets: the empty set and the set containing all elements of X.\n\nA sequence (x_n) converges to a point x in a topological space if for every open set U containing x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n ≥ N, x_n ∈ U.\n\nNow, let's consider the sequence (1, 1, 1, ...). We want to determine if it converges to 2 or 3 in the topology T.\n\nSince the only non-empty open set in T is {1, 2, 3}, it contains both 2 and 3. However, the sequence (1, 1, 1, ...) consists only of the element 1, and no matter how far we go in the sequence, we will never find 2 or 3.\n\nThus, the sequence (1, 1, 1, ...) does not converge to 2 or 3 in the topology T."
