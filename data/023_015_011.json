    "message_1": "A signal is defined by f(t) = 2cos(4πt) + 4sin(8πt) + 5cos(12πt). Using the Fourier transform, determine the amplitude and frequency of each component wave in this signal.",
    "message_2": "The given signal f(t) is already represented as a sum of sinusoidal functions, so we don't need to apply the Fourier transform to find the amplitude and frequency of each component wave. We can directly read the amplitudes and frequencies from the given expression.\n\nThe signal f(t) is composed of three component waves:\n\n1. The first component wave is a cosine wave with amplitude A1 = 2 and angular frequency ω1 = 4π. The frequency is given by f1 = ω1 / (2π) = 4π / (2π) = 2 Hz.\n\n2. The second component wave is a sine wave with amplitude A2 = 4 and angular frequency ω2 = 8π. The frequency is given by f2 = ω2 / (2π) = 8π / (2π) = 4 Hz.\n\n3. The third component wave is a cosine wave with amplitude A3 = 5 and angular frequency ω3 = 12π. The frequency is given by f3 = ω3 / (2π) = 12π / (2π) = 6 Hz.\n\nSo, the amplitudes and frequencies of the component waves are:\n\n1. Amplitude A1 = 2, Frequency f1 = 2 Hz\n2. Amplitude A2 = 4, Frequency f2 = 4 Hz\n3. Amplitude A3 = 5, Frequency f3 = 6 Hz"
