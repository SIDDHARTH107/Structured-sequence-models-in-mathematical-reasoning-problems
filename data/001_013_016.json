    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(x+4) - √(x) = 1, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate one of the radicals.\nAdd √(x) to both sides of the equation:\n\n√(x+4) = √(x) + 1\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation.\n(√(x+4))^2 = (√(x) + 1)^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx + 4 = x + 2√(x) + 1\n\nStep 3: Isolate the remaining radical.\nSubtract x and 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n3 = 2√(x)\n\nStep 4: Solve for x.\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n3/2 = √(x)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(3/2)^2 = x\n\nx = 9/4\n\nSo the solution to the radical equation √(x+4) - √(x) = 1 is x = 9/4."
