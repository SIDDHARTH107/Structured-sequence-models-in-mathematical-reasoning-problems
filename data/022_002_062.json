    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Schwarz-Christoffel formula, which states that a conformal map from the upper half-plane to a polygon can be expressed as:\n\n$$f(z) = A + C \\int_{z_0}^z (\\zeta - z_1)^{\\alpha_1 - 1}(\\zeta - z_2)^{\\alpha_2 - 1} \\cdots (\\zeta - z_n)^{\\alpha_n - 1} d\\zeta$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $C$ are constants, $z_0, z_1, \\ldots, z_n$ are the prevertices in the upper half-plane, and $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, \\alpha_n$ are the angles of the polygon divided by $\\pi$. In our case, the polygon is a unit disk, so we have three prevertices: $z_1 = 0$, $z_2 = i$, and $z_3 = \\infty$. The angles are $\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2 = \\alpha_3 = 1$.\n\nUsing the Schwarz-Christoffel formula, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = A + C \\int_{z_0}^z (\\zeta - 0)^{0}(\\zeta - i)^{0} d\\zeta = A + C \\int_{z_0}^z d\\zeta$$\n\nNow, we use the given conditions $f(0) = i$ and $f(i) = 0$ to find the constants $A$ and $C$. When $z = 0$, we have:\n\n$$i = A + C \\int_{z_0}^0 d\\zeta \\Rightarrow A = i - Cz_0$$\n\nWhen $z = i$, we have:\n\n$$0 = A + C \\int_{z_0}^i d\\zeta \\Rightarrow 0 = i - Cz_0 + Ci - Cz_0i$$\n\nSolving for $A$ and $C$, we get $A = i$ and $C = -i$. Thus, the conformal map is:\n\n$$f(z) = i - i \\int_{z_0}^z d\\zeta$$\n\nNow, we find the image of the line $y = 1$ and the circle $|z| = 2$ in the upper half-plane.\n\n1. For the line $y = 1$, we have $z = x + i$. The conformal map is:\n\n$$f(z) = i - i \\int_{z_0}^{x+i} d\\zeta = i - i(x + i - z_0) = (1 - x) + (1 - z_0)i$$\n\nThe image of the line $y = 1$ is a line segment in the unit disk from $(1 - z_0)i$ to $(1 - z_0)i + 1$.\n\n2. For the circle $|z| = 2$, we have $z = 2e^{i\\theta}$ with $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$. The conformal map is:\n\n$$f(z) = i - i \\int_{z_0}^{2e^{i\\theta}} d\\zeta = i - i(2e^{i\\theta} - z_0) = (1 - 2\\cos\\theta) + (1 - 2\\sin\\theta - z_0)i$$\n\nThe image of the circle $|z| = 2$ is a curve in the unit disk parameterized by $(1 - 2\\cos\\theta) + (1 - 2\\sin\\theta - z_0)i$ with $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$."
