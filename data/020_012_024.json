    "message_1": "A cable company is trying to lay a fiber-optic cable from headquarters to a remote village. The company needs to determine the best route that minimized the cost of digging a trench through the mountainous terrain. The cost of digging per foot of soil is $5, and the company has a budget of $50,000. Determine the length of the shortest route the company can use to lay the fiber-optic cable.",
    "message_2": "To determine the shortest route the company can use to lay the fiber-optic cable, we need to find the maximum length of cable they can lay within their budget.\n\nThe cost of digging per foot of soil is $5, and the company has a budget of $50,000. We can set up an equation to find the maximum length of cable they can lay:\n\nCost of digging per foot * Length of cable = Budget\n5 * Length of cable = 50,000\n\nNow, we can solve for the length of cable:\n\nLength of cable = 50,000 / 5\nLength of cable = 10,000 feet\n\nSo, the shortest route the company can use to lay the fiber-optic cable is 10,000 feet."
