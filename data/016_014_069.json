    "message_1": "A mathematical problem related to the self-similarity of the Lévy C curve could be:\n\nGiven a Lévy C curve with an initial side length of 10 cm, find the length of the curve after the 4th iteration, assuming that each new iteration reduces the length of the curve by one-third.",
    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-similar fractal, which means that each iteration is made up of smaller copies of the previous iteration. In this case, each iteration reduces the length of the curve by one-third.\n\nTo find the length of the curve after the 4th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength of curve after n iterations = Initial side length * (4^n)\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the given problem, the initial side length is 10 cm and we want to find the length after the 4th iteration (n = 4).\n\nLength of curve after 4 iterations = 10 * (4^4)\n\nLength of curve after 4 iterations = 10 * (256)\n\nLength of curve after 4 iterations = 2560 cm\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve after the 4th iteration is 2560 cm."
