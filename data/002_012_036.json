    "message_1": "A parallelogram has a height of 8 cm and a base of 12 cm. What is the area of the parallelogram? (Answer: 96 cm²)",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a parallelogram, we use the formula:\n\nArea = base × height\n\nIn this case, the base is 12 cm and the height is 8 cm. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = 12 cm × 8 cm = 96 cm²\n\nThe area of the parallelogram is 96 cm²."
