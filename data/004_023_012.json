    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting $y = x^2$ equal to $y = 2x - x^2$:\n\n$x^2 = 2x - x^2$\n\nAdding $x^2$ to both sides, we get:\n\n$2x^2 = 2x$\n\nDividing both sides by $2x$ (assuming $x \\neq 0$), we get:\n\n$x = 1$\n\nSo, the two curves intersect at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. Now, we can find the area enclosed between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval $[0, 1]$:\n\n$\\int_0^1 [(2x - x^2) - x^2] dx$\n\nSimplifying the integrand, we get:\n\n$\\int_0^1 (2x - 2x^2) dx$\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n$\\int_0^1 (2x - 2x^2) dx = [x^2 - \\frac{2}{3}x^3]_0^1$\n\nEvaluating the antiderivative at the bounds of integration, we get:\n\n$[1^2 - \\frac{2}{3}(1)^3] - [0^2 - \\frac{2}{3}(0)^3] = [1 - \\frac{2}{3}] - [0] = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the curves $y = x^2$ and $y = 2x - x^2$ in the domain $0 \\leq x \\leq 2$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ square units."
