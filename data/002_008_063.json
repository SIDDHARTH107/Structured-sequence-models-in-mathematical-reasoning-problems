    "message_1": "A cone has a base radius of 4 cm and a height of 10 cm. Find its volume.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, h is the height, and π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the radius r is 4 cm and the height h is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(4^2)(10)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(16)(10)\n\nVolume = (1/3)(160π)\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(160 × 3.14159)\n\nVolume ≈ (1/3)(502.6544)\n\nVolume ≈ 167.55147 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 167.55 cm³."
