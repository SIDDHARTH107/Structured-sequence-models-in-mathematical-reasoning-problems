    "message_2": "In a round-robin tournament with 7 players, each player has to play against every other player exactly once. To calculate the total number of games, we can use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of players, k is the number of players in each game (which is 2 for a one-on-one game), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 7 and k = 2, so we have:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!)\n= 7! / (2!5!)\n= (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n= (7 × 6) / (2 × 1)\n= 42 / 2\n= 21\n\nSo, there must be 21 games played in a round-robin tournament with 7 players."
