    "message_2": "First, we need to find the quartiles of the data. To do this, we need to sort the data in ascending order:\n\n$3500, $3600, $3700, $3800, $3800, $3800, $3900, $3900, $4000, $4000, $4200, $9800\n\nNow, we can find the quartiles:\n\nQ1 (first quartile) is the median of the first half of the data:\n($3500 + $3700) / 2 = $3600\n\nQ3 (third quartile) is the median of the second half of the data:\n($4000 + $4200) / 2 = $4100\n\nNow, we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = $4100 - $3600 = $500\n\nNext, we can find the lower and upper bounds for outliers using the 1.5×IQR rule:\n\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5×IQR = $3600 - 1.5×$500 = $2850\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5×IQR = $4100 + 1.5×$500 = $4850\n\nNow, we can identify the outlier(s) by checking which data points fall outside the lower and upper bounds:\n\n$3500, $3600, $3700, $3800, $3800, $3800, $3900, $3900, $4000, $4000, $4200, $9800\n\nThe only data point that falls outside the bounds is $9800, which is greater than the upper bound of $4850. Therefore, the outlier in this data set is $9800."
