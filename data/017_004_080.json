    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 25, which is a prime power (5^2), we can use the Sylow Theorems to analyze the structure of G.\n\nBy the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5 divides the order of G, which is 25, so n_5 divides 25.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe possible divisors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25. The only one that satisfies both conditions is n_5 = 1. This means that there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup in G, which we will call H.\n\nSince H is the only Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be normal in G. The order of H is 5, which is prime, so H is a cyclic group. Let a be a generator of H, so H = ⟨a⟩ and a^5 = e (the identity element in G).\n\nNow, let's consider an element b in G that is not in H. Since the order of G is 25, there are 24 elements other than the identity element. H has 4 elements other than the identity, so there are 20 elements in G that are not in H. We can form a new subgroup K = ⟨b⟩. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of H is 5, the order of K must also be 5 (by Lagrange's theorem).\n\nNow, let's consider the product of elements from H and K. For any h in H and k in K, we have:\n\n(hk)(hk)^(-1) = h(kk^(-1))h^(-1) = heh^(-1) = hh^(-1) = e\n\nThis shows that hk = kh for all h ∈ H and k ∈ K. Therefore, the elements of H and K commute.\n\nNow, let's consider the set HK = {hk | h ∈ H, k ∈ K}. We claim that HK is a subgroup of G. To show this, we need to verify the following properties:\n\n1. Closure: For any h1, h2 ∈ H and k1, k2 ∈ K, we have (h1k1)(h2k2) = h1(k1h2)k2 = h1(h2k1)k2 = (h1h2)(k1k2) ∈ HK, since H and K commute.\n\n2. Identity: Since e is the identity element in both H and K, we have ee = e ∈ HK.\n\n3. Inverses: For any h ∈ H and k ∈ K, we have (hk)^(-1) = k^(-1)h^(-1) ∈ HK, since k^(-1) ∈ K and h^(-1) ∈ H.\n\nTherefore, HK is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the elements of H and K commute, we have |HK| = |H||K| = 5 * 5 = 25. Since |HK| = |G|, we have HK = G.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1. If b^5 = e, then K is a cyclic group of order 5, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, both of which are cyclic groups of order 5.\n\n2. If b^5 ≠ e, then the order of b must be 25 (since it must divide the order of G). In this case, G is a cyclic group generated by b, since every element in G can be written as a power of b.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
