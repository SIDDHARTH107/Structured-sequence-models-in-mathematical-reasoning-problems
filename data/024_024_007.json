Calculate the Cartan connection $\\omega$ on $M$ such that $\\mathrm{d}\\omega=0$, using the normal coordinates at the point $p\\in M$ given by $(x,y,z)=(0,0,0)$. The Riemannian metric $g$ at $p$ is given by $g_{ij}(0)=\\mathrm{diag}(1,2,3)$ in normal coordinates.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Cartan connection $\\omega$ on the manifold $M$, we first need to find the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$, which are given by the following formula:\n\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} (\\partial_i g_{lj} + \\partial_j g_{li} - \\partial_l g_{ij}).$$\n\nSince we are working in normal coordinates at the point $p = (0,0,0)$, the Christoffel symbols vanish at $p$. This is because the partial derivatives of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ with respect to the coordinates are zero at $p$:\n\n$$\\partial_i g_{lj}(0) = \\partial_j g_{li}(0) = \\partial_l g_{ij}(0) = 0.$$\n\nNow, we can define the Cartan connection $\\omega$ as a 1-form with values in the Lie algebra of the orthogonal group $O(3)$. In terms of the Christoffel symbols, the Cartan connection can be written as:\n\n$$\\omega^k_{\\phantom{k}i} = \\Gamma^k_{ij} dx^j.$$\n\nSince the Christoffel symbols vanish at $p$, the Cartan connection $\\omega$ also vanishes at $p$:\n\n$$\\omega^k_{\\phantom{k}i}(0) = 0.$$\n\nFinally, we are asked to find the Cartan connection $\\omega$ such that $\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0$. Since $\\omega$ vanishes at $p$, it is automatically closed:\n\n$$\\mathrm{d}\\omega(0) = 0.$$\n\nThus, the Cartan connection $\\omega$ on the manifold $M$ is given by:\n\n$$\\omega^k_{\\phantom{k}i} = \\Gamma^k_{ij} dx^j = 0.$$"
