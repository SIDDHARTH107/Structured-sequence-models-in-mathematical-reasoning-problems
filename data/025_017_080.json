    "message_2": "The given equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ defines a smooth quadric surface in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. This is because the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z are:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 2y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 2z$\n\nAt any point $(x, y, z)$ on the surface, at least one of the coordinates is non-zero (since the equation is homogeneous). Therefore, the gradient of the equation is non-zero at every point on the surface, which implies that the surface is smooth.\n\nSince the surface is smooth, it has no singularities. Therefore, the minimal resolution of singularities of X is X itself."
