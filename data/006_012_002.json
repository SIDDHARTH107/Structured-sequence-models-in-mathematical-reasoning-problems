    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a burglary occurring in a specific neighborhood, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of successful outcomes is the number of burglaries reported (10), and the total number of possible outcomes is the number of houses in the neighborhood (200).\n\nProbability = 10 / 200\n\nProbability = 0.05\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in this specific neighborhood is 0.05 or 5%."
