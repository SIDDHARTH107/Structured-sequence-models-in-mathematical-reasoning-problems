    "message_1": "Consider the statement \"It will rain today.\" Let's define the propositional variable p to represent this statement. Using temporal logic, write an expression for the statement \"It will not rain today, but it will rain tomorrow.\" using p and the logical operators $\\neg$ (negation), $\\land$ (conjunction), and $\\rightarrow$ (implication).",
    "message_2": "Using temporal logic, we can represent the statement \"It will not rain today, but it will rain tomorrow\" as:\n\n$(\\neg p) \\land (\\bigcirc p)$\n\nHere, $\\neg p$ represents \"It will not rain today\" and $\\bigcirc p$ represents \"It will rain tomorrow\". The $\\land$ operator is used to combine these two statements."
