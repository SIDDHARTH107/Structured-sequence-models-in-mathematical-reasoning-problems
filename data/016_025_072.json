    "message_2": "A Sierpinski sieve of order 5 is a fractal pattern that results from applying the Sierpinski triangle algorithm five times. The total number of filled triangles in a Sierpinski sieve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal filled triangles = (3^n - 1) / 2\n\nwhere n is the order of the Sierpinski sieve.\n\nFor a Sierpinski sieve of order 5:\n\nTotal filled triangles = (3^5 - 1) / 2\nTotal filled triangles = (243 - 1) / 2\nTotal filled triangles = 242 / 2\nTotal filled triangles = 121\n\nSo, there are 121 filled triangles in a Sierpinski sieve of order 5."
