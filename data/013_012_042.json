Both firms know each other’s cost functions. What is the equilibrium output levels and profits for both firms in this Stackelberg competition? Assume that the market demand is given by Q = 16 – P, where Q is the total output and P is the price of the product.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the inverse demand function.\n2. Calculate the reaction function for firm B.\n3. Find the optimal output for firm A.\n4. Calculate the optimal output for firm B.\n5. Determine the equilibrium price.\n6. Calculate the profits for both firms.\n\nStep 1: Inverse demand function\nThe market demand is given by Q = 16 - P. We can rewrite this as P = 16 - Q, where Q = QA + QB.\n\nStep 2: Reaction function for firm B\nFirm B's profit function is given by πB = P * QB - CB(QB). Substituting the inverse demand function and the cost function, we get:\n\nπB = (16 - QA - QB) * QB - 3QB\n\nTo find the reaction function, we differentiate the profit function with respect to QB and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπB/dQB = 16 - QA - 2QB - 3 = 0\n\nSolving for QB, we get the reaction function for firm B:\n\nQB = (13 - QA) / 2\n\nStep 3: Optimal output for firm A\nFirm A's profit function is given by πA = P * QA - CA(QA). Substituting the inverse demand function, firm B's reaction function, and the cost function, we get:\n\nπA = (16 - QA - (13 - QA) / 2) * QA - 2QA\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nπA = (19 - 3QA / 2) * QA - 2QA\n\nTo find the optimal output for firm A, we differentiate the profit function with respect to QA and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπA/dQA = 19 - 3QA - 4 = 0\n\nSolving for QA, we get:\n\nQA = 5\n\nStep 4: Optimal output for firm B\nSubstitute the optimal output for firm A into firm B's reaction function:\n\nQB = (13 - 5) / 2 = 4\n\nStep 5: Equilibrium price\nSubstitute the optimal output levels into the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 16 - (QA + QB) = 16 - (5 + 4) = 7\n\nStep 6: Profits for both firms\nCalculate the profits for both firms using their respective profit functions:\n\nπA = (7 * 5) - 2 * 5 = 35 - 10 = 25\nπB = (7 * 4) - 3 * 4 = 28 - 12 = 16\n\nIn this Stackelberg competition, the equilibrium output levels are QA = 5 and QB = 4, the equilibrium price is P = 7, and the profits are πA = 25 and πB = 16."
