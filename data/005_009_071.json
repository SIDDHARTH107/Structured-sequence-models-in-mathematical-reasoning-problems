Calculate the median height of Group A and Group B, and use a non-parametric test to determine whether there is a significant difference in the median heights of the two groups. The heights of Group A are 165, 170, 162, 168, 173, and 169 cm, while the heights of Group B are 162, 173, 156, 166, 160, 172, and 171 cm. Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the median height for both groups.\n\nGroup A: 162, 165, 168, 169, 170, 173\nMedian height of Group A = (168 + 169) / 2 = 168.5 cm\n\nGroup B: 156, 160, 162, 166, 171, 172, 173\nMedian height of Group B = 166 cm\n\nSince the data does not follow a normal distribution, we will use a non-parametric test called the Mann-Whitney U test to determine if there is a significant difference in the median heights of the two groups.\n\nFirst, we need to rank the combined data from both groups:\n\n1. 156 (B)\n2. 160 (B)\n3. 162 (A)\n4. 162 (B)\n5. 165 (A)\n6. 166 (B)\n7. 168 (A)\n8. 169 (A)\n9. 170 (A)\n10. 171 (B)\n11. 172 (B)\n12. 173 (A)\n13. 173 (B)\n\nNow, we will calculate the sum of the ranks for each group:\n\nSum of ranks for Group A = 3 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 12 = 44\nSum of ranks for Group B = 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 11 + 13 = 47\n\nNext, we will calculate the Mann-Whitney U value for each group:\n\nU_A = n_A * n_B + (n_A * (n_A + 1)) / 2 - R_A\nU_B = n_A * n_B + (n_B * (n_B + 1)) / 2 - R_B\n\nWhere n_A and n_B are the number of observations in Group A and Group B, respectively, and R_A and R_B are the sum of ranks for Group A and Group B, respectively.\n\nU_A = 6 * 7 + (6 * (6 + 1)) / 2 - 44 = 42 - 44 = -2\nU_B = 6 * 7 + (7 * (7 + 1)) / 2 - 47 = 42 - 47 = -5\n\nSince U_A and U_B are negative, we will use the smaller absolute value, which is 2. Now, we will compare this value to the critical value for the Mann-Whitney U test at a significance level of 0.05. For sample sizes of 6 and 7, the critical value is 5.\n\nSince our calculated U value (2) is less than the critical value (5), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the median heights of the two groups at a significance level of 0.05."
