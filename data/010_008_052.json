    "message_2": "To determine the number of faces of K that are not edges, we need to consider the possible combinations of vertices that form faces with more than two vertices. In this case, we have 4 vertices, so the only possible faces with more than two vertices are triangles (3 vertices) and tetrahedra (4 vertices).\n\nLet's first consider the triangles. There are 4 choose 3 (4C3) ways to pick 3 vertices from the 4 vertices, which is equal to 4. However, we need to make sure that these triangles are formed by the edges in the 1-skeleton. The possible triangles are:\n\n1. {v1, v2, v3} - formed by edges {v1, v2}, {v2, v3}, and {v1, v3}\n2. {v1, v2, v4} - formed by edges {v1, v2}, {v2, v4}, and {v1, v4}\n3. {v1, v3, v4} - formed by edges {v1, v3}, {v3, v4}, and {v1, v4}\n4. {v2, v3, v4} - formed by edges {v2, v3}, {v3, v4}, and {v2, v4}\n\nHowever, the edges {v1, v3} and {v2, v4} are not in the 1-skeleton, so triangles 1 and 4 are not valid faces of K. Therefore, there are 2 triangles in K that are not edges: {v1, v2, v4} and {v1, v3, v4}.\n\nNow let's consider the tetrahedra. There is only 1 possible tetrahedron, which is formed by all 4 vertices: {v1, v2, v3, v4}. However, for this tetrahedron to be a valid face of K, all 6 edges must be in the 1-skeleton. Since the edges {v1, v3} and {v2, v4} are not in the 1-skeleton, the tetrahedron is not a valid face of K.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 faces of K that are not edges: the triangles {v1, v2, v4} and {v1, v3, v4}."
