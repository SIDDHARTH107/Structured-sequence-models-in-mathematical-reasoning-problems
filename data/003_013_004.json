    "message_2": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the height of the tower (opposite side) to the distance from the base of the tower (adjacent side).\n\nLet h be the height of the tower. We are given the angle of elevation (60 degrees) and the distance from the base of the tower (30 meters). We can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(60°) = h / 30\n\nWe know that the tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3:\n\n√3 = h / 30\n\nNow, we can solve for h by multiplying both sides of the equation by 30:\n\nh = 30 * √3\n\nh ≈ 30 * 1.732\n\nh ≈ 51.96\n\nTherefore, the height of the tower is approximately 51.96 meters."
