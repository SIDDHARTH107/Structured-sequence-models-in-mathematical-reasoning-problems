    "message_2": "To simplify the exponential expression $5^3 \\cdot 5^5$, we use the rule for multiplying exponential expressions with the same base: $a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$. In this case, the base is 5, and the exponents are 3 and 5. \n\nSo, we have:\n\n$5^3 \\cdot 5^5 = 5^{3+5} = 5^8$\n\nThe simplified exponential expression is $5^8$."
