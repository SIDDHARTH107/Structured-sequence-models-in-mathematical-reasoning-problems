    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function on a given interval, we use the formula:\n\naverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nwhere a and b are the endpoints of the interval, and f(x) is the function.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = sin(2x), a = 0, and b = π. So, we have:\n\naverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[0, π] sin(2x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(2x) with respect to x from 0 to π:\n\n∫ sin(2x) dx = (-1/2) * cos(2x) + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the antiderivative at the endpoints of the interval:\n\n(-1/2) * cos(2π) - (-1/2) * cos(0)\n\n= (-1/2) * (1) - (-1/2) * (1)\n\n= -1/2 + 1/2\n\n= 0\n\nNow, we'll plug this result back into the average value formula:\n\naverage value = (1/π) * 0\n\n= 0\n\nSo, the average value of the function f(x) = sin(2x) on the interval [0, π] is 0."
