    "message_2": "To find the maximum temperature of the plate, we need to find the maximum value of the function $u(x,y,t)$. We can do this by finding the critical points of the function with respect to $x$, $y$, and $t$.\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of $u(x,y,t)$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $t$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = e^{-t}\\cos(x)\\cos(y)$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -e^{-t}\\sin(x)\\sin(y)$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -e^{-t}\\sin(x)\\cos(y)$\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting these partial derivatives equal to zero:\n\n$e^{-t}\\cos(x)\\cos(y) = 0$\n\n$-e^{-t}\\sin(x)\\sin(y) = 0$\n\n$-e^{-t}\\sin(x)\\cos(y) = 0$\n\nSince $e^{-t}$ is never equal to zero, we can ignore it in these equations. We are left with:\n\n$\\cos(x)\\cos(y) = 0$\n\n$-\\sin(x)\\sin(y) = 0$\n\n$-\\sin(x)\\cos(y) = 0$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get either $\\cos(x) = 0$ or $\\cos(y) = 0$. This means $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ or $y = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we get either $\\sin(x) = 0$ or $\\sin(y) = 0$. This means $x = 0, \\pi$ or $y = 0, \\pi$.\n\nFrom the third equation, we get either $\\sin(x) = 0$ or $\\cos(y) = 0$. This means $x = 0, \\pi$ or $y = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nCombining these results, we find that the critical points are $(x, y) = (0, 0), (0, \\pi), (\\pi, 0), (\\pi, \\pi), (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function $u(x,y,t)$ at these critical points:\n\n$u(0,0,t) = 0$\n\n$u(0,\\pi,t) = 0$\n\n$u(\\pi,0,t) = 0$\n\n$u(\\pi,\\pi,t) = 0$\n\n$u(\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{2},t) = e^{-t}\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = e^{-t}$\n\nThe maximum temperature occurs at the critical point $(x, y) = (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. To find the time at which this maximum temperature occurs, we need to find the maximum value of $e^{-t}$.\n\nSince $e^{-t}$ is a decreasing function for $t \\geq 0$, the maximum value of $e^{-t}$ occurs at $t = 0$. Therefore, the maximum temperature of the plate is $e^0 = 1$, and it occurs at time $t = 0$."
