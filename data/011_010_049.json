    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to completely parenthesize a sequence of 7 matrices, we can use the Catalan numbers. The Catalan number C_n gives the number of ways to parenthesize a sequence of n+1 matrices. The formula for the nth Catalan number is:\n\nC_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n)\n\nFor a sequence of 7 matrices, we need to find the 6th Catalan number (since we start counting from n=0 for a sequence of 1 matrix):\n\nC_6 = (1/(6+1)) * (2*6 choose 6)\nC_6 = (1/7) * (12 choose 6)\n\nNow, we need to calculate the binomial coefficient (12 choose 6):\n\n(12 choose 6) = 12! / (6! * (12-6)!)\n(12 choose 6) = 12! / (6! * 6!)\n\nUsing the factorial function:\n\n12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\n\n(12 choose 6) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2)\n(12 choose 6) = 924\n\nNow, we can find the 6th Catalan number:\n\nC_6 = (1/7) * 924\nC_6 = 132\n\nSo, there are 132 ways to completely parenthesize a sequence of 7 matrices."
