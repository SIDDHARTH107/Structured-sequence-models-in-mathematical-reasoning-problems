    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, Product A and Product B. The profit earned per unit of Product A is $10 and per unit of Product B is $15. The total production capacity is 120 units. Moreover, each unit of Product A takes 3 hours of machine time while each unit of Product B takes 5 hours of machine time. The total available machine time is 450 hours. Determine the number of units of each product to be produced to maximize the profit of the company.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. Total production capacity: x + y ≤ 120\n2. Total machine time: 3x + 5y ≤ 450\n3. Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the graphical method to find the feasible region and then determine the optimal solution by evaluating the profit function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the constraints as follows:\n\n1. y ≤ 120 - x\n2. y ≤ (450 - 3x) / 5\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, let's plot these inequalities on a coordinate plane:\n\n1. The line y = 120 - x is the boundary for the total production capacity constraint. All points below this line (including the line itself) satisfy this constraint.\n2. The line y = (450 - 3x) / 5 is the boundary for the total machine time constraint. All points below this line (including the line itself) satisfy this constraint.\n3. The axes x = 0 and y = 0 are the boundaries for the non-negativity constraints. All points in the first quadrant (including the axes) satisfy these constraints.\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied simultaneously. In this case, it is a quadrilateral with vertices at points A(0, 0), B(0, 90), C(30, 60), and D(120, 0).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(A) = P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(B) = P(0, 90) = 10(0) + 15(90) = $1350\n3. P(C) = P(30, 60) = 10(30) + 15(60) = $1200\n4. P(D) = P(120, 0) = 10(120) + 15(0) = $1200\n\nThe maximum profit is $1350, which occurs when the company produces 0 units of Product A and 90 units of Product B."
