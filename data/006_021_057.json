    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a hurricane occurring in a specific region of the Atlantic Ocean during hurricane season, we can use the historical data provided.\n\nSince a hurricane occurs in this region once every 10 years, the probability of a hurricane occurring in any given year is 1 in 10, or 1/10.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we can multiply the fraction by 100:\n\n(1/10) * 100 = 10%\n\nSo, the probability of a hurricane occurring in this specific region of the Atlantic Ocean during hurricane season is 10%."
