    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to x and y:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -2y$\n\nNow, we set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for x and y:\n\n$2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$-2y = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nSo, the only critical point is at (0, 0). However, we need to check if this point is within the given domain $[-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]$. Since 0 is within the interval [-1, 1], the point (0, 0) is indeed within the domain.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 critical point in the Morse-Smale complex of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2$ on the domain $[-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]$."
