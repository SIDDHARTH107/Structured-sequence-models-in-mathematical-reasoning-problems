    "message_1": "A manufacturer is considering whether to produce a new product or not. The estimated profit in a good market for the product is $50,000, while the estimated loss in a bad market is $20,000. The probability of a good market is 70%, while the probability of a bad market is 30%. Should the manufacturer produce the new product?",
    "message_2": "To determine whether the manufacturer should produce the new product, we can calculate the expected value of the profit or loss from producing the product.\n\nExpected value (EV) = (Probability of a good market * Profit in a good market) + (Probability of a bad market * Loss in a bad market)\n\nEV = (0.7 * $50,000) + (0.3 * -$20,000)\n\nEV = ($35,000) + (-$6,000)\n\nEV = $29,000\n\nSince the expected value is positive ($29,000), it indicates that the manufacturer can expect a profit on average if they produce the new product. Therefore, it is recommended that the manufacturer should produce the new product."
