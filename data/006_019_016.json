    "message_2": "Assuming the poll is an accurate representation of the entire voting population, the probability that a randomly chosen voter will vote for candidate A in the upcoming presidential elections is 60% or 0.6. However, it's important to note that polls may have some margin of error and may not perfectly represent the entire population."
