    "message_1": "A flagpole is 30 feet tall. You stand 50 feet away from the base of the flagpole and measure the angle of elevation to the top of the pole as 40 degrees. What is the height of the flagpole if you move back 20 feet and the angle of elevation to the top of the pole is now 30 degrees?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (height of the flagpole) to the adjacent side (distance from the flagpole) in a right triangle.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial situation where you are 50 feet away from the flagpole and the angle of elevation is 40 degrees. Let h be the height of the flagpole. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(40) = h / 50\n\nNow, let's consider the situation where you move back 20 feet, making the distance from the flagpole 70 feet, and the angle of elevation is 30 degrees. We can set up another equation:\n\ntan(30) = h / 70\n\nWe have a system of two equations with one unknown, h. We can solve for h by first solving the first equation for h:\n\nh = 50 * tan(40)\n\nNext, substitute this expression for h into the second equation:\n\ntan(30) = (50 * tan(40)) / 70\n\nNow, solve for h:\n\nh = 70 * tan(30) = 70 * (50 * tan(40)) / 70\n\nh = 50 * tan(40)\n\nSince the height of the flagpole remains the same in both situations, the height of the flagpole is:\n\nh = 50 * tan(40) â‰ˆ 41.81 feet"
