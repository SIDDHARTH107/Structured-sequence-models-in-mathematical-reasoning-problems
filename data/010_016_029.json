    "message_2": "Let's denote the two boundary components as A and B. To find the intersection number of A and B using Poincaré duality, we first need to find the homology classes of A and B in H_1(X; Z), the first homology group of X with integer coefficients.\n\nSince X is a compact orientable surface of genus 2, it can be obtained from a 2-holed torus by removing two open disks. Let α, β, γ, and δ be the four simple closed curves on the 2-holed torus that generate H_1(X; Z). We can assume that α and β form the first hole, and γ and δ form the second hole.\n\nNow, let's consider the boundary components A and B. We can assume that A is the boundary of the first hole and B is the boundary of the second hole. Therefore, A can be represented as the homology class [α] + [β] and B can be represented as the homology class [γ] + [δ] in H_1(X; Z).\n\nTo find the intersection number of A and B, we need to compute the cup product of their Poincaré duals in H^1(X; Z), the first cohomology group of X with integer coefficients. The Poincaré dual of A is PD(A) = α^* + β^*, and the Poincaré dual of B is PD(B) = γ^* + δ^*, where α^*, β^*, γ^*, and δ^* are the cohomology classes dual to α, β, γ, and δ, respectively.\n\nNow, we compute the cup product:\n\n(PD(A) ∪ PD(B))([X]) = (α^* + β^*) ∪ (γ^* + δ^*)([X]) = α^* ∪ γ^*([X]) + α^* ∪ δ^*([X]) + β^* ∪ γ^*([X]) + β^* ∪ δ^*([X]).\n\nSince α, β, γ, and δ are simple closed curves that do not intersect each other, their intersection numbers are all zero. Therefore, α^* ∪ γ^*([X]) = α^* ∪ δ^*([X]) = β^* ∪ γ^*([X]) = β^* ∪ δ^*([X]) = 0.\n\nThus, the intersection number of A and B is:\n\n(PD(A) ∪ PD(B))([X]) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nSo, the intersection number of the two boundary components A and B of the compact orientable surface of genus 2 is 0."
