    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student to solve regarding Prisoner's Dilemma in game theory:\n\nTwo players, Alice and Bob, are both accused of a crime and are being interrogated separately. Each of them has two possible options: cooperate with the authorities by confessing, or stay silent to protect the other person. If both stay silent, they each get a one-year sentence for a lesser crime. If both confess, they each get a five-year sentence. However, if one confesses and the other stays silent, the one who confesses gets a one-year sentence while the other gets a ten-year sentence. \n\nSuppose Alice and Bob are rational and are only concerned with minimizing their own sentence. What is the best strategy for each person and what will be the outcome?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best strategy for each person, we can create a payoff matrix to analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n```\n                  Alice\n                  Confess   Stay Silent\n           C      5, 5       1, 10\nBob       |\n           S     10, 1       1, 1\n```\n\nHere, the first number in each pair represents Bob's sentence length, and the second number represents Alice's sentence length.\n\nFor Alice:\n- If Bob confesses, Alice should confess (5 years) instead of staying silent (10 years).\n- If Bob stays silent, Alice should confess (1 year) instead of staying silent (1 year).\n\nFor Bob:\n- If Alice confesses, Bob should confess (5 years) instead of staying silent (10 years).\n- If Alice stays silent, Bob should confess (1 year) instead of staying silent (1 year).\n\nThe best strategy for each person is to confess, as it minimizes their sentence length regardless of the other person's choice. The outcome will be that both Alice and Bob confess, and they each receive a five-year sentence."
