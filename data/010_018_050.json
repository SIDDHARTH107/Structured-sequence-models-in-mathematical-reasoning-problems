    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a surface can be computed using the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nIn the case of a Morse-Smale complex defined on a closed orientable surface with genus g, the critical points of index 0, 1, and 2 correspond to vertices, edges, and faces respectively. Therefore, we have:\n\nV = 1 (index 0 critical points)\nE = g (index 1 critical points)\nF = 1 (index 2 critical points)\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ = V - E + F\nχ = 1 - g + 1\nχ = 2 - g\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of this surface is 2 - g."
