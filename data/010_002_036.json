    "message_2": "To determine whether the sequence (x_n) converges in the topological space X, we need to find a limit point x in X such that for any open neighborhood U of x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, x_n is in U.\n\nLet's consider the limit point x = 0. For any open neighborhood U of 0, there exists an open interval (a, b) containing 0 such that a < 0 < b and U contains (a, b). Since b > 0, there exists a natural number N such that 1/N < b (by the Archimedean property). \n\nNow, for all n > N, we have 1/n < 1/N < b. Since x_n = 1/n, it follows that x_n is in the open interval (a, b), and thus x_n is in the open neighborhood U. \n\nTherefore, the sequence (x_n) converges to the limit point x = 0 in the topological space X with the standard topology."
