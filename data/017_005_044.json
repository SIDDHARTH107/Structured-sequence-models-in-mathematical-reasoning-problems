    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 27, which is a prime power (3^3), we know that G is a p-group. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a normal Sylow 3-subgroup in G. Let's denote this subgroup as H.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of elements of order 3 in G. By Cauchy's theorem, there exists at least one element of order 3 in G. Let's denote this element as x. Since the order of x is 3, the subgroup generated by x, denoted as <x>, has order 3. Note that <x> is a subgroup of H.\n\nNow, let's consider the center of G, denoted as Z(G). Since G is a p-group, we know that Z(G) is nontrivial (i.e., it contains more than just the identity element). If Z(G) = G, then G is abelian and thus cyclic, as G is a finite p-group.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where Z(G) is a proper subgroup of G. Since Z(G) is nontrivial, its order must be a divisor of 27. The possible orders for Z(G) are 3 and 9. \n\n1. If |Z(G)| = 3, then Z(G) = <x> (as <x> is a subgroup of order 3). In this case, G/Z(G) has order 9, and since G/Z(G) is a group of prime square order, it must be abelian. Therefore, G is a semidirect product of Z(G) and a subgroup of order 9. Since Z(G) is cyclic of order 3, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\n2. If |Z(G)| = 9, then Z(G) is a subgroup of order 9. Since G is a group of prime power order, it must be abelian. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
