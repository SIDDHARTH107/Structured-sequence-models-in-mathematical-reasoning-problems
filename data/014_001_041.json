    "message_2": "To find the private key and encrypt the message \"TOP SECRET\" using RSA encryption, follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n and φ(n):\nn = p * q = 7 * 11 = 77\nφ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (7-1) * (11-1) = 6 * 10 = 60\n\n2. Find the private key (d):\nWe are given e = 13. We need to find d such that (e * d) % φ(n) = 1.\nIn other words, we need to find the modular inverse of e modulo φ(n).\n13 * d ≡ 1 (mod 60)\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find d.\nAfter applying the algorithm, we get d = 37.\n\nSo, the private key (d) is 37.\n\n3. Encrypt the message \"TOP SECRET\":\nFirst, we need to convert the message into numerical form. We can use the ASCII values of the characters and subtract 64 to represent A as 1, B as 2, and so on. For space, we can use 0.\n\nTOP SECRET -> 20 15 16 0 19 5 3 18 5 20\n\nNow, we will encrypt each number using the public key (n, e) = (77, 13):\nEncrypted_number = (number ^ e) % n\n\n20 -> (20^13) % 77 = 71\n15 -> (15^13) % 77 = 64\n16 -> (16^13) % 77 = 4\n0  -> (0^13) % 77 = 0\n19 -> (19^13) % 77 = 72\n5  -> (5^13) % 77 = 55\n3  -> (3^13) % 77 = 47\n18 -> (18^13) % 77 = 21\n5  -> (5^13) % 77 = 55\n20 -> (20^13) % 77 = 71\n\nThe encrypted message in numerical form is:\n71 64 4 0 72 55 47 21 55 71\n\nNow, you have successfully encrypted the message \"TOP SECRET\" using the RSA encryption technique with the given public key (77, 13). The encrypted message is \"71 64 4 0 72 55 47 21 55 71\"."
