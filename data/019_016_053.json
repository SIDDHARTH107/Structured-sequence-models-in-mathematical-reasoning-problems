The complement of set A in the set of natural numbers from 1 to 10 is the set of all natural numbers from 1 to 10 that are not in set A. This set is {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}.\n\n3. The intersection of set A with the set B is the set of all elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the intersection of set A and set B is {3, 5, 7}.\n\n4. The union of set A with the set B is the set of all elements that are in either set A or set B or both. In this case, the union of set A and set B is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11}."
