    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these sets:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\n(B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nAs we can see, the sets (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) are equal. However, the Cartesian products A × B and B × A are not equal, as the elements in each set are different. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union, as the order of the sets in the Cartesian product affects the resulting set."
