    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation with the given initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form u(x,t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\nX''(x)T(t) = X(x)T''(t)\n\nDividing both sides by X(x)T(t), we obtain:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = T''(t)/T(t)\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ^2:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = T''(t)/T(t) = -λ^2\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ^2X(x) = 0\nT''(t) + λ^2T(t) = 0\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nSince the endpoints are fixed, we have X(0) = X(L) = 0, where L is the length of the string. From X(0) = 0, we get A = 0. Thus, X(x) = B*sin(λx).\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues λ that satisfy X(L) = 0:\n\nB*sin(λL) = 0\n\nSince B ≠ 0, we must have sin(λL) = 0. This implies that λL = nπ for n = 1, 2, 3, .... Therefore, λ = nπ/L.\n\nThe general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C*cos(λct) + D*sin(λct)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for u(x,t) as a sum of the solutions for each λ:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [B_n*sin(nπx/L) * (C_n*cos(nπct/L) + D_n*sin(nπct/L))]\n\nApplying the initial conditions, we have:\n\nu(x,0) = 2sin(3x) = Σ [B_n*sin(nπx/L) * C_n]\nu_t(x,0) = 0 = Σ [B_n*sin(nπx/L) * (-nπc/L) * D_n]\n\nFrom the first equation, we can see that B_3 = 2 and C_3 = 1, and all other B_n and C_n are zero. From the second equation, we can see that D_n = 0 for all n.\n\nThus, the solution u(x,t) is:\n\nu(x,t) = 2sin(3πx/L) * cos(3πct/L)\n\nFinally, we want to find u(x,t) at time t = 2:\n\nu(x,2) = 2sin(3πx/L) * cos(3πc*2/L)"
