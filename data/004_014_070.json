    "message_2": "To find the volume of water that the tank can hold when filled up to a height of 8 meters, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 4 meters and the height (h) is 8 meters (since the tank is filled up to 8 meters, not its full height of 10 meters).\n\nV = π(4^2)(8)\nV = π(16)(8)\nV = 128π\n\nThe volume of water that the tank can hold when filled up to a height of 8 meters is 128π cubic meters."
