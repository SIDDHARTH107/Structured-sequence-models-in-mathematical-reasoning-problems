    "message_1": "A sound wave can be modeled by the function y = 3 sin(2πx + π/3), where y is the displacement of the wave, x is the distance traveled by the wave, and π is the constant pi. Find the amplitude and period of the sound wave.",
    "message_2": "The given function is y = 3 sin(2πx + π/3). This is a sine function in the form y = A sin(Bx + C), where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn this case, A = 3, which means the amplitude of the sound wave is 3 units.\n\nTo find the period, we need to look at the angular frequency B. In this case, B = 2π. The period (T) of a sine function is related to the angular frequency by the formula T = 2π / B.\n\nSo, T = 2π / (2π) = 1.\n\nThe amplitude of the sound wave is 3 units, and the period is 1 unit."
