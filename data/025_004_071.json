    "message_1": "Consider the rational curve given by the equation C: (x^2 - y^2 -1)^2 - 4x^2 = 0 in the projective plane with homogeneous coordinates [x:y:z]. \n\nWhat is the degree of the rational curve C?",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of the rational curve C, we first need to homogenize the given equation. We can do this by replacing x with x/z and y with y/z, and then clearing the denominators.\n\nThe homogenized equation is:\n\n((x^2 - y^2 - z^2)^2 - 4x^2z^2 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the highest degree of the terms in the equation. Let's expand the equation:\n\n(x^4 - 2x^2y^2 + y^4 - 2x^2z^2 + 2y^2z^2 - z^4) - 4x^2z^2 = 0\n\nThe highest degree term in the expanded equation is x^4, which has a degree of 4. Therefore, the degree of the rational curve C is 4."
