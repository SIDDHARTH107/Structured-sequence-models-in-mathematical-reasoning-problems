    "message_1": "A company hires a manager to take decisions on their behalf, but there is a risk of the manager not acting in the company's best interest due to their own interest. The manager's effort level affects the company's profit, and the manager's effort level depends on their wage. The company can offer a wage of $10,000 or $20,000 to the manager. The manager's effort can result in either a profit of $50,000 or $70,000 for the company. If the manager is risk-averse and the probability of exerting high effort is the same for both wages, what is the minimum probability of the manager engaging in high effort for the company to offer $20,000?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability of the manager engaging in high effort as p. Since the manager is risk-averse, they will choose the wage that maximizes their expected utility. We need to find the minimum value of p for which the company would prefer to offer the $20,000 wage.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected profit for the company under each wage scenario:\n\n1. If the company offers a wage of $10,000:\nExpected profit = p * (High profit - Wage) + (1 - p) * (Low profit - Wage)\nExpected profit = p * ($50,000 - $10,000) + (1 - p) * ($70,000 - $10,000)\nExpected profit = p * $40,000 + (1 - p) * $60,000\n\n2. If the company offers a wage of $20,000:\nExpected profit = p * (High profit - Wage) + (1 - p) * (Low profit - Wage)\nExpected profit = p * ($50,000 - $20,000) + (1 - p) * ($70,000 - $20,000)\nExpected profit = p * $30,000 + (1 - p) * $50,000\n\nThe company would prefer to offer the $20,000 wage if the expected profit under that scenario is greater than the expected profit under the $10,000 wage scenario. So, we need to find the minimum value of p for which:\n\np * $30,000 + (1 - p) * $50,000 > p * $40,000 + (1 - p) * $60,000\n\nSimplifying the inequality:\n\n30,000p + 50,000 - 50,000p > 40,000p + 60,000 - 60,000p\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n(30,000p - 40,000p) + (50,000p - 60,000p) > 60,000 - 50,000\n\n-10,000p - 10,000p > 10,000\n\n-20,000p > 10,000\n\nDivide both sides by -20,000 (and remember to flip the inequality sign since we're dividing by a negative number):\n\np < -10,000 / 20,000\n\np < -1/2\n\nSince the probability cannot be negative, there is no minimum probability of the manager engaging in high effort for the company to offer $20,000 under these conditions. The company would always prefer to offer the $10,000 wage."
