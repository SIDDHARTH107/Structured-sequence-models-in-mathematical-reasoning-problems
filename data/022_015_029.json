The reflection principle states that if $f$ is a holomorphic function in a domain $D$ which is symmetric with respect to the real axis, and if $f(z)$ is real for all $z$ on the real axis, then $f$ admits a unique holomorphic extension to the reflection domain $D'$, which is also symmetric with respect to the real axis, such that $f(z) = \\overline{f(\\bar z)}$ for all $z \\in D$. Using this principle, find the value of $f'(\\pi i/2)$ if $f(z) = e^z$.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the derivative of the function $f(z) = e^z$. Since $f(z)$ is a holomorphic function, its derivative is also holomorphic. The derivative of $e^z$ with respect to $z$ is simply $e^z$. So, $f'(z) = e^z$.\n\nNow, let's apply the Schwarz reflection principle. We know that $f(z) = e^z$ is holomorphic in the entire complex plane, which is symmetric with respect to the real axis. Also, $f(z)$ is real for all $z$ on the real axis, since $e^x$ is real for all real $x$. Therefore, the Schwarz reflection principle applies, and we have $f(z) = \\overline{f(\\bar z)}$ for all $z$ in the complex plane.\n\nTaking the derivative of both sides with respect to $z$, we get $f'(z) = \\overline{f'(\\bar z)}$. Now, we want to find the value of $f'(\\pi i/2)$. First, let's find the conjugate of $\\pi i/2$, which is $-\\pi i/2$. Now, we can find the value of $f'(-\\pi i/2)$:\n\n$$f'(-\\pi i/2) = e^{-\\pi i/2} = \\cos(-\\pi/2) + i\\sin(-\\pi/2) = 0 - i.$$\n\nNow, we can use the Schwarz reflection principle to find the value of $f'(\\pi i/2)$:\n\n$$f'(\\pi i/2) = \\overline{f'(-\\pi i/2)} = \\overline{0 - i} = 0 + i.$$\n\nSo, the value of $f'(\\pi i/2)$ is $0 + i$ or simply $i$."
