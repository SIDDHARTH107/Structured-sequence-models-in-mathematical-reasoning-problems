    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = (2z^2 + 6) / (z - 1) at the point z = 1, we first rewrite the function as a sum of simpler functions that can be easily expanded as a Laurent series.\n\nLet's rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (2z^2 + 6) / (z - 1)\n     = 2z^2 / (z - 1) + 6 / (z - 1)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion of each term separately.\n\nFor the first term, we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n1 / (z - 1) = 1 / (1 - (1 - z)) = Σ (1 - z)^n, where the sum is from n = 0 to infinity.\n\nSo, 2z^2 / (z - 1) = 2z^2 * Σ (1 - z)^n.\n\nFor the second term, we can also use the geometric series formula:\n\n6 / (z - 1) = 6 * Σ (1 - z)^n.\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) by combining the expansions of the two terms:\n\nf(z) = 2z^2 * Σ (1 - z)^n + 6 * Σ (1 - z)^n.\n\nTo find the Laurent series expansion at the point z = 1, we can substitute z = 1 + w, where w is a small complex number:\n\nf(1 + w) = 2(1 + w)^2 * Σ (1 - (1 + w))^n + 6 * Σ (1 - (1 + w))^n\n         = 2(1 + 2w + w^2) * Σ (-w)^n + 6 * Σ (-w)^n.\n\nNow, we can expand the series:\n\nf(1 + w) = 2(1 + 2w + w^2) * (1 - w + w^2 - w^3 + ...) + 6 (1 - w + w^2 - w^3 + ...).\n\nNow, we can multiply the series term by term:\n\nf(1 + w) = 2(1 - 2w + 4w^2 - 6w^3 + ...) + 12w(1 - w + w^2 - w^3 + ...).\n\nFinally, we can combine the terms:\n\nf(1 + w) = 2 - 10w + 26w^2 - 62w^3 + ...\n\nSo, the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = (2z^2 + 6) / (z - 1) at the point z = 1 is:\n\nf(z) = 2 - 10(w) + 26(w)^2 - 62(w)^3 + ...,\n\nwhere w = z - 1."
