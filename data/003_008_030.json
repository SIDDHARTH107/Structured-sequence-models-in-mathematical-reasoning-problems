    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can use the sine formula for the area of a triangle: \n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle)\n\nHowever, we need to find the angle between the base and the height. Since we have a right-angled triangle (the height is perpendicular to the base), the angle between the base and the height is 90 degrees.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 12 cm * 8 cm * sin(90 degrees)\n\nSince sin(90 degrees) = 1:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 12 cm * 8 cm * 1\nArea = 6 cm * 8 cm\nArea = 48 cmÂ²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 48 square centimeters."
