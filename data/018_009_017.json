    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products:\n\n1. (A × B) × {6}\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A × B) and {6}:\n(A × B) × {6} = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\n\n2. A × (B × {6})\nFirst, let's find the Cartesian product of B and {6}:\nB × {6} = {(4, 6), (5, 6)}\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of A and (B × {6}):\nA × (B × {6}) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets:\n\n(A × B) × {6} = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\n\nA × (B × {6}) = {(1, (4, 6)), (1, (5, 6)), (2, (4, 6)), (2, (5, 6)), (3, (4, 6)), (3, (5, 6))}\n\nAlthough the elements in the sets look different, they represent the same relationships between the elements of sets A, B, and {6}. We can rewrite the elements of the second set to match the first set:\n\nA × (B × {6}) = {((1, 4), 6), ((1, 5), 6), ((2, 4), 6), ((2, 5), 6), ((3, 4), 6), ((3, 5), 6)}\n\nNow, we can see that:\n\n(A × B) × {6} = A × (B × {6})\n\nThis demonstrates the associativity of the Cartesian product."
