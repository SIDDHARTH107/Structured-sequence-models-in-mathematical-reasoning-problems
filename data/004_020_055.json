    "message_1": "A 20 pound force is used to lift a box vertically for a distance of 5 feet. Find the work done by the force in lifting the box using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force in lifting the box, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = Force × Distance × cos(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the force and the direction of motion. In this case, the force is acting vertically, and the box is being lifted vertically, so the angle θ is 0 degrees. The cosine of 0 degrees is 1, so the formula simplifies to:\n\nWork = Force × Distance\n\nWe are given the force (20 pounds) and the distance (5 feet), so we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nWork = 20 pounds × 5 feet\n\nWork = 100 foot-pounds\n\nSo, the work done by the force in lifting the box is 100 foot-pounds. Note that in this particular problem, integration is not necessary, as the force is constant throughout the lifting process."
