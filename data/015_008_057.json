    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant, denoted by $\\delta$, is a universal constant that appears in the study of bifurcation diagrams of nonlinear systems, such as the logistic map. It is defined as the limiting ratio of consecutive bifurcation intervals as the control parameter approaches a critical value.\n\nFor the logistic map, the critical value of the control parameter is $r_c = 3.5699456...$. The Feigenbaum constant is given by:\n\n$$\\delta = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{r_{n} - r_{n-1}}{r_{n+1} - r_{n}}$$\n\nwhere $r_n$ are the values of the control parameter at which bifurcations occur.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the Feigenbaum constant when $r=4$. The Feigenbaum constant is a universal constant and does not depend on the specific value of the control parameter. Therefore, the value of $\\delta$ remains the same regardless of the value of $r$.\n\nThe Feigenbaum constant is approximately:\n\n$$\\delta \\approx 4.6692016091$$"
