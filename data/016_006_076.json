    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern is generated using an Iterated Function System (IFS) consisting of four affine transformations. Each transformation has a scaling factor associated with it. The scaling ratios for each transformation are as follows:\n\n1. Transformation 1 (f1): Scaling ratio = 0.01\n2. Transformation 2 (f2): Scaling ratio = 0.85\n3. Transformation 3 (f3): Scaling ratio = 0.2\n4. Transformation 4 (f4): Scaling ratio = 0.15\n\nThese scaling ratios are applied to the initial line segment in each iteration to generate the Barnsley fern. The scaling ratios are used with their corresponding probabilities to determine which transformation to apply in each iteration. The probabilities are:\n\n1. Transformation 1 (f1): Probability = 0.01\n2. Transformation 2 (f2): Probability = 0.85\n3. Transformation 3 (f3): Probability = 0.07\n4. Transformation 4 (f4): Probability = 0.07\n\nSo, the scaling ratios required to generate the Barnsley fern using the IFS equations are 0.01, 0.85, 0.2, and 0.15 for transformations f1, f2, f3, and f4, respectively."
