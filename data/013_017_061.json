The dealership sells the high-quality car for $15,000 and the low-quality car for $9,000. Assume that half of the cars in the lot are high quality, and half are low quality. If a potential customer assumes that 90% of the cars on the lot are high quality, what is the expected profit for the dealership?",
    "message_2": "Let's first calculate the profit for each type of car:\n\nProfit for high-quality car = Selling price - Cost price = $15,000 - $10,000 = $5,000\nProfit for low-quality car = Selling price - Cost price = $9,000 - $4,000 = $5,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit for the dealership based on the customer's assumption:\n\nSince the customer assumes that 90% of the cars on the lot are high quality, the expected profit from selling a high-quality car is 0.9 * $5,000 = $4,500.\n\nSimilarly, the customer assumes that 10% of the cars on the lot are low quality, so the expected profit from selling a low-quality car is 0.1 * $5,000 = $500.\n\nHowever, the actual distribution of cars in the lot is 50% high quality and 50% low quality. To find the actual expected profit, we need to take into account the true distribution of cars:\n\nActual expected profit from selling a high-quality car = 0.5 * $5,000 = $2,500\nActual expected profit from selling a low-quality car = 0.5 * $5,000 = $2,500\n\nNow, we can add the actual expected profits from selling both types of cars to find the total expected profit for the dealership:\n\nTotal expected profit = Actual expected profit from selling a high-quality car + Actual expected profit from selling a low-quality car = $2,500 + $2,500 = $5,000"
