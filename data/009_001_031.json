    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\nAccording to a population growth model using differential equations, the rate of change of a certain population is proportional to the size of the population. If the initial population size is 10,000 and the doubling time of the population is 5 years, what is the size of the population after 20 years?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the exponential growth formula:\n\nP(t) = P0 * (2^(t/T))\n\nwhere:\nP(t) = population size at time t\nP0 = initial population size (10,000 in this case)\nt = time in years (20 years in this case)\nT = doubling time in years (5 years in this case)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the population size after 20 years:\n\nP(20) = 10,000 * (2^(20/5))\n\nP(20) = 10,000 * (2^4)\n\nP(20) = 10,000 * 16\n\nP(20) = 160,000\n\nSo, the size of the population after 20 years is 160,000."
