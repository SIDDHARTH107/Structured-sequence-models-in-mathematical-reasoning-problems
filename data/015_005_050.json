    "message_2": "To find the maximum Lyapunov exponent value for the Rössler system with given parameters, we need to numerically compute it. The Rössler system is a set of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nwith parameters a = 0.1, b = 0.1, and c = 14.\n\nThe maximum Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions and is related to the chaotic behavior of the system. Computing the maximum Lyapunov exponent involves solving the Rössler system and its variational equations, which can be done using numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method.\n\nUnfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to perform numerical computations directly. However, I can guide you on how to compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent using a programming language or software like MATLAB, Python, or Mathematica."
