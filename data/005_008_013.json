    "message_1": "A company has recorded its sales for the past 12 months. The sales figures are:\n\n$10,000, $11,000, $12,000, $16,000, $18,000, $20,000, $22,000, $24,000, $26,000, $28,000, $30,000, $32,000\n\nFind the following statistics for the sales data:\n1. Mean\n2. Median\n3. Mode\n4. Range\n5. Variance\n6. Standard deviation",
    "message_2": "1. Mean:\nTo find the mean, add up all the sales figures and divide by the number of months (12).\n\nMean = ($10,000 + $11,000 + $12,000 + $16,000 + $18,000 + $20,000 + $22,000 + $24,000 + $26,000 + $28,000 + $30,000 + $32,000) / 12\nMean = $239,000 / 12\nMean = $19,916.67\n\n2. Median:\nTo find the median, arrange the sales figures in ascending order and find the middle value. Since there are 12 months (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values.\n\nThe sales figures are already in ascending order. The two middle values are $20,000 and $22,000.\n\nMedian = ($20,000 + $22,000) / 2\nMedian = $42,000 / 2\nMedian = $21,000\n\n3. Mode:\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. In this case, there are no repeating values, so there is no mode.\n\n4. Range:\nTo find the range, subtract the lowest sales figure from the highest sales figure.\n\nRange = $32,000 - $10,000\nRange = $22,000\n\n5. Variance:\nTo find the variance, first calculate the mean. Then, subtract the mean from each sales figure, square the result, and find the average of those squared differences.\n\nMean = $19,916.67\n\nSquared differences:\n(10,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 98,611,111.11\n(11,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 79,611,111.11\n(12,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 62,611,111.11\n(16,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 15,361,111.11\n(18,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 3,680,555.56\n(20,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 6,944.44\n(22,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 4,340,277.78\n(24,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 16,611,111.11\n(26,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 36,611,111.11\n(28,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 64,611,111.11\n(30,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 100,611,111.11\n(32,000 - 19,916.67)^2 = 144,611,111.11\n\nSum of squared differences = 726,611,111.11\n\nVariance = Sum of squared differences / (Number of months - 1)\nVariance = 726,611,111.11 / (12 - 1)\nVariance = 726,611,111.11 / 11\nVariance = 66,055,555.56\n\n6. Standard deviation:\nTo find the standard deviation, take the square root of the variance.\n\nStandard deviation = √66,055,555.56\nStandard deviation ≈ $8,125.77"
