    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using Fourier series, we first assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the given PDE:\n\n∂u/∂t = k ∂²u/∂x²\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = k T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nNow, we can separate variables by dividing both sides by u(x, t) = X(x)T(t):\n\n(1/T(t)) ∂T(t)/∂t = k (1/X(x)) ∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\n(1/T(t)) ∂T(t)/∂t = -λ\nk (1/X(x)) ∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nFor T(t):\ndT(t)/dt = -λT(t)\n\nFor X(x):\nd²X(x)/dx² = -(λ/k)X(x)\n\nThe equation for X(x) is an eigenvalue problem with homogeneous boundary conditions X(0) = X(π) = 0. The solutions are given by:\n\nX_n(x) = sin(n x), λ_n = n²k, n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we can find the corresponding solutions for T(t):\n\nT_n(t) = exp(-n²kt)\n\nThe general solution for u(x, t) is given by the sum of these solutions:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [A_n sin(n x) exp(-n²kt)]\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients A_n using the initial condition u(x, 0) = x(π - x):\n\nx(π - x) = Σ [A_n sin(n x)]\n\nWe can find A_n by multiplying both sides by sin(m x) and integrating from 0 to π:\n\n∫₀^π x(π - x) sin(m x) dx = A_m ∫₀^π sin²(m x) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts and the orthogonality of sine functions, we can find A_m:\n\nA_m = (2/π) ∫₀^π x(π - x) sin(m x) dx\n\nNow, we have the solution for u(x, t):\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [(2/π) ∫₀^π x(π - x) sin(m x) dx sin(m x) exp(-m²kt)]\n\nThis is the solution for u(x, t) for 0 ≤ x ≤ π and t > 0."
