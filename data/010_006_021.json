    "message_2": "The fundamental group of a torus with one point removed can be calculated using the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. \n\nConsider the torus as the union of two open sets U and V, where U is the torus with a small open disk removed around the missing point, and V is an open disk containing the missing point. The intersection of U and V is an annulus.\n\nThe fundamental group of U is the same as the fundamental group of the torus since removing a small open disk does not change the homotopy type. The fundamental group of a torus is given by the direct product of two copies of the integers: π1(T^2) = Z × Z.\n\nThe fundamental group of V is trivial since it is an open disk, which is contractible: π1(V) = {e}.\n\nThe intersection U ∩ V is an annulus, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1. Thus, the fundamental group of the intersection is the integers: π1(U ∩ V) = Z.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem:\n\nπ1(T^2 - {p}) = (π1(U) * π1(V)) / N\n\nwhere N is the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i*(a) * j^(-1) * (b), with i: π1(U ∩ V) → π1(U) and j: π1(U ∩ V) → π1(V) being the inclusion maps, and a, b are elements in π1(U ∩ V).\n\nSince π1(V) is trivial, the only element in N is i*(a) * j^(-1) * (b) = i(a) * e * e = i(a). Thus, N is generated by i(a) for all a in π1(U ∩ V) = Z.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nπ1(T^2 - {p}) = (Z × Z) / N\n\nSince N is generated by i(a) for all a in Z, and i(a) = (a, a) in Z × Z, the fundamental group of the torus with one point removed is given by:\n\nπ1(T^2 - {p}) = Z × Z / {(a, a) | a ∈ Z} ≅ Z × Z_2\n\nwhere Z_2 is the integers modulo 2."
