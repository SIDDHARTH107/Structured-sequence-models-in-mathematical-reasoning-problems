    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given function f(t) = 3sin(4t) + 5cos(6t), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over the interval (-∞, ∞).\n\nLet's break the function into two parts: f1(t) = 3sin(4t) and f2(t) = 5cos(6t).\n\nNow, we will find the Fourier transform of each part separately.\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[3sin(4t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nF2(ω) = ∫[5cos(6t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nSince the Fourier transform is a linear operation, the Fourier transform of the sum of the functions is the sum of their individual Fourier transforms:\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω)\n\nNow, let's find F1(ω) and F2(ω) using integration:\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[3sin(4t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = 3sin(4t) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = 12cos(4t) dt and v = -1/(jω) * e^(-jωt).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula, we get:\n\nF1(ω) = -3/(jω) * [sin(4t) * e^(-jωt)] - ∫[-12/(jω) * cos(4t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we need to integrate the second term. Let u = -12/(jω) * cos(4t) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = 48/(jω) * sin(4t) dt and v = -1/(jω) * e^(-jωt).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula again, we get:\n\nF1(ω) = -3/(jω) * [sin(4t) * e^(-jωt)] + 12/(ω^2) * [cos(4t) * e^(-jωt)] - ∫[48/(ω^2) * sin(4t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we have the same integral we started with on the right side. Let's call this integral I:\n\nI = ∫[3sin(4t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nI = -3/(jω) * [sin(4t) * e^(-jωt)] + 12/(ω^2) * [cos(4t) * e^(-jωt)] - 48/(ω^2) * I\n\nNow, let's solve for I:\n\nI * (1 + 48/(ω^2)) = -3/(jω) * [sin(4t) * e^(-jωt)] + 12/(ω^2) * [cos(4t) * e^(-jωt)]\n\nI = (-3/(jω) * [sin(4t) * e^(-jωt)] + 12/(ω^2) * [cos(4t) * e^(-jωt)]) / (1 + 48/(ω^2))\n\nNow, let's find F2(ω):\n\nF2(ω) = ∫[5cos(6t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = 5cos(6t) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = -30sin(6t) dt and v = -1/(jω) * e^(-jωt).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula, we get:\n\nF2(ω) = -5/(jω) * [cos(6t) * e^(-jωt)] + ∫[30/(jω) * sin(6t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we need to integrate the second term. Let u = 30/(jω) * sin(6t) and dv = e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = 180/(jω) * cos(6t) dt and v = -1/(jω) * e^(-jωt).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula again, we get:\n\nF2(ω) = -5/(jω) * [cos(6t) * e^(-jωt)] - 30/(ω^2) * [sin(6t) * e^(-jωt)] + ∫[-180/(ω^2) * cos(6t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we have the same integral we started with on the right side. Let's call this integral J:\n\nJ = ∫[5cos(6t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nJ = -5/(jω) * [cos(6t) * e^(-jωt)] - 30/(ω^2) * [sin(6t) * e^(-jωt)] + 180/(ω^2) * J\n\nNow, let's solve for J:\n\nJ = (-5/(jω) * [cos(6t) * e^(-jωt)] - 30/(ω^2) * [sin(6t) * e^(-jωt)]) / (1 - 180/(ω^2))\n\nFinally, we can find the Fourier transform F(ω) by adding F1(ω) and F2(ω):\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω)\nF(ω) = (-3/(jω) * [sin(4t) * e^(-jωt)] + 12/(ω^2) * [cos(4t) * e^(-jωt)]) / (1 + 48/(ω^2)) + (-5/(jω) * [cos(6t) * e^(-jωt)] - 30/(ω^2) * [sin(6t) * e^(-jωt)]) / (1 - 180/(ω^2))\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the given function f(t) = 3sin(4t) + 5cos(6t) over the interval (-∞, ∞)."
