    "message_2": "To find the key used for the encryption, we need to determine the shift applied to each letter in the plaintext message \"MATH\" to obtain the ciphertext \"PDWE\". We can do this by comparing the positions of the letters in the alphabet.\n\nPlaintext:  M  A  T  H\nPosition:  13  1  20  8\n\nCiphertext: P  D  W  E\nPosition:  16  4  23  5\n\nNow, let's find the shift for each letter:\n\nM -> P: 16 - 13 = 3\nA -> D: 4 - 1 = 3\nT -> W: 23 - 20 = 3\nH -> E: 5 - 8 = -3 (wrap around the alphabet, 26 + (-3) = 23)\n\nThe key used for the encryption is a shift of 3 positions forward in the alphabet."
