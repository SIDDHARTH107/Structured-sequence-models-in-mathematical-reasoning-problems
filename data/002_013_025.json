    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base length of 6cm and a width of 4cm. If the height of the pyramid is 9cm, what is the volume of the rectangular pyramid in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\n\nThe base area of the pyramid can be found by multiplying the length and width:\n\nBase area = length * width\nBase area = 6cm * 4cm\nBase area = 24 square centimeters\n\nNow, we can find the volume:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base area * height\nVolume = (1/3) * 24cmÂ² * 9cm\nVolume = (1/3) * 216 cubic centimeters\nVolume = 72 cubic centimeters\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 72 cubic centimeters."
