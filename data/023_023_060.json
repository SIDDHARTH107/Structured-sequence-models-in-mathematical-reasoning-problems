    "message_1": "A communication network is transmitting data at a rate of 10 Mbps. The receiving end of the network is experiencing some distortion due to the presence of an interfering signal at a frequency of 2 MHz. If we want to use the Fourier transform to analyze the behavior of this network and remove the interference, what is the bandwidth required for the filter?",
    "message_2": "To remove the interference from the communication network, we need to design a filter that allows the data signal to pass through while blocking the interfering signal. The data signal has a rate of 10 Mbps, which means its bandwidth is 10 MHz (assuming a simple relationship between data rate and bandwidth). The interfering signal has a frequency of 2 MHz.\n\nTo effectively remove the interference, the filter should have a bandwidth that is wide enough to cover the data signal but narrow enough to exclude the interfering signal. In this case, the filter bandwidth should be greater than or equal to 10 MHz (to cover the data signal) and less than 2 MHz (to exclude the interfering signal).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that designing a filter with such a precise bandwidth is challenging in practice. In reality, the filter's bandwidth would likely need to be slightly larger than 10 MHz to account for the transition band and ensure that the data signal is not distorted. The exact bandwidth required would depend on the specific filter design and the desired level of interference rejection."
