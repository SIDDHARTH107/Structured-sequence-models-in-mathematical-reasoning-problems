    "message_2": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). The first five perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, 8128, and 33,550,336.\n\nThe sixth perfect number can be found using the formula for even perfect numbers, which is given by:\n\nN = 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1)\n\nwhere p and 2^p - 1 are both prime numbers. This formula is derived from the work of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid and later extended by the Swiss mathematician Euler.\n\nTo find the sixth perfect number, we need to find the next pair of prime numbers that satisfy the formula. The first five pairs of prime numbers (p, 2^p - 1) are:\n\n(2, 3), (3, 7), (5, 31), (7, 127), and (13, 8191)\n\nThe next pair of prime numbers that satisfy the formula are (17, 131071):\n\n2^17 - 1 = 131071 (which is a prime number)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nN = 2^(17-1) * (2^17 - 1)\nN = 2^16 * 131071\nN = 65,536 * 131071\nN = 8,589,869,056\n\nSo, the sixth perfect number is 8,589,869,056."
