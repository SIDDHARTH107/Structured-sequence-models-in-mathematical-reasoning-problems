    "message_1": "In a school, there are 12 students in a class. The teacher is distributing 10 identical chocolates among them. What is the number of ways in which the chocolates can be distributed among the students such that no student gets more than 3 chocolates?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using generating functions. Let x^i represent the number of chocolates given to a student. Since no student can get more than 3 chocolates, the generating function for each student is:\n\n(1 + x + x^2 + x^3)\n\nSince there are 12 students, the generating function for the whole class is:\n\n(1 + x + x^2 + x^3)^12\n\nWe want to find the coefficient of x^10 in this generating function, which represents the number of ways to distribute 10 chocolates among the students.\n\nUsing the multinomial theorem, we can expand the generating function:\n\n(1 + x + x^2 + x^3)^12 = Î£ (12! / (a! * b! * c! * d!)) * x^(a + 2b + 3c + 4d)\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers, and a + b + c + d = 12.\n\nWe are interested in the coefficient of x^10, so we need to find the values of a, b, c, and d that satisfy:\n\na + 2b + 3c + 4d = 10\n\nWe can find the possible combinations of a, b, c, and d:\n\n1. a = 10, b = 0, c = 0, d = 2\n2. a = 8, b = 1, c = 0, d = 3\n3. a = 6, b = 2, c = 0, d = 4\n4. a = 4, b = 3, c = 0, d = 5\n5. a = 2, b = 4, c = 0, d = 6\n6. a = 0, b = 5, c = 0, d = 7\n\nNow, we can find the coefficients for each combination:\n\n1. (12! / (10! * 0! * 0! * 2!)) = 66\n2. (12! / (8! * 1! * 0! * 3!)) = 495\n3. (12! / (6! * 2! * 0! * 4!)) = 1386\n4. (12! / (4! * 3! * 0! * 5!)) = 1386\n5. (12! / (2! * 4! * 0! * 6!)) = 495\n6. (12! / (0! * 5! * 0! * 7!)) = 66\n\nSumming up the coefficients, we get:\n\n66 + 495 + 1386 + 1386 + 495 + 66 = 3894\n\nSo, there are 3894 ways to distribute the 10 chocolates among the 12 students such that no student gets more than 3 chocolates."
