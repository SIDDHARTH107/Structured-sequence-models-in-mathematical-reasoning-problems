    "message_1": "If a transposition cipher with 8 columns and 5 rows is used to encrypt a message, how many possible arrangements of letters are there?",
    "message_2": "A transposition cipher with 8 columns and 5 rows means that there are 40 positions for the letters (8 columns * 5 rows). However, the number of possible arrangements depends on the order in which the columns are rearranged during the encryption process.\n\nSince there are 8 columns, there are 8! (8 factorial) ways to rearrange the columns. 8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320.\n\nSo, there are 40,320 possible arrangements of letters in a transposition cipher with 8 columns and 5 rows."
