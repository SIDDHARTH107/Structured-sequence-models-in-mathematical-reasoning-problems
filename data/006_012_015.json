    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a burglary occurring in a particular neighborhood, we can use the historical data provided. There have been 3 burglaries reported within the last year in a neighborhood with 40 houses.\n\nProbability = (Number of burglaries) / (Total number of houses)\n\nProbability = 3 / 40\n\nProbability = 0.075\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in this particular neighborhood is 0.075 or 7.5%."
