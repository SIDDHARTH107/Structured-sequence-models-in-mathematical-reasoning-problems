    "message_2": "Using the unit circle, the exact value of sin 60° can be found by considering a 30-60-90 right triangle. In this triangle, the ratios of the sides are 1:√3:2. \n\nWhen the angle is 60°, the side opposite the angle is √3 times the length of the side adjacent to the angle. Therefore, the sine of 60° is the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.\n\nsin(60°) = (√3/2) / 2 = √3/2\n\nSo, the exact value of sin 60° using the unit circle is √3/2."
