    "message_2": "To simplify the expression √32, we can break down 32 into its prime factors:\n\n32 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 (2 raised to the power of 5)\n\nNow, we can pair up the factors in groups of 2:\n\n(2 × 2) × (2 × 2) × 2\n\nSince the square root of a number squared is the number itself, we can simplify the expression:\n\n√(2 × 2) × √(2 × 2) × √2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2 × 2 × √2\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n4√2"
