    "message_2": "According to the forecaster's prediction, there is a 75% chance of rain each day. To find the expected number of rainy days in a 30-day month, we can multiply the total number of days by the probability of rain:\n\n30 days * 0.75 (75% chance of rain) = 22.5 days\n\nWe can expect about 22.5 days of rain this month according to the forecaster's prediction. Since we cannot have half a day of rain, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can expect approximately 23 days of rain this month."
