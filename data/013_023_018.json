    "message_1": "Consider a Trust Game with two players, A and B. Player A is given $10 and can choose to either keep the full amount or send some portion of it to player B. Whatever amount A sends will be tripled by the experimenter and given to player B. Player B then decides how much to send back to player A (any amount returned by B will not be tripled). If B returns $5, how much did player A send to player B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount player A sends to player B. Then, the experimenter triples this amount, so player B receives 3x. Since player B returns $5 to player A, we can set up the following equation:\n\n3x - 5 = 5\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n\n3x = 10\nx = 10/3 â‰ˆ $3.33\n\nSo, player A sent approximately $3.33 to player B."
