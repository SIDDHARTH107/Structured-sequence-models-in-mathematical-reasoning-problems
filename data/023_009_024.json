    "message_1": "A rectangular plate has dimensions 2 by 3 meters. The temperature on the four edges of the plate is maintained at 0 degrees Celsius, and the initial temperature of the plate is given by the function f(x,y) = 20*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y), where x and y are measured in meters. If the plate is allowed to cool over time and eventually reaches a steady state, what is the temperature distribution function on the plate? Use the Fourier transform to solve this boundary value problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the temperature distribution function on the plate, u(x, y), can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\nu(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)\n\nThe heat equation in two dimensions is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity of the material. Since the plate is allowed to cool over time and eventually reaches a steady state, the temperature distribution function will not depend on time, so ∂u/∂t = 0. Thus, we have:\n\n0 = α(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nSubstituting u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y), we get:\n\n0 = α(Y(x)∂²X/∂x² + X(y)∂²Y/∂y²)\n\nDividing by αXY, we obtain:\n\n0 = (1/X)(∂²X/∂x²) + (1/Y)(∂²Y/∂y²)\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. We set:\n\n(1/X)(∂²X/∂x²) = -λ\n(1/Y)(∂²Y/∂y²) = λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n∂²X/∂x² = -λX\n∂²Y/∂y² = λY\n\nWe solve these equations subject to the boundary conditions X(0) = X(2) = 0 and Y(0) = Y(3) = 0.\n\nFor the X equation, the general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A*sin(√λx) + B*cos(√λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nX(0) = B = 0\nX(2) = A*sin(2√λ) = 0\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have sin(2√λ) = 0. This implies that √λ = nπ/2 for some integer n. Thus, λ = (nπ/2)².\n\nFor the Y equation, the general solution is:\n\nY(y) = C*sin(√λy) + D*cos(√λy)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nY(0) = D = 0\nY(3) = C*sin(3√λ) = 0\n\nSince C cannot be zero, we must have sin(3√λ) = 0. This implies that √λ = mπ/3 for some integer m. Thus, λ = (mπ/3)².\n\nNow we can write the general solution for the temperature distribution function as:\n\nu(x, y) = ∑[A_mn*sin(mπx/2)*sin(nπy/3)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_mn, we use the initial temperature distribution function:\n\nf(x, y) = 20*sin(πx)*sin(πy)\n\nComparing this with the general solution, we can see that A_11 = 20. All other coefficients are zero since there are no other terms in the initial temperature distribution function that match the form of the general solution. Thus, the temperature distribution function on the plate is:\n\nu(x, y) = 20*sin(πx/2)*sin(πy/3)\n\nThis is the steady-state temperature distribution on the plate."
