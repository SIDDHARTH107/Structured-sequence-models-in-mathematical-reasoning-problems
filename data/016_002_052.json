    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by iterating the Koch curve process on each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the number of segments in the curve increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment decreases by a factor of 3.\n\nLet's denote the length of the Koch snowflake curve after the nth iteration as L_n. The length of the original equilateral triangle is L_0 = 3 units (since each side has a length of 1 unit).\n\nAfter the first iteration (n=1), the length of each side of the triangle is divided into four segments, each with a length of 1/3 units. So, the total length of the Koch snowflake curve is L_1 = 3 * 4 * (1/3) = 4 units.\n\nFor the nth iteration, the length of the Koch snowflake curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nL_n = L_0 * (4/3)^n\n\nNow, we want to find the total length of the Koch snowflake curve after the 4th iteration (n=4):\n\nL_4 = L_0 * (4/3)^4\nL_4 = 3 * (4/3)^4\nL_4 = 3 * (256/81)\nL_4 â‰ˆ 9.49 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch snowflake curve after the 4th iteration is approximately 9.49 units."
