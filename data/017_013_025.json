    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 18, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The order of a group G is 18, which can be factored as 2 * 3^2.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. If n_2 = 9, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nNext, let's find the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only possible value for n_3 is 1, so there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal.\n\nSince there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, it is normal, and we can form the semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. The Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_2, and the Sylow 3-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3.\n\nCase 1: Sylow 2-subgroup is normal (n_2 = 1)\n1. If the Sylow 3-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_9, we have the semidirect product Z_2 ⋊ Z_9. There are two possible actions of Z_2 on Z_9: the trivial action and the inversion action. The trivial action gives the direct product Z_2 × Z_9, which is isomorphic to Z_18. The inversion action gives a non-abelian group of order 18.\n2. If the Sylow 3-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3, we have the semidirect product Z_2 ⋊ (Z_3 × Z_3). There is only one non-trivial action of Z_2 on Z_3 × Z_3, which gives a non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nCase 2: Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal (n_2 = 9)\nIn this case, there is no semidirect product, and no new groups can be formed.\n\nIn total, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 18: Z_18, and two non-abelian groups."
