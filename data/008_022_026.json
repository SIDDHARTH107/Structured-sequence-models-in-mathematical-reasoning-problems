    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n```\n3x + 2y + z = 10\n6x + 4y + 2z = 20\n9x + 6y + 3z = 30.01\n```\nUsing Gaussian elimination, find the solution for `x`, `y`, and `z`. Is the matrix for this system of equations ill-conditioned?",
    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n```\n| 3  2  1 | 10\n| 6  4  2 | 20\n| 9  6  3 | 30.01\n```\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 3 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n| 1  2/3  1/3 | 10/3\n| 6  4    2   | 20\n| 9  6    3   | 30.01\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the first element in the second and third rows:\n\nSubtract 6 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n| 1  2/3  1/3 | 10/3\n| 0  0    0   | 0\n| 9  6    3   | 30.01\n```\n\nSubtract 9 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  2/3  1/3 | 10/3\n| 0  0    0   | 0\n| 0  0    0   | 0.01\n```\n\nAt this point, we can see that the second and third rows are all zeros except for the last element in the third row. This means that the system of linear equations is inconsistent and has no solution.\n\nRegarding the ill-conditioning of the matrix, let's calculate the condition number. The condition number is the ratio of the largest singular value to the smallest singular value of a matrix. A large condition number indicates that the matrix is ill-conditioned.\n\nThe original matrix A is:\n\n```\n| 3  2  1 |\n| 6  4  2 |\n| 9  6  3 |\n```\n\nThe matrix A is a rank-deficient matrix, meaning that its columns are linearly dependent. In this case, the smallest singular value is 0, which makes the condition number infinite. Therefore, the matrix is ill-conditioned."
