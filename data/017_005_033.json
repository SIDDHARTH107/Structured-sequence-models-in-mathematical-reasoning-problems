    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 125, we know that |G| = 5^3 for some prime number p = 5. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G, denoted by n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 â‰¡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 125\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G, which we will call H. Since H is unique, it is normal in G. Since |H| = 5^2 = 25, H is a group of order 25. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, H is either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_25) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5 (isomorphic to Z_5 x Z_5).\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 125 and |H| = 25, we have |G/H| = 5. Thus, G/H is a cyclic group of order 5. By the Correspondence Theorem, there exists a subgroup K of G such that K/H is isomorphic to G/H. Since G/H is cyclic, K is a cyclic group of order 5.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1. If H is cyclic (isomorphic to Z_25), then G is the internal direct product of H and K, which are both cyclic. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 125.\n\n2. If H is isomorphic to Z_5 x Z_5, then G is the internal direct product of H and K. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 (K) and a group of order 25 (H).\n\nTherefore, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
