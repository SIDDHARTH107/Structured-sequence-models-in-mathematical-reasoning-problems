    "message_2": "To approximate y(0.4) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size h = 0.2, we will perform two iterations of the method. Let's denote the function y'(x, y) as f(x, y) = y - 2x + 4.\n\nFirst iteration (x0 = 0, y0 = 1):\n\nk1 = f(x0, y0) = f(0, 1) = 1 - 2(0) + 4 = 5\nk2 = f(x0 + h/2, y0 + h*k1/2) = f(0.1, 1 + 0.2*5/2) = f(0.1, 2) = 2 - 2(0.1) + 4 = 5.8\nk3 = f(x0 + h/2, y0 + h*k2/2) = f(0.1, 1 + 0.2*5.8/2) = f(0.1, 2.58) = 2.58 - 2(0.1) + 4 = 6.36\nk4 = f(x0 + h, y0 + h*k3) = f(0.2, 1 + 0.2*6.36) = f(0.2, 2.272) = 2.272 - 2(0.2) + 4 = 6.072\n\ny1 = y0 + h*(k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)/6 = 1 + 0.2*(5 + 2*5.8 + 2*6.36 + 6.072)/6 = 2.272\n\nSecond iteration (x1 = 0.2, y1 = 2.272):\n\nk1 = f(x1, y1) = f(0.2, 2.272) = 2.272 - 2(0.2) + 4 = 6.072\nk2 = f(x1 + h/2, y1 + h*k1/2) = f(0.3, 2.272 + 0.2*6.072/2) = f(0.3, 3.3184) = 3.3184 - 2(0.3) + 4 = 6.9184\nk3 = f(x1 + h/2, y1 + h*k2/2) = f(0.3, 2.272 + 0.2*6.9184/2) = f(0.3, 3.45568) = 3.45568 - 2(0.3) + 4 = 7.11136\nk4 = f(x1 + h, y1 + h*k3) = f(0.4, 2.272 + 0.2*7.11136) = f(0.4, 3.694272) = 3.694272 - 2(0.4) + 4 = 7.194272\n\ny2 = y1 + h*(k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)/6 = 2.272 + 0.2*(6.072 + 2*6.9184 + 2*7.11136 + 7.194272)/6 ≈ 3.69427\n\nSo, the approximation of y(0.4) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size h = 0.2 is y(0.4) ≈ 3.69427."
