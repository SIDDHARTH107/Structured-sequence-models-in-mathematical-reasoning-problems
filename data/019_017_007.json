If it is false, give a counterexample.",
    "message_2": "In the standard model of arithmetic, the statement is true. Let's prove it.\n\nLet x be an even integer. By definition, an even integer can be written as x = 2k, where k is an integer. We want to find an integer y such that x + y = 10.\n\nx + y = 2k + y = 10\n\nNow, we need to solve for y:\n\ny = 10 - 2k\n\nSince k is an integer, 2k is also an integer, and 10 - 2k is an integer as well. Therefore, y is an integer. \n\nFor example, let's take x = 4 (an even integer). Then, k = 2, and y = 10 - 2k = 10 - 4 = 6, which is also an integer. Indeed, x + y = 4 + 6 = 10.\n\nSo, for every even integer x, there exists another integer y such that x + y = 10 in the standard model of arithmetic."
