    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The given system of linear equations can be represented as the following augmented matrix:\n\n[ 2  3  1 | 10 ]\n[ 4 -2  3 |  4 ]\n[ 1 -1  2 |  5 ]\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  5 ]\n[ 4 -2   3  |  4 ]\n[ 1 -1   2  |  5 ]\n\nStep 2: Subtract the first row multiplied by the appropriate constant from the other rows to eliminate the x terms:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 4 * Row 1\nRow 3 = Row 3 - Row 1\n\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  5 ]\n[ 0 -8   1  | -16 ]\n[ 0 -2.5  1.5 |  0 ]\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by -8 to get a leading 1 in the second row:\n\n[ 1  1.5  0.5 |  5 ]\n[ 0  1  -0.125 |  2 ]\n[ 0 -2.5  1.5 |  0 ]\n\nStep 4: Subtract the second row multiplied by the appropriate constant from the other rows to eliminate the y terms:\n\nRow 1 = Row 1 - 1.5 * Row 2\nRow 3 = Row 3 + 2.5 * Row 2\n\n[ 1  0  0.6875 |  2 ]\n[ 0  1 -0.125 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0  1.1875 |  5 ]\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by 1.1875 to get a leading 1 in the third row:\n\n[ 1  0  0.6875 |  2 ]\n[ 0  1 -0.125 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0  1     |  4.2105 ]\n\nStep 6: Subtract the third row multiplied by the appropriate constant from the other rows to eliminate the z terms:\n\nRow 1 = Row 1 - 0.6875 * Row 3\nRow 2 = Row 2 + 0.125 * Row 3\n\n[ 1  0  0 | -0.9453 ]\n[ 0  1  0 |  2.5263 ]\n[ 0  0  1 |  4.2105 ]\n\nNow, we can read the solution directly from the matrix:\n\nx = -0.9453\ny = 2.5263\nz = 4.2105\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately x ≈ -0.9453, y ≈ 2.5263, and z ≈ 4.2105."
