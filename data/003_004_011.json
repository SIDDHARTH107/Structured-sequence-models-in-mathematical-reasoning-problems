    "message_2": "To find all solutions of the trigonometric equation `2sin(x) = sqrt(2)` on the interval `[0, 2π)`, we first need to isolate sin(x):\n\n2sin(x) = sqrt(2)\n\nsin(x) = sqrt(2) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find all angles x in the interval `[0, 2π)` for which the sine function equals sqrt(2) / 2. We know that sin(π/4) = sqrt(2) / 2 and sin(5π/4) = sqrt(2) / 2. Therefore, the solutions of the equation on the interval `[0, 2π)` are:\n\nx = π/4 and x = 5π/4"
