    "message_2": "In an Apollonian gasket, the curvature of a circle that is tangent to three mutually tangent circles can be found using Descartes' Circle Theorem. The theorem states that if k1, k2, and k3 are the curvatures of the three mutually tangent circles, and k4 is the curvature of the fourth circle tangent to these three circles, then:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 ± 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1))^2 = k4^2\n\nIn this case, k1 = 2, k2 = 3, and k3 = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n(2 + 3 + 4 ± 2 * sqrt(2 * 3 + 3 * 4 + 4 * 2))^2 = k4^2\n\n(9 ± 2 * sqrt(6 + 12 + 8))^2 = k4^2\n\n(9 ± 2 * sqrt(26))^2 = k4^2\n\nNow, we have two possible values for k4:\n\nk4 = 9 + 2 * sqrt(26) or k4 = 9 - 2 * sqrt(26)\n\nHowever, since the curvature must be positive, we take the positive value:\n\nk4 = 9 + 2 * sqrt(26)\n\nNow, the sum of the curvatures of the three given circles and the fourth circle is:\n\nk1 + k2 + k3 + k4 = 2 + 3 + 4 + (9 + 2 * sqrt(26)) = 18 + 2 * sqrt(26)"
