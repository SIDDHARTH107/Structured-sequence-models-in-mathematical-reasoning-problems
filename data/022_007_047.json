    "message_1": "A possible numerical problem for the student to solve in complex analysis could be:\n\nSuppose that f(z) is an entire function (i.e. holomorphic on the entire complex plane) such that |f(z)| ≤ 2|z|^2 for all z. Use Liouville's theorem to prove that f(z) is a polynomial function of degree no greater than 2, and then use the fundamental theorem of algebra to determine all possible roots of f(z).\n\nNote: The theorem states that every non-zero polynomial of degree n has exactly n complex roots (counting multiplicities), so if you can show that f(z) is a polynomial of degree 2 or less, you can list its roots by solving the respective quadratic or linear equation.",
    "message_2": "First, let's use Liouville's theorem to prove that f(z) is a polynomial function of degree no greater than 2. Liouville's theorem states that every bounded entire function is constant. \n\nConsider the function g(z) = f(z) - az^2, where a is a complex constant such that |a| = 1. Then, |g(z)| = |f(z) - az^2| ≤ |f(z)| + |az^2| ≤ 2|z|^2 + |z|^2 = 3|z|^2. \n\nNow, let's examine the function h(z) = g(z)/z^2. For z ≠ 0, we have:\n\n|h(z)| = |g(z)/z^2| = |f(z) - az^2|/|z|^2 ≤ 3.\n\nThis shows that h(z) is bounded for z ≠ 0. Since f(z) is entire, g(z) and h(z) are also entire. Moreover, h(z) has a removable singularity at z = 0, so we can define h(0) to make h(z) entire and bounded. By Liouville's theorem, h(z) must be constant, say h(z) = c.\n\nNow we have g(z) = c * z^2, and f(z) = az^2 + c * z^2 = (a + c)z^2. This shows that f(z) is a polynomial function of degree no greater than 2.\n\nNext, let's use the fundamental theorem of algebra to determine all possible roots of f(z). The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-zero polynomial of degree n has exactly n complex roots (counting multiplicities). Since f(z) is a polynomial of degree 2, it has exactly two complex roots.\n\nLet f(z) = (a + c)z^2. To find the roots, we set f(z) = 0 and solve for z:\n\n(a + c)z^2 = 0.\n\nSince a + c ≠ 0 (otherwise f(z) would be identically zero, which contradicts the given condition), we can divide both sides by a + c:\n\nz^2 = 0.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find that z = 0 is the only root of f(z), with multiplicity 2."
