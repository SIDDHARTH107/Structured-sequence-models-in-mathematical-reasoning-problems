    "message_1": "Suppose that in a certain company, the probability of an employee committing financial fraud is 0.02. If the company employs 250 people, what is the probability that at least 5 employees are involved in financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k employees committing financial fraud, C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, n is the total number of employees (250 in this case), k is the number of employees committing financial fraud, and p is the probability of an employee committing financial fraud (0.02 in this case).\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of at least 5 employees committing financial fraud, which means we need to find the probability of 5, 6, 7, ..., 250 employees committing financial fraud and sum those probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 employees committing financial fraud and subtract that from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 employees committing financial fraud. This method requires fewer calculations.\n\nSo, we need to find P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) and subtract that from 1.\n\nP(X = 0) = C(250, 0) * (0.02)^0 * (1-0.02)^(250-0) = 1 * 1 * (0.98)^250 ≈ 0.0000454\nP(X = 1) = C(250, 1) * (0.02)^1 * (1-0.02)^(250-1) ≈ 0.000567\nP(X = 2) = C(250, 2) * (0.02)^2 * (1-0.02)^(250-2) ≈ 0.00338\nP(X = 3) = C(250, 3) * (0.02)^3 * (1-0.02)^(250-3) ≈ 0.0113\nP(X = 4) = C(250, 4) * (0.02)^4 * (1-0.02)^(250-4) ≈ 0.0253\n\nNow, sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 4) = 0.0000454 + 0.000567 + 0.00338 + 0.0113 + 0.0253 ≈ 0.0406\n\nFinally, subtract this sum from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 employees committing financial fraud:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X ≤ 4) = 1 - 0.0406 ≈ 0.9594\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 employees are involved in financial fraud is approximately 0.9594 or 95.94%."
