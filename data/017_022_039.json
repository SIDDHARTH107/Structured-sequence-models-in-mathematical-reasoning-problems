    "message_2": "A group of order 60 has a prime factorization of 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we can use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is based on the prime factorization of the order and the number of partitions of the exponents.\n\nFor a group of order 60, the prime factorization is 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1. The number of partitions for each exponent is:\n\n- For 2: (2) and (1,1) - 2 partitions\n- For 1 (both 3 and 5 have exponent 1): (1) - 1 partition\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the number of groups of a given order:\n\nNumber of groups = (number of partitions of exponent of 2) * (number of partitions of exponent of 3) * (number of partitions of exponent of 5)\n\nNumber of groups = 2 * 1 * 1 = 2\n\nSo, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 60.\n\nTo determine how many of these groups are abelian, we can use the fact that a group is abelian if and only if its exponent partitions are all singletons (i.e., have only one part). In this case, there is only one such partition for each prime factor:\n\n- For 2: (2)\n- For 3: (1)\n- For 5: (1)\n\nThus, there is only 1 abelian group of order 60, which is the direct product of the cyclic groups of orders 2^2, 3^1, and 5^1, or Z_4 x Z_3 x Z_5."
