    "message_2": "To find the number of nodes of the curve X, we first need to find the singular points of the curve. A singular point is a point where both the partial derivatives with respect to x and y are zero. The given equation is:\n\ny^2 = x^3 - 3x + 2\n\nLet's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n\nNow we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n3x^2 - 3 = 0\n2y = 0\n\nThe first equation simplifies to x^2 = 1, which has two solutions: x = 1 and x = -1. The second equation gives y = 0. So, we have two potential singular points: (1, 0) and (-1, 0).\n\nNow we need to check if these points are actually singular points by computing the discriminant of the curve at these points. The discriminant is given by:\n\nΔ = -16(4a^3c - b^2c^2 - 128d^5 + 144a^2d^2 - 27a^4)\n\nFor our curve, a = 1, b = 0, c = -3, and d = 2. Plugging these values into the discriminant formula, we get:\n\nΔ = -16(4(1)(-3) - 0 - 128(2)^5 + 144(1)^2(2)^2 - 27(1)^4)\nΔ = -16(-12 - 0 - 2048 + 576 - 27)\nΔ = -16(-12 - 1471)\nΔ = -16(-1483)\nΔ ≠ 0\n\nSince the discriminant is not zero, both (1, 0) and (-1, 0) are singular points, and they are nodes. Therefore, the curve X has 2 nodes."
