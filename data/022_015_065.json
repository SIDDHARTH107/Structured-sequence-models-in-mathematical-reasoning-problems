    "message_2": "To find the image of the unit circle under the map $f(z)=\\frac{1+z}{1-z}$, we first need to rewrite the equation of the unit circle in terms of $z$ and its conjugate $\\bar{z}$. The equation of the unit circle is given by $|z|=1$, which can be written as $z\\bar{z}=1$.\n\nNow, let's apply the map $f(z)$ to the unit circle. We have:\n\n$$f(z)=\\frac{1+z}{1-z}$$\n\nWe want to find the image of the unit circle under this map, so we want to find the equation of the curve in the $w$-plane, where $w=f(z)$. To do this, we will eliminate $z$ from the equation by expressing $z$ in terms of $w$. \n\nFirst, let's solve for $z$:\n\n$$z = \\frac{w-1}{w+1}$$\n\nNow, let's find the conjugate of $z$, denoted by $\\bar{z}$:\n\n$$\\bar{z} = \\frac{\\bar{w}-1}{\\bar{w}+1}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $z$ and $\\bar{z}$ into the equation of the unit circle, $z\\bar{z}=1$:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{w-1}{w+1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\bar{w}-1}{\\bar{w}+1}\\right) = 1$$\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation:\n\n$$\\frac{(w-1)(\\bar{w}-1)}{(w+1)(\\bar{w}+1)} = 1$$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n$$(w-1)(\\bar{w}-1) = (w+1)(\\bar{w}+1)$$\n\nExpanding both sides, we have:\n\n$$w\\bar{w} - w - \\bar{w} + 1 = w\\bar{w} + w + \\bar{w} + 1$$\n\nNow, we can simplify further by subtracting $w\\bar{w}+1$ from both sides:\n\n$$-w - \\bar{w} = w + \\bar{w}$$\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$$2w + 2\\bar{w} = 0$$\n\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\n$$w + \\bar{w} = 0$$\n\nThis is the equation of the image of the unit circle under the map $f(z)$. This equation represents a vertical line in the complex plane, with the real part of $w$ being zero. Therefore, the image of the unit circle under the map $f(z)$ is the imaginary axis."
