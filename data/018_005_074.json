    "message_2": "To find the intersection of A and its complement, we first need to determine the complement of A with respect to the universal set U. The complement of A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, we find the intersection of A and A', which means we are looking for elements that are common to both sets. However, by definition, the complement of A contains elements that are not in A. Therefore, there are no common elements between A and A'.\n\nThe intersection of A and its complement A' is an empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}.\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅ or {}"
