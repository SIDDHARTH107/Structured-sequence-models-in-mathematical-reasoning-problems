    "message_2": "To find the probability that a new car will survive beyond 10 years on the road, we need to plug in t = 10 into the survival function S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ = 0.05.\n\nS(10) = e^(-0.05 * 10)\n\nS(10) = e^(-0.5)\n\nS(10) ≈ 0.6065\n\nSo, the probability that a new car will survive beyond 10 years on the road is approximately 0.6065 or 60.65%."
