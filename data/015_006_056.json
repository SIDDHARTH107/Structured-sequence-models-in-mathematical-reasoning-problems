    "message_2": "To find the fixed points of the Hénon map, we need to find the points (x, y) for which x_(n+1) = x_n and y_(n+1) = y_n. In other words, we need to find the points (x, y) that satisfy the following equations:\n\nx = 1 - a * x^2 + y\ny = b * x\n\nSubstitute the given values of a and b:\n\nx = 1 - 1.4 * x^2 + y\ny = 0.3 * x\n\nNow we can solve this system of equations. First, we can express y in terms of x using the second equation:\n\ny = 0.3 * x\n\nNow substitute this expression for y in the first equation:\n\nx = 1 - 1.4 * x^2 + 0.3 * x\n\nRearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation in x:\n\n1.4 * x^2 - 0.3 * x + x - 1 = 0\n1.4 * x^2 + 0.7 * x - 1 = 0\n\nNow we can solve this quadratic equation for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-B ± √(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n\nwhere A = 1.4, B = 0.7, and C = -1:\n\nx = (-0.7 ± √(0.7^2 - 4 * 1.4 * (-1))) / (2 * 1.4)\n\nx = (-0.7 ± √(2.45)) / 2.8\n\nNow we have two possible values for x:\n\nx1 = (-0.7 + √(2.45)) / 2.8\nx2 = (-0.7 - √(2.45)) / 2.8\n\nFor each of these x values, we can find the corresponding y values using the equation y = 0.3 * x:\n\ny1 = 0.3 * x1\ny2 = 0.3 * x2\n\nSo the fixed points of the Hénon map are:\n\n(x1, y1) = ((-0.7 + √(2.45)) / 2.8, 0.3 * x1)\n(x2, y2) = ((-0.7 - √(2.45)) / 2.8, 0.3 * x2)"
