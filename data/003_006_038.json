    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side of the triangle, we will use the Law of Cosines instead of the Law of Sines, since we have the included angle and the lengths of the two sides adjacent to it.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and the angle C between sides a and b:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, a = 5, b = 8, and C = 40 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (40 * π) / 180 ≈ 0.698 radians\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side (c):\n\nc² = 5² + 8² - 2 * 5 * 8 * cos(0.698)\nc² = 25 + 64 - 80 * cos(0.698)\nc² ≈ 25 + 64 - 80 * 0.766\nc² ≈ 89 - 61.28\nc² ≈ 27.72\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc ≈ √27.72\nc ≈ 5.26\n\nSo, the length of the third side of the triangle is approximately 5.26 units."
