    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least two tails when flipping a fair coin three times in a row, we can first find the probability of the complementary event (getting fewer than two tails) and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThere are two possibilities for getting fewer than two tails:\n1. Getting exactly one tail (THT, HTH, or THH)\n2. Getting no tails (HHH)\n\nThe probability of each of these outcomes is (1/2)^3 = 1/8. There are 3 outcomes with exactly one tail and 1 outcome with no tails, so the probability of getting fewer than two tails is (3+1)/8 = 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nNow, to find the probability of getting at least two tails, we subtract the probability of getting fewer than two tails from 1:\n\n1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nSo the probability of getting at least two tails when flipping a fair coin three times in a row is 1/2 or 50%."
