    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces batteries with a mean lifespan of 1800 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. If a sample of 49 batteries is randomly selected, what is the probability that the mean lifespan of those batteries is less than 1750 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, we are given the population mean (μ) as 1800 hours and the population standard deviation (σ) as 100 hours. We are also given a sample size (n) of 49 batteries.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σx̄), which is calculated as:\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n\n\nσx̄ = 100 / √49\n\nσx̄ = 100 / 7\n\nσx̄ = 14.29 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 1750 hours. The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / σx̄\n\nz = (1750 - 1800) / 14.29\n\nz = -50 / 14.29\n\nz = -3.5\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can find the probability that the sample mean is less than 1750 hours by looking up the z-score in a standard normal distribution table or using a calculator with a normal distribution function.\n\nThe probability for a z-score of -3.5 is approximately 0.0002 or 0.02%.\n\nSo, there is a 0.02% chance that the mean lifespan of the 49 randomly selected batteries is less than 1750 hours."
