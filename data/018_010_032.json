    "message_2": "To prove that (A x B) ∪ (A x C) = A x (B ∪ C) for any set C, we will first define the Cartesian product and the distributivity of union.\n\nThe Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. In other words, A x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}.\n\nThe distributivity of union states that for any sets A, B, and C, A ∪ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ B) ∪ (A ∪ C).\n\nNow, let's prove that (A x B) ∪ (A x C) = A x (B ∪ C) for any set C.\n\n1. (A x B) ∪ (A x C) = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B} ∪ {(a, c) | a ∈ A, c ∈ C}\n2. = {(a, x) | a ∈ A, x ∈ B ∪ C} (by definition of union)\n3. = A x (B ∪ C) (by definition of Cartesian product)\n\nThus, we have shown that (A x B) ∪ (A x C) = A x (B ∪ C) for any set C."
