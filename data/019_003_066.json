    "message_2": "To determine whether the formula ◊(p ∧ q) → (◊p ∧ ◊q) is valid or not, we need to check if the formula is true in all possible worlds.\n\nLet's break down the formula:\n\n1. ◊(p ∧ q): There exists a possible world where both p and q are true.\n2. ◊p: There exists a possible world where p is true.\n3. ◊q: There exists a possible world where q is true.\n4. (◊p ∧ ◊q): There exists a possible world where p is true and there exists a possible world where q is true.\n\nNow let's evaluate the formula in each world:\n\nAt world w1:\n1. p ∧ q = True ∧ False = False\n2. ◊(p ∧ q) = False (since p ∧ q is not true in any world)\n3. ◊p = True (since p is true in w1 and w3)\n4. ◊q = True (since q is true in w2 and w3)\n5. (◊p ∧ ◊q) = True ∧ True = True\n6. ◊(p ∧ q) → (◊p ∧ ◊q) = False → True = True\n\nAt world w2:\n1. p ∧ q = False ∧ True = False\n2. ◊(p ∧ q) = False (since p ∧ q is not true in any world)\n3. ◊p = True (since p is true in w1 and w3)\n4. ◊q = True (since q is true in w2 and w3)\n5. (◊p ∧ ◊q) = True ∧ True = True\n6. ◊(p ∧ q) → (◊p ∧ ◊q) = False → True = True\n\nAt world w3:\n1. p ∧ q = True ∧ True = True\n2. ◊(p ∧ q) = True (since p ∧ q is true in w3)\n3. ◊p = True (since p is true in w1 and w3)\n4. ◊q = True (since q is true in w2 and w3)\n5. (◊p ∧ ◊q) = True ∧ True = True\n6. ◊(p ∧ q) → (◊p ∧ ◊q) = True → True = True\n\nSince the formula ◊(p ∧ q) → (◊p ∧ ◊q) is true in all possible worlds (w1, w2, and w3), the formula is valid."
