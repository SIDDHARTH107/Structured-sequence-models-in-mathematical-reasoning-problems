    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid, we will use the method of disks (also known as the disk method). The volume of a solid formed by revolving a region around a line is given by the integral of the area of the cross-sectional disks.\n\nIn this case, the region is bounded by the curve y = x^2 and the x-axis, and it is revolved around the line y = -1. The radius of each disk is given by the distance between the curve y = x^2 and the line y = -1. This distance is (x^2 - (-1)) = x^2 + 1.\n\nThe area of each disk is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius. In this case, A = π(x^2 + 1)^2.\n\nNow, we need to find the limits of integration. The region is bounded by the x-axis, so we need to find the points where the curve y = x^2 intersects the x-axis. This occurs when y = 0, so:\n\n0 = x^2\nx = ±√0\nx = 0\n\nSince the region is symmetric about the y-axis, we can integrate from -x to x and then multiply the result by 2. So, the volume V of the solid is given by:\n\nV = 2 * ∫[A(x) dx] from -x to x\nV = 2 * ∫[π(x^2 + 1)^2 dx] from -x to x\n\nNow, we need to integrate the function and evaluate it at the limits of integration:\n\nV = 2 * [π∫(x^4 + 2x^2 + 1) dx] from -x to x\nV = 2 * [π(1/5x^5 + 2/3x^3 + x)] from -x to x\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nV = 2 * [π((1/5x^5 + 2/3x^3 + x) - (1/5(-x)^5 + 2/3(-x)^3 + (-x)))]\nV = 2 * [π((1/5x^5 + 2/3x^3 + x) - (-1/5x^5 + 2/3x^3 - x))]\nV = 2 * [π(2/5x^5 + 4/3x^3 + 2x)]\n\nSince the region is symmetric about the y-axis, we can integrate from 0 to x and then multiply the result by 2:\n\nV = 4 * [π(1/5x^5 + 2/3x^3 + x)] from 0 to x\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nV = 4 * [π((1/5x^5 + 2/3x^3 + x) - (1/5(0)^5 + 2/3(0)^3 + (0)))]\nV = 4 * [π(1/5x^5 + 2/3x^3 + x)]\n\nSince x = 0, the volume of the solid is:\n\nV = 4 * [π(1/5(0)^5 + 2/3(0)^3 + (0))]\nV = 0\n\nThe volume of the solid formed by revolving the region bounded by the curve y = x^2 and the x-axis about the line y = -1 is 0."
