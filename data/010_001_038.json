The set {1, 2, 3} is closed in X.\n3. The set {3} is neither open nor closed in X.\n\nNote: For a set to be open in a topology, it has to be a member of the topology. For a set to be closed in a topology, its complement must be open.",
    "message_2": "1. The set {2} is open in X.\nFalse. The set {2} is not a member of the topology 𝑇, so it is not open in X.\n\n2. The set {1, 2, 3} is closed in X.\nTrue. The complement of {1, 2, 3} is {4}, and the set {4} can be expressed as the difference between two sets in 𝑇: {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1, 2} = {4}. Since the complement is open, the set {1, 2, 3} is closed in X.\n\n3. The set {3} is neither open nor closed in X.\nTrue. The set {3} is not a member of the topology 𝑇, so it is not open in X. The complement of {3} is {1, 2, 4}, which cannot be expressed as a union or difference of sets in 𝑇, so its complement is not open, and the set {3} is not closed in X. Therefore, the set {3} is neither open nor closed in X."
