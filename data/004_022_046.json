Find the dimensions of the garden with maximum area that can be enclosed using 200 feet of fence.\n\n(Note: Please refer to the image here: https://i.imgur.com/5ctzYBk.png for a better understanding of the problem)",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the garden parallel to the building as x and the width of the garden perpendicular to the building as y. Since the fence is used on three sides, we can write the constraint equation as:\n\nx + 2y = 200\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the garden and maximize it. The area A can be written as:\n\nA = xy\n\nWe can solve the constraint equation for x and substitute it into the area equation:\n\nx = 200 - 2y\n\nA = (200 - 2y)y = 200y - 2y^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to y and set it equal to zero:\n\ndA/dy = 200 - 4y = 0\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\n4y = 200\ny = 50\n\nNow, we can plug this value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 200 - 2(50) = 100\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden with the maximum area are 100 feet by 50 feet."
