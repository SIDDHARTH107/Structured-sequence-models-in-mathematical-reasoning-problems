    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer wants to maximize profits by producing two types of bookshelves: a small one that sells for $80 and a large one that sells for $120. Each small bookshelf requires 4 units of wood and 2 hours of labor to produce, while each large bookshelf requires 8 units of wood and 4 hours of labor. The manufacturer has 60 units of wood and 32 hours of labor available for production. How many of each type of bookshelf should the manufacturer produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of small bookshelves and y be the number of large bookshelves.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are:\n1. Wood constraint: 4x + 8y ≤ 60\n2. Labor constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 32\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: P(x, y) = 80x + 120y\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n1. Wood constraint: 4x + 8y ≤ 60\nDivide both sides by 4: x + 2y ≤ 15\n\n2. Labor constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 32\nDivide both sides by 2: x + 2y ≤ 16\n\nNow, we will graph the constraints and find the feasible region:\n\n1. x + 2y ≤ 15\nWhen x = 0, y = 7.5\nWhen y = 0, x = 15\n\n2. x + 2y ≤ 16\nWhen x = 0, y = 8\nWhen y = 0, x = 16\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 7.5), (15, 0), and (8, 4).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 80x + 120y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 80(0) + 120(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 7.5) = 80(0) + 120(7.5) = $900\n3. P(15, 0) = 80(15) + 120(0) = $1200\n4. P(8, 4) = 80(8) + 120(4) = $1280\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the manufacturer produces 8 small bookshelves and 4 large bookshelves, resulting in a profit of $1280."
