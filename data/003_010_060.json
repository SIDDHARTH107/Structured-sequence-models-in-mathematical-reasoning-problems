    "message_1": "A flagpole stands on level ground such that the angle of elevation of the top of the pole from a point 25 meters away from its base is 37°. Find the height of the flagpole.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 37°, the side opposite the angle is the height of the flagpole (which we want to find), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the point to the base of the flagpole, which is 25 meters.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(37°) = height / 25\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 25:\n\nheight = 25 * tan(37°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 37°:\n\ntan(37°) ≈ 0.7536\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into the equation:\n\nheight ≈ 25 * 0.7536\n\nheight ≈ 18.84 meters\n\nSo, the height of the flagpole is approximately 18.84 meters."
