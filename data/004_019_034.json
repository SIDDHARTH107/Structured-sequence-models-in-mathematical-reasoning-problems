    "message_2": "To determine the velocity of the car after 10 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (0 m/s since the car starts from rest), a is the acceleration (4 m/s^2), and t is the time (10 seconds).\n\nv = 0 + (4 m/s^2)(10 s)\nv = 40 m/s\n\nSo, the velocity of the car after 10 seconds is 40 m/s.\n\nTo determine the displacement traveled during this time, we can use the formula:\n\ns = ut + (1/2)at^2\n\nwhere s is the displacement, u is the initial velocity (0 m/s), a is the acceleration (4 m/s^2), and t is the time (10 seconds).\n\ns = (0 m/s)(10 s) + (1/2)(4 m/s^2)(10 s)^2\ns = 0 + (1/2)(4 m/s^2)(100 s^2)\ns = (2 m/s^2)(100 s^2)\ns = 200 m\n\nSo, the displacement traveled during this time is 200 meters."
