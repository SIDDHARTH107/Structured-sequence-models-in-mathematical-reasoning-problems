    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nTo find φ(15), we need to find the number of positive integers less than or equal to 15 that are relatively prime to 15. Since 15 = 3 × 5, we can use the formula for the totient function of a product of two distinct prime numbers:\n\nφ(n) = φ(p × q) = (p - 1)(q - 1)\n\nwhere p and q are distinct prime numbers.\n\nIn this case, p = 3 and q = 5, so:\n\nφ(15) = φ(3 × 5) = (3 - 1)(5 - 1) = 2 × 4 = 8\n\nSo, φ(15) = 8. There are 8 positive integers less than or equal to 15 that are relatively prime to 15: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14."
