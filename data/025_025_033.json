    "message_2": "To determine if the two-sided ideal $I$ is prime, we need to check if the following condition holds: for any two elements $a, b \\in \\mathbb{C}\\langle x, y \\rangle$, if $ab \\in I$, then either $a \\in I$ or $b \\in I$.\n\nLet's first rewrite the generators of $I$ as $x^2 - yx - 1 = 0$ and $y^2 - xy + 1 = 0$. We can rewrite these equations as $x^2 = yx + 1$ and $y^2 = xy - 1$.\n\nNow, consider the product $ab = (yx + 1)(xy - 1)$. Expanding this product, we get:\n\n$ab = y^2x^2 - yx + xy^2 - 1$.\n\nUsing the relations $x^2 = yx + 1$ and $y^2 = xy - 1$, we can substitute and simplify:\n\n$ab = (xy - 1)x^2 - yx + x(yx + 1) - 1 = (xy - 1)(yx + 1) - yx + xyx + x - 1$.\n\nNow, we can rearrange and simplify:\n\n$ab = xyx - yx^2 + x^2y - yx + xyx + x - 1 = x(yx - x^2) + (x^2y - yx) + x - 1$.\n\nUsing the relations $x^2 = yx + 1$ and $y^2 = xy - 1$ again, we can substitute and simplify:\n\n$ab = x(1 - yx) + (1 - xy) + x - 1 = -x^2y + x + yx - xy + x - 1$.\n\nNow, we can rearrange and simplify:\n\n$ab = -x^2y + yx + x - xy + x - 1 = -(x^2 - yx - 1) + (y^2 - xy + 1) - 1$.\n\nThus, we have $ab = -(x^2 - yx - 1) + (y^2 - xy + 1) - 1 \\in I$. However, neither $a = yx + 1$ nor $b = xy - 1$ are in $I$, since they are not multiples of the generators $x^2 - yx - 1$ and $y^2 - xy + 1$. This contradicts the condition for $I$ to be a prime ideal.\n\nTherefore, the two-sided ideal $I$ is not a prime ideal."
