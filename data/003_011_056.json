    "message_1": "A 30-meter long ladder is resting against a wall. The foot of the ladder is 15 meters from the base of the wall. What is the height where the ladder touches the wall, to the nearest meter, assuming the ladder is perpendicular to the wall?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the ladder forms a right-angled triangle with the wall and the ground. The ladder is the hypotenuse with a length of 30 meters, and the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall is one of the other sides with a length of 15 meters. Let's denote the height where the ladder touches the wall as h.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n30^2 = 15^2 + h^2\n\n900 = 225 + h^2\n\nSubtract 225 from both sides:\n\n675 = h^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nh = √675 ≈ 25.98\n\nTo the nearest meter, the height where the ladder touches the wall is approximately 26 meters."
