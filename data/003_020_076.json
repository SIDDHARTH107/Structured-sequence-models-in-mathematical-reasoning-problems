    "message_1": "A 30-foot ladder is placed against a wall so that it reaches a height of 24 feet. What is the angle of elevation of the ladder? Round your answer to the nearest degree.",
    "message_2": "We can use the trigonometric function cosine to solve this problem. The angle of elevation (θ) can be found using the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this case, the adjacent side is the height of the wall (24 feet) and the hypotenuse is the length of the ladder (30 feet).\n\ncos(θ) = 24 / 30\ncos(θ) = 0.8\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse cosine (also known as arccos) of 0.8 to find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(0.8)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nθ ≈ 36.87 degrees\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle of elevation of the ladder is approximately 37 degrees."
