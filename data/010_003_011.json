Let $A$ be a closed subset of $X$ and $p\\notin A$. Prove that there exist open sets $U,V\\subseteq X$ such that $p\\in U$, $A\\subseteq V$, and $U\\cap V=\\varnothing$. \n\nFor a concrete example, let $X=[0,1]\\cup [2,3]$ with the subspace topology inherited from the Euclidean topology. Let $A=[0,1]$ and $p=2.5$. Find the required open sets $U$ and $V$ in this case.",
    "message_2": "To prove the general case, we will use the $T_1$ axiom. Since $p \\notin A$, $p$ is distinct from every point in $A$. For each $a \\in A$, there exist open sets $U_a, V_a \\subseteq X$ such that $p \\in U_a$, $a \\in V_a$, and $U_a \\cap V_a = \\varnothing$. Now, consider the open set $U = \\bigcap_{a \\in A} U_a$. Since $p \\in U_a$ for all $a \\in A$, we have $p \\in U$. \n\nNext, let $V = \\bigcup_{a \\in A} V_a$. Since $a \\in V_a$ for all $a \\in A$, we have $A \\subseteq V$. Now, we need to show that $U \\cap V = \\varnothing$. Suppose there exists a point $x \\in U \\cap V$. Then, $x \\in U$ and $x \\in V$. Since $x \\in V$, there exists some $a \\in A$ such that $x \\in V_a$. But since $x \\in U$, we have $x \\in U_a$ as well, which contradicts the fact that $U_a \\cap V_a = \\varnothing$. Therefore, $U \\cap V = \\varnothing$.\n\nNow, let's consider the concrete example with $X = [0, 1] \\cup [2, 3]$, $A = [0, 1]$, and $p = 2.5$. We can choose the open sets $U = (2, 3)$ and $V = [0, 1] \\cup (2, 2.5)$. Clearly, $p \\in U$, $A \\subseteq V$, and $U \\cap V = \\varnothing$."
