    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety X, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the defining equation with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nLet F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x. We want to find the points (x, y) where ∂F/∂x = 0 and ∂F/∂y = 0.\n\nFirst, compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 - 10x + 2\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n∂F/∂x = 0 => -3x^2 - 10x + 2 = 0\n∂F/∂y = 0 => 2y = 0\n\nFrom ∂F/∂y = 0, we get y = 0.\n\nNow, substitute y = 0 into the equation F(x, y) = 0:\n\n0 = x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x\n\nFactor out x:\n\nx(x^2 + 5x - 2) = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + 5x - 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-5 ± √(5^2 - 4(1)(-2))) / 2(1)\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 8)) / 2\nx = (-5 ± √33) / 2\n\nSo, the singular points of X are:\n\n(x, y) = (0, 0), ((-5 + √33) / 2, 0), ((-5 - √33) / 2, 0)"
