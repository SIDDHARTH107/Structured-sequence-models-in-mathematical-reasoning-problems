    "message_1": "Sorry, I can't provide a precise numerical problem since Non-monotonic logic does not deal with numerical calculations. Non-monotonic logic refers to reasoning where the conclusions may be withdrawn when new information is added to the system. Instead, I can suggest a question related to Non-monotonic logic.\n\nQuestion: Explain the difference between monotonic and non-monotonic logic, and provide a real-world example of a situation where non-monotonic logic might be used.",
    "message_2": "Answer: The main difference between monotonic and non-monotonic logic lies in how they handle new information added to a system.\n\nIn monotonic logic, once a conclusion is derived from a set of premises, it remains valid even when new information is added to the system. In other words, the set of conclusions only grows or remains the same as new premises are introduced. Monotonic logic is commonly used in classical logic and mathematics.\n\nOn the other hand, non-monotonic logic allows for conclusions to be withdrawn or revised when new information is added to the system. This type of logic is more flexible and better suited for handling situations where information is incomplete or uncertain. Non-monotonic logic is often used in artificial intelligence, expert systems, and commonsense reasoning.\n\nReal-world example: Consider a medical diagnosis system that uses non-monotonic logic. Initially, based on a patient's symptoms (e.g., fever and cough), the system may conclude that the patient has a common cold. However, when new information is added (e.g., the patient has recently traveled to a region with a high risk of a specific disease), the system may revise its conclusion and suggest that the patient might have that specific disease instead. This ability to revise conclusions based on new information is a key feature of non-monotonic logic."
