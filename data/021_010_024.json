    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x + 5 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the first derivative is equal to zero or undefined.\n\n1. Find the first derivative of the function:\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 24x + 36\n\n2. Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n3x^2 - 24x + 36 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3:\nx^2 - 8x + 12 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n(x - 6)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSolve for x:\nx = 6, 2\n\n3. Apply Newton's method to find the minimum value:\nNewton's method formula: x_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nFind the second derivative of the function:\nf''(x) = 6x - 24\n\nChoose one of the critical points (x = 6 or x = 2) as the initial guess (x_0). We'll choose x = 6:\nx_0 = 6\n\nApply Newton's method iteratively until convergence (i.e., when the difference between consecutive x values is very small or negligible):\n\nx_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0)\nx_1 = 6 - (3(6)^2 - 24(6) + 36) / (6(6) - 24)\nx_1 = 6 - (108 - 144 + 36) / (36 - 24)\nx_1 = 6 - (0) / (12)\nx_1 = 6\n\nSince x_1 = x_0, the method has converged, and the minimum value occurs at x = 6.\n\n4. Find the minimum value of the function by plugging the x value into the original function:\nf(6) = (6)^3 - 12(6)^2 + 36(6) + 5\nf(6) = 216 - 432 + 216 + 5\nf(6) = 5\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 12x^2 + 36x + 5 is 5."
