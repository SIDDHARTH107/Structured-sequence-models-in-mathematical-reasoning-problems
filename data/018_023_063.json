    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A △ B) and B, denoted as (A △ B) △ B.\n\n(A △ B) △ B = ({1, 4} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4}) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {4} = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and B, denoted as B △ B.\n\nB △ B = (B ∪ B) - (B ∩ B) = {2, 3, 4} - {2, 3, 4} = {}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and the empty set, denoted as A △ (B △ B).\n\nA △ (B △ B) = (A ∪ {}) - (A ∩ {}) = {1, 2, 3} - {} = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNow, we will find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) △ B and A △ (B △ B).\n\n((A △ B) △ B) × (A △ (B △ B)) = {1, 2, 3} × {1, 2, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A △ (B △ B) and (A △ B) △ B.\n\n(A △ (B △ B)) × ((A △ B) △ B) = {1, 2, 3} × {1, 2, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nSince the Cartesian products are equal, we have:\n\n((A △ B) △ B) × (A △ (B △ B)) = (A △ (B △ B)) × ((A △ B) △ B)\n\nHowever, this does not prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product, as the original statement requested. In fact, the results show that the Cartesian products are equal in this specific case."
