    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal number of units to produce. Let's denote the number of units produced as x.\n\nThe profit function can be defined as:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue = Selling price per unit * Number of units sold = $10 * x\nCost = Production cost per unit * Number of units produced = $5 * x\n\nSo, the profit function is:\n\nProfit(x) = 10x - 5x = 5x\n\nSince the company can only produce up to 1000 units and must use at least 200 units of a specific machine, the possible range for x is between 200 and 1000.\n\nNow, let's analyze the profit function:\n\nThe profit function is a linear function with a positive slope (5), which means that the profit will increase as the number of units produced increases. Therefore, to maximize the profit, the company should produce the maximum number of units allowed, which is 1000 units."
