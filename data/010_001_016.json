    "message_2": "To determine whether the subsets A, B, and C are open, closed, or neither, we need to examine the topology T.\n\nRecall that a subset of a topological space is open if it is an element of the topology, and it is closed if its complement is open.\n\nA = {1}: Since {1} is an element of the topology T, A is open. The complement of A is X - A = {2}, which is also an element of T. Therefore, A is also closed.\n\nB = {2}: Since {2} is an element of the topology T, B is open. The complement of B is X - B = {1}, which is also an element of T. Therefore, B is also closed.\n\nC = {1,2}: Since {1,2} is an element of the topology T, C is open. The complement of C is X - C = {}, which is also an element of T (the empty set is always an element of a topology). Therefore, C is also closed.\n\nIn conclusion, all three subsets A, B, and C are both open and closed in the topological space X with topology T."
