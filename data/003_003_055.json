    "message_2": "To find the sine of 60 degrees using the unit circle, we can use the coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle. \n\nFor a 60-degree angle, the coordinates of the point on the unit circle are (1/2, √3/2). The sine of the angle is equal to the y-coordinate of this point.\n\nSo, the sine of 60 degrees is √3/2 or approximately 0.866."
