    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation log₂(x - 3) + log₂(x) = 3, we can use the properties of logarithms to combine the two logarithms on the left side of the equation.\n\nProperty: logₐ(x) + logₐ(y) = logₐ(xy)\n\nApplying this property, we get:\n\nlog₂((x - 3)x) = 3\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n2^3 = (x - 3)x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n8 = x^2 - 3x\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 3x - 8 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve the quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. In this case, we can factor the equation:\n\n(x - 4)(x + 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx - 4 = 0 => x = 4\nx + 2 = 0 => x = -2\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with logarithms, we need to check if these solutions are valid (i.e., the argument of the logarithm must be positive). Let's check both solutions:\n\nFor x = 4:\nlog₂(4 - 3) + log₂(4) = log₂(1) + log₂(4) = 0 + 2 = 3 (valid)\n\nFor x = -2:\nlog₂(-2 - 3) + log₂(-2) => log₂(-5) + log₂(-2) (invalid, since the argument of the logarithm is negative)\n\nSo, the only valid solution is x = 4."
