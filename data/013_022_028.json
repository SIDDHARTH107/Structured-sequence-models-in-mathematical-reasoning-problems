    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player 1 is given 10 tokens and must decide how many tokens, if any, to give to Player 2. If Player 1 gives all 10 tokens, then Player 2 has a total of 20 tokens. If Player 1 gives none, then Player 2 has 10 tokens. What is the Nash equilibrium for this game? What is the payoff for each player in this equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "In a Dictator Game, there is no strategic interaction between the players, as Player 2 has no decision-making power. Therefore, the concept of Nash equilibrium does not apply to this game.\n\nHowever, if we assume that Player 1 is purely self-interested and wants to maximize their own payoff, they would choose to give 0 tokens to Player 2. In this case, the payoff for Player 1 would be 10 tokens, and the payoff for Player 2 would be 10 tokens (as stated in the problem). This can be considered as a stable outcome, but it is not a Nash equilibrium in the traditional sense since Player 2 has no strategic choices to make."
