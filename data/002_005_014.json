    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which is given by:\n\nDiagonal length = √(length² + width² + height²)\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm, the width is 5 cm, and the height is 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nDiagonal length = √(8² + 5² + 3²) = √(64 + 25 + 9) = √98\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √98 cm, which is approximately 9.9 cm."
