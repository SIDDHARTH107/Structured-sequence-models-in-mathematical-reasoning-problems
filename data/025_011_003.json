    "message_2": "To compute the order of the group of points of $E$ over $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$, we need to find all the points on the curve $y^2 = x^3 + 1$ with coordinates in $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$. We will do this by checking all possible values of $x$ and $y$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$, which are $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nFor each value of $x$, we will compute the right-hand side of the equation, $x^3 + 1$, and check if there is a corresponding value of $y$ such that $y^2$ is equal to the computed value. If there is, we have a point on the curve.\n\n1. For $x = 0$, we have $x^3 + 1 = 0^3 + 1 = 1$. The possible values of $y^2$ are $0^2 = 0$, $1^2 = 1$, $2^2 = 4$, $3^2 = 4$, and $4^2 = 1$. So, for $x = 0$, we have two points on the curve: $(0, 1)$ and $(0, 4)$.\n\n2. For $x = 1$, we have $x^3 + 1 = 1^3 + 1 = 2$. The possible values of $y^2$ are the same as before, but none of them are equal to 2. So, for $x = 1$, there are no points on the curve.\n\n3. For $x = 2$, we have $x^3 + 1 = 2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. The possible values of $y^2$ are the same as before, but none of them are equal to 4. So, for $x = 2$, there are no points on the curve.\n\n4. For $x = 3$, we have $x^3 + 1 = 3^3 + 1 = 27 + 1 = 28 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. The possible values of $y^2$ are the same as before, and we find that $2^2 = 4$ and $3^2 = 4$ are equal to 3. So, for $x = 3$, we have two points on the curve: $(3, 2)$ and $(3, 3)$.\n\n5. For $x = 4$, we have $x^3 + 1 = 4^3 + 1 = 64 + 1 = 65 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. The possible values of $y^2$ are the same as before, and we find that $0^2 = 0$ is equal to 0. So, for $x = 4$, we have one point on the curve: $(4, 0)$.\n\nIn total, we have found 6 points on the curve: $(0, 1)$, $(0, 4)$, $(3, 2)$, $(3, 3)$, and $(4, 0)$. Additionally, we must include the point at infinity, denoted as $\\mathcal{O}$, which is the identity element in the group of points of $E$. Therefore, the order of the group of points of $E$ over $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$ is 7."
