    "message_2": "To apply the Jacobi iterative method, we first rewrite the given system of linear equations in the form x = Dx + b, where D is a diagonal matrix, x is the vector of unknowns, and b is a constant vector. We can rewrite the given system as follows:\n\n```\nx = (1/3)(y + z + 10)\ny = (1/5)(-2x + z + 3)\nz = (1/4)(x - y + 7)\n```\n\nNow, we can perform three iterations using the initial guesses x(0) = y(0) = z(0) = 0.\n\nIteration 1:\nx(1) = (1/3)(0 + 0 + 10) = 10/3 ≈ 3.33\ny(1) = (1/5)(-2(0) + 0 + 3) = 3/5 ≈ 0.60\nz(1) = (1/4)(0 - 0 + 7) = 7/4 ≈ 1.75\n\nIteration 2:\nx(2) = (1/3)(0.60 + 1.75 + 10) ≈ 4.12\ny(2) = (1/5)(-2(3.33) + 1.75 + 3) ≈ 0.37\nz(2) = (1/4)(3.33 - 0.60 + 7) ≈ 2.43\n\nIteration 3:\nx(3) = (1/3)(0.37 + 2.43 + 10) ≈ 4.27\ny(3) = (1/5)(-2(4.12) + 2.43 + 3) ≈ 0.45\nz(3) = (1/4)(4.12 - 0.37 + 7) ≈ 2.68\n\nAfter three iterations, the approximate solutions are:\nx ≈ 4.27\ny ≈ 0.45\nz ≈ 2.68"
