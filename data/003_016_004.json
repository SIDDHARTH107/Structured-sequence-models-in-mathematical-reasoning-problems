    "message_2": "The phase shift of a wave is the horizontal shift of the wave from its standard position. In the given function y = 3 sin(2x - π/6), the phase shift can be found by looking at the term inside the sine function.\n\nThe general form of a sine function is y = A sin(B(x - C)), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, the function is y = 3 sin(2x - π/6). Comparing it with the general form, we can see that B = 2 and the term inside the sine function is (2x - π/6).\n\nTo find the phase shift, we can set the term inside the sine function equal to zero:\n\n2x - π/6 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x = π/6\nx = π/12\n\nSo, the phase shift of the wave is π/12 to the right."
