    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Here's a simple implementation of PSO to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4 in the range [1, 10]:\n\n1. Initialize the swarm: Set the number of particles (e.g., 10), their initial positions, and velocities randomly within the search space [1, 10].\n\n2. Calculate the fitness of each particle: Evaluate the function f(x) for each particle's position.\n\n3. Update the personal best (pBest) and global best (gBest) positions: If a particle's current position has a better fitness than its previous pBest, update its pBest. If a particle's pBest is better than the current gBest, update the gBest.\n\n4. Update the velocities and positions of the particles: For each particle, update its velocity based on its current velocity, pBest, and gBest, and then update its position using the new velocity.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a certain number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a minimum error threshold or maximum number of iterations).\n\nAfter running the PSO algorithm, the gBest position will represent the approximate minimum value of the function f(x) in the given range. Note that PSO is a heuristic optimization method, and the solution may not be the exact minimum value but a close approximation."
