    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4 at the point (1, 1, sqrt(2)), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet the surface be given by the function F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 4 = 0. Then the gradient of F is:\n\n∇F = (2x, 2y, 2z)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, sqrt(2)), the gradient is:\n\n∇F(1, 1, sqrt(2)) = (2, 2, 2sqrt(2))\n\nNow, let's find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = (∇F_x) · (∇F_x) = (2)^2 = 4\nF = (∇F_x) · (∇F_y) = (2)(2) = 4\nG = (∇F_y) · (∇F_y) = (2)^2 = 4\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form coefficients. We need to find the second derivatives of F:\n\nF_xx = 2\nF_yy = 2\nF_zz = 2\nF_xy = 0\nF_xz = 0\nF_yz = 0\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = (∇^2F_x) · N = (2, 0, 0) · (2, 2, 2sqrt(2)) = 4\nM = (∇^2F_y) · N = (0, 2, 0) · (2, 2, 2sqrt(2)) = 4\nN = (∇^2F_z) · N = (0, 0, 2) · (2, 2, 2sqrt(2)) = 4sqrt(2)\n\nNow, we can find the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nK = (4 * 4sqrt(2) - 4^2) / (4 * 4 - 4^2)\nK = (16sqrt(2) - 16) / (16 - 16)\nK = (16sqrt(2) - 16) / 0\n\nSince the denominator is 0, the Gaussian curvature is undefined at the point (1, 1, sqrt(2))."
