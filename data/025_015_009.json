    "message_2": "To find the set of all points on the surface with z=1, we simply substitute z=1 into the given equation:\n\nx² + y² + (1)² + 3xy + 5x(1) - 6y(1) = 0\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\nx² + y² + 1 + 3xy + 5x - 6y = 0\n\nRearrange the terms:\n\nx² + y² + 3xy + 5x - 6y = -1\n\nNow, this equation represents the set of all points (x, y, 1) on the surface with z=1."
