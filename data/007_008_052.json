    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p - a is divisible by p. In other words, a^(p-1) - 1 is divisible by p.\n\nIn this case, p = 7 (which is a prime number) and a = 3. So, we want to find the remainder when 3^10 is divided by 7.\n\nAccording to Fermat's Little Theorem, 3^(7-1) - 1 is divisible by 7. That is, 3^6 - 1 is divisible by 7.\n\nNow, we can rewrite 3^10 as (3^6) * (3^4). Since 3^6 - 1 is divisible by 7, we know that 3^6 is congruent to 1 modulo 7. Therefore, (3^6) * (3^4) is congruent to 1 * (3^4) modulo 7.\n\nSo, we just need to find the remainder when 3^4 is divided by 7. \n\n3^4 = 81, and 81 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 11 and a remainder of 4.\n\nThus, the remainder when 3^10 is divided by 7 is 4."
