    "message_2": "The center of a group G, denoted as Z(G), is the set of all elements that commute with every element in the group. In other words, Z(G) = {g ∈ G | gx = xg for all x ∈ G}.\n\nFor a non-abelian group of order 8, the center cannot be the entire group since the group is not commutative. Also, the center cannot be the trivial group (i.e., containing only the identity element) because the center of a group is always a normal subgroup, and a group of order 8 with a trivial center would imply that the group is simple, which is not possible for a group of order 8.\n\nSo, the only remaining possibility is that the center has order 2 (since the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group). Thus, the number of elements in the center of a non-abelian group of order 8 is 2.\n\nNow, let's see how this information helps in determining the isomorphism type of the group. There are only two non-abelian groups of order 8: the dihedral group D_4 (also known as D_8 in some notations) and the quaternion group Q_8.\n\nThe dihedral group D_4 has a center of order 2, consisting of the identity element and the central reflection. The quaternion group Q_8 also has a center of order 2, consisting of the identity element and the element -1.\n\nSince both non-abelian groups of order 8 have a center with 2 elements, knowing the number of elements in the center alone does not uniquely determine the isomorphism type of the group. However, it does narrow down the possibilities to just these two groups. To determine the isomorphism type, one would need to examine additional properties of the group, such as the structure of its subgroups or the nature of its elements (e.g., the presence of elements of order 4 in Q_8 but not in D_4)."
