    "message_2": "A non-trivial knot is a knot that cannot be untangled into a simple loop (also known as an unknot). The simplest non-trivial knot is the trefoil knot, which has three crossings. However, the trefoil knot has only four edges.\n\nTo construct a non-trivial knot with six edges, we can start with a trefoil knot and add two additional edges. One way to do this is to add a \"twist\" to one of the edges of the trefoil knot, creating two new crossings. This results in a knot with six edges and a total of five crossings.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of crossings required to construct a non-trivial knot with six edges is 5."
