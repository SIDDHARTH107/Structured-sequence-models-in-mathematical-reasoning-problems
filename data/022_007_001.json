    "message_1": "Let f(z) be an entire function such that |f(z)| ≤ 4|z| for all z in the complex plane. Prove that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 1.\n\nUsing Liouville's Theorem from Complex Analysis, if the function f(z) is entire and bounded, it must be a constant function. However, in this case, |f(z)| ≤ 4|z|, which suggests that f(z) is not constant.\n\nSo, we need to use the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to prove that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 1. Specifically, the theorem states that any non-constant polynomial over the complex numbers must have at least one complex root.\n\nTherefore, the question for a math student to solve is: Prove that any entire function f(z) satisfying |f(z)| ≤ 4|z| is a polynomial of degree at most 1.",
    "message_2": "To prove that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 1, we will use the Cauchy's inequality for the derivatives of f(z).\n\nLet's consider a circle with radius R centered at the origin. For any z in the circle, we have |z| < R. Now, we can apply Cauchy's inequality for the first derivative of f(z) on this circle:\n\n|f'(z)| ≤ (max |f(z)| on the circle) / R\n\nSince |f(z)| ≤ 4|z|, we have:\n\n|max |f(z)| on the circle| ≤ 4R\n\nSo, |f'(z)| ≤ 4R / R = 4\n\nNow, let's consider the second derivative of f(z). Applying Cauchy's inequality again, we have:\n\n|f''(z)| ≤ (max |f'(z)| on the circle) / R\n\nSince |f'(z)| ≤ 4, we have:\n\n|max |f'(z)| on the circle| ≤ 4\n\nSo, |f''(z)| ≤ 4 / R\n\nAs R approaches infinity, |f''(z)| approaches 0. This means that f''(z) is identically zero. Therefore, f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 1.\n\nIn conclusion, any entire function f(z) satisfying |f(z)| ≤ 4|z| is a polynomial of degree at most 1."
