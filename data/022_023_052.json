    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation with the given initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution has the form:\n\n$u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nSubstitute this into the wave equation:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = c^2X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $c^2X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ only and the right side is a function of $x$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $T''(t) + c^2\\lambda^2T(t) = 0$\n\n2) $X''(x) + \\lambda^2X(x) = 0$\n\nSolve the second equation for $X(x)$:\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda^2X(x) = 0$\n\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator equation, and its solutions are sines and cosines:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\lambda x) + B\\cos(\\lambda x)$\n\nNow, apply the initial condition $u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$:\n\n$X(x)T(0) = A\\sin(\\lambda x) + B\\cos(\\lambda x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$\n\nSince $T(0) \\neq 0$, we can divide by it:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\lambda x) + B\\cos(\\lambda x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$\n\nThis implies that $B = 0$ and $\\lambda = \\pi$, so $X(x) = A\\sin(\\pi x)$.\n\nNow, solve the first equation for $T(t)$:\n\n$T''(t) + c^2\\pi^2T(t) = 0$\n\nThis is also a simple harmonic oscillator equation, and its solutions are sines and cosines:\n\n$T(t) = C\\sin(c\\pi t) + D\\cos(c\\pi t)$\n\nApply the initial condition $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = 0$:\n\n$X(x)T'(0) = A\\sin(\\pi x)(c\\pi C) = 0$\n\nSince $X(x) = A\\sin(\\pi x)$ is nonzero, we must have $T'(0) = 0$. This implies that $C = 0$, so $T(t) = D\\cos(c\\pi t)$.\n\nFinally, the solution is given by:\n\n$u(x, t) = X(x)T(t) = AD\\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(c\\pi t)$\n\nSince the initial conditions are satisfied for any values of $A$ and $D$, we can choose $A = D = 1$ without loss of generality:\n\n$u(x, t) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(c\\pi t)$"
