    "message_2": "The function $f(x) = x^2$ is an even function, so its Fourier series will only have cosine terms. The Fourier series of an even function is given by:\n\n$$S_n(x) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k \\cos(kx),$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$a_0 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) dx$$\n\nand\n\n$$a_k = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\cos(kx) dx.$$\n\nFirst, let's find $a_0$:\n\n$$a_0 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} x^2 dx = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^3}{3} - \\frac{(-\\pi)^3}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3}.$$\n\nNow, let's find $a_k$:\n\n$$a_k = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} x^2 \\cos(kx) dx.$$\n\nSince $x^2$ is an even function and $\\cos(kx)$ is also an even function, their product is also even. Thus, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n$$a_k = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} x^2 \\cos(kx) dx.$$\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to evaluate the integral. Let $u = x^2$ and $dv = \\cos(kx) dx$. Then, $du = 2x dx$ and $v = \\frac{1}{k} \\sin(kx)$. Applying integration by parts:\n\n$$a_k = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left[\\frac{x^2}{k} \\sin(kx)\\right]_0^{\\pi} - \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{2x}{k} \\sin(kx) dx.$$\n\nThe first term evaluates to zero since $\\sin(k\\pi) = 0$ for all integer values of $k$. Now, let's evaluate the remaining integral. Let $u = x$ and $dv = \\sin(kx) dx$. Then, $du = dx$ and $v = -\\frac{1}{k} \\cos(kx)$. Applying integration by parts again:\n\n$$a_k = -\\frac{4}{k\\pi} \\left[-\\frac{x}{k} \\cos(kx)\\right]_0^{\\pi} + \\frac{4}{k^2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\cos(kx) dx.$$\n\nThe first term evaluates to zero since $\\cos(k\\pi) = 1$ or $-1$ for all integer values of $k$. The remaining integral evaluates to zero as well, since the integral of $\\cos(kx)$ over a full period is zero.\n\nThus, we have $a_k = 0$ for all $k \\geq 1$. Therefore, the Fourier series of $f(x) = x^2$ is given by:\n\n$$S_n(x) = \\frac{a_0}{2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3}.$$\n\nSince the Fourier series does not depend on $n$, it converges pointwise to $f(x)$ for all $x \\in (-\\pi, \\pi]$ for any value of $n$. However, note that the Fourier series converges to the function value at the endpoints of the interval, but not at the interior points, since the Fourier series is a constant function while $f(x) = x^2$ is not."
