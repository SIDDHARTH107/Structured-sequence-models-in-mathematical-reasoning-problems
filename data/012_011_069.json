    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex that, if removed along with its incident edges, would increase the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, if removed, would increase the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nTo find the cut vertices and bridges, we can use the following algorithm:\n\n1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph, and for each vertex, keep track of its discovery time and the lowest discovery time of its adjacent vertices.\n2. A vertex is a cut vertex if it is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children, or if it is not the root and has a child with no back edges to an ancestor.\n3. An edge is a bridge if the lowest discovery time of one of its vertices is greater than the discovery time of the other vertex.\n\nApplying this algorithm to the given graph, we get the following results:\n\nCut vertices: 3, 4, 5\nBridges: (3, 5)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Vertex 3 is a cut vertex because if it is removed, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2} and {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.\n2. Vertex 4 is a cut vertex because if it is removed, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2, 3} and {5, 6, 7, 8}.\n3. Vertex 5 is a cut vertex because if it is removed, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {6, 7, 8}.\n4. The edge (3, 5) is a bridge because if it is removed, the graph will be split into two connected components: {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}."
