    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line of the curve $C$ at the point $[1:1:1:1]$, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation of the curve with respect to each of the homogeneous coordinates $s, t, u,$ and $v$. Then, we will evaluate these partial derivatives at the given point.\n\nThe partial derivatives are:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial s} = 3s^2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 2t, \\quad \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial u} = -2uv, \\quad \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial v} = -u^2.\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point $[1:1:1:1]$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial s}(1,1,1,1) = 3, \\quad \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}(1,1,1,1) = 2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial u}(1,1,1,1) = -2, \\quad \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial v}(1,1,1,1) = -1.\n$$\n\nThe tangent line of the curve $C$ at the point $[1:1:1:1]$ can be represented by the following equation:\n\n$$\nL: \\alpha(s-1) = \\beta(t-1) = \\gamma(u-1) = \\delta(v-1),\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma,$ and $\\delta$ are constants.\n\nNow, we can use the partial derivatives evaluated at the point $[1:1:1:1]$ to find the proportionality between the constants:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{3} = \\frac{\\beta}{2} = \\frac{\\gamma}{-2} = \\frac{\\delta}{-1}.\n$$\n\nWe can choose $\\alpha = 3$, $\\beta = 2$, $\\gamma = -2$, and $\\delta = -1$ as one possible set of constants that satisfy the proportionality. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line of the curve $C$ at the point $[1:1:1:1]$ is:\n\n$$\nL: 3(s-1) = 2(t-1) = -2(u-1) = -(v-1).\n$$"
