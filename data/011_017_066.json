    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using combinatorics. We have a 5x5 grid, and we want to arrange the numbers 1 to 5 in such a way that no number is repeated in any row or column. This is essentially a permutation problem.\n\nWe can think of this as placing the numbers 1 to 5 in the first row, then placing the remaining numbers in the second row, and so on. For the first row, we have 5 choices for the first number, 4 choices for the second number, 3 choices for the third number, 2 choices for the fourth number, and 1 choice for the last number. This gives us a total of 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange the numbers in the first row.\n\nNow, let's consider the second row. Since no number can be repeated in any column, we have 4 choices for the first number in the second row (it cannot be the same as the first number in the first row), 3 choices for the second number, 2 choices for the third number, and 1 choice for the fourth number. The last number in the second row is determined by the previous choices, so there is only 1 choice for it. This gives us a total of 4! ways to arrange the numbers in the second row.\n\nFor the third row, we have 3 choices for the first number, 2 choices for the second number, and 1 choice for the third number. The last two numbers in the third row are determined by the previous choices, so there are 1 choice for each of them. This gives us a total of 3! ways to arrange the numbers in the third row.\n\nFor the fourth row, we have 2 choices for the first number and 1 choice for the second number. The last three numbers in the fourth row are determined by the previous choices, so there are 1 choice for each of them. This gives us a total of 2! ways to arrange the numbers in the fourth row.\n\nFinally, for the fifth row, there is only 1 possible arrangement of the numbers, since they are determined by the previous choices in the other rows. This gives us a total of 1! ways to arrange the numbers in the fifth row.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to fill in the grid, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the numbers in each row:\n\n5! × 4! × 3! × 2! × 1! = 120 × 24 × 6 × 2 × 1 = 34,560\n\nSo there are 34,560 different ways to fill in the 5x5 grid with the numbers 1 to 5 such that no number is repeated in any row or column."
