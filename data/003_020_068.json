    "message_1": "A building is 50 meters tall. A person standing on top of the building is looking at a flagpole on the ground. The angle of depression to the bottom of the flagpole is 30 degrees. Using trigonometry, find the distance between the building and the base of the flagpole.",
    "message_2": "To find the distance between the building and the base of the flagpole, we can use trigonometry. Since the angle of depression is 30 degrees, the angle of elevation from the base of the flagpole to the top of the building is also 30 degrees. We can use the tangent function to solve this problem.\n\nLet's denote the distance between the building and the base of the flagpole as x. We can set up the following equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(30°) = (height of the building) / x\ntan(30°) = 50 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 50 / tan(30°)\nx ≈ 50 / 0.57735\nx ≈ 86.6025\n\nSo, the distance between the building and the base of the flagpole is approximately 86.6 meters."
