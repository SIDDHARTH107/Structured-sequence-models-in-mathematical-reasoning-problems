    "message_1": "Suppose two individuals are considering whether or not to start a business together. They each have a choice between investing in the business or not investing. If neither invests, they both receive $0. If both invest, they will each earn a profit of $100. However, if only one person invests and the other does not, the person who invests will earn $50, while the other person will earn nothing. Assuming that each person is risk-neutral and makes their decision based solely on profitability, what is the Nash equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the best response for each player given the other player's strategy. Let's denote the two individuals as Player 1 and Player 2. We can represent their choices in a payoff matrix:\n\n```\n               Player 2\n               Invest    Not Invest\nPlayer 1\nInvest        (100,100)  (50, 0)\nNot Invest    (0, 50)    (0, 0)\n```\n\nThe numbers in each cell represent the payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2, respectively.\n\nNow, let's find the best response for each player:\n\n1. If Player 1 believes that Player 2 will invest, their best response is to invest as well, since 100 > 0.\n2. If Player 1 believes that Player 2 will not invest, their best response is to invest, since 50 > 0.\n3. If Player 2 believes that Player 1 will invest, their best response is to invest as well, since 100 > 0.\n4. If Player 2 believes that Player 1 will not invest, their best response is to invest, since 50 > 0.\n\nIn this case, the best response for both players, regardless of the other player's strategy, is to invest. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium of this game is when both players invest, resulting in a payoff of (100, 100)."
