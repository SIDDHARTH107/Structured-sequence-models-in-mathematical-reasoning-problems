    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the third equation by 4 and then subtract the second equation from the resulting equation.\n\n4(x + 2y - 3z) = 4(-6)\n4x + 8y - 12z = -24\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the new equation:\n\n(4x + 8y - 12z) - (4x - y + 2z) = -24 - 4\n4x - 4x + 8y - (-y) - 12z + 2z = -20\n9y - 10z = -20 (1)\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the third equation by -2 and then add the first equation to the resulting equation.\n\n-2(x + 2y - 3z) = -2(-6)\n-2x - 4y + 6z = 12\n\nNow, add the first equation to the new equation:\n\n(2x + 3y - z) + (-2x - 4y + 6z) = 7 + 12\n2x - 2x + 3y - 4y - z + 6z = 19\n-y + 5z = 19 (2)\n\nNow, we will solve equation (1) for y:\n\n9y - 10z = -20\ny = (10z - 20)/9 (3)\n\nSubstitute equation (3) into equation (2):\n\n-((10z - 20)/9) + 5z = 19\n\nMultiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n-(10z - 20) + 45z = 171\n-10z + 20 + 45z = 171\n35z = 151\nz = 151/35\nz = 4.314 (approximately)\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into equation (3) to find the value of y:\n\ny = (10(4.314) - 20)/9\ny = (43.14 - 20)/9\ny = 23.14/9\ny = 2.571 (approximately)\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation to find the value of x:\n\n2x + 3(2.571) - 4.314 = 7\n2x + 7.713 - 4.314 = 7\n2x = 3.601\nx = 1.8005 (approximately)\n\nSo, the approximate values of x, y, and z are:\n\nx ≈ 1.8005\ny ≈ 2.571\nz ≈ 4.314"
