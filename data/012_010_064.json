    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible set of vertices that still covers all edges.\n\nIn this graph, we can find a minimum vertex cover by selecting vertices 2, 5, and 7. This set of vertices covers all edges, and no smaller set of vertices can cover all edges. Therefore, the minimum size of the vertex cover for this graph is 3."
