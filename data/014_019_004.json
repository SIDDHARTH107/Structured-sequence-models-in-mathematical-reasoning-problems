    "message_2": "A transposition cipher using a 3x4 grid means that the message \"HELLO WORLD\" (11 characters) has been rearranged into a grid with 3 rows and 4 columns, which can hold 12 characters. Since there is one extra space in the grid, we can represent it with an \"X\" (or any other placeholder).\n\nThe encrypted message would look like this:\n\nH E L L\nO W O R\nL D X\n\nNow, we need to find the number of possible arrangements of the letters in the grid. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of the 12 characters (11 letters + 1 placeholder).\n\nHowever, since there are repeated letters in the message (2 L's, 3 O's), we need to account for these repetitions in our calculation.\n\nThe number of permutations of 12 items with repetitions can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPermutations = 12! / (2! * 3!)\n\nWhere 12! is the factorial of 12 (the total number of positions in the grid), 2! is the factorial of the number of L's, and 3! is the factorial of the number of O's.\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n\n12! = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 479001600\n2! = 2 × 1 = 2\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n\nNow, we can find the number of permutations:\n\nPermutations = 479001600 / (2 * 6) = 479001600 / 12 = 39916800\n\nSo, there are 39,916,800 possible arrangements of letters in the 3x4 grid transposition cipher for the message \"HELLO WORLD\"."
