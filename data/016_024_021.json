    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal that is formed by recursively removing squares from an initial larger square. In each stage, the remaining squares from the previous stage are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the middle square is removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining 8 smaller squares.\n\nThe total number of squares in the nth stage can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal squares = (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nwhere n is the stage number.\n\nFor the 7th stage, we have:\n\nTotal squares = (8^7 - 1) / 7\nTotal squares = (2097152 - 1) / 7\nTotal squares = 2097151 / 7\nTotal squares = 299593\n\nSo, there are 299,593 squares in the 7th stage of the self-similar Sierpinski carpet fractal."
