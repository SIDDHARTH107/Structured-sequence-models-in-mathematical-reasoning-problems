    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the complex function $f(z)=\\frac{z^2-1}{(z-1)(z^2+4)}$, we need to find the values of $z$ for which the denominator is equal to zero. \n\nThe denominator is $(z-1)(z^2+4)$. Let's find the zeros of each factor:\n\n1. For the first factor, $z-1=0$, we have $z=1$.\n2. For the second factor, $z^2+4=0$, we have $z^2=-4$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $z=\\pm 2i$.\n\nSo, the singularities of the function are $z=1, 2i, -2i$."
