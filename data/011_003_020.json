    "message_2": "In Pascal's triangle, each number is the combination of the row number (n) and the position of the number in that row (k), which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nn! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nFor the 7th number in the 10th row, n = 10 and k = 6 (since the first number in the row is considered as the 0th position). So, we have:\n\n10! / (6! * (10-6)!) = 120\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the 9th number in the 15th row. In this case, n = 15 and k = 8. Using the same formula:\n\n15! / (8! * (15-8)!) = 6435\n\nSo, the value of the 9th number in the 15th row of Pascal's triangle is 6435."
