    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, Player A is given $10 and must decide how much to send to Player B. Whatever amount Player A sends, it will be tripled, and Player B will then decide how much of the tripled amount to send back to Player A. \n\nIf Player A sends $4 to Player B, how much should Player B send back to Player A to ensure they each end up with an equal amount of money?",
    "message_2": "If Player A sends $4 to Player B, the amount will be tripled, so Player B will receive 4 * 3 = $12. \n\nPlayer A will have $10 - $4 = $6 left after sending the money. To ensure both players end up with an equal amount of money, Player B should send back enough money to make Player A's total equal to half of the combined total of both players.\n\nThe combined total of both players is $6 (Player A's remaining money) + $12 (Player B's received money) = $18. Half of the combined total is $18 / 2 = $9.\n\nSo, Player B should send back $9 - $6 = $3 to Player A. This way, both players will have $9 each."
