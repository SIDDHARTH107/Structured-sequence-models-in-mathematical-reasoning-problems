    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3.\n2. The number of abelian groups of order 96 is equal to the number of partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization. In this case, the partitions of 5 and 1 are (5) and (1), so there are 2 abelian groups of order 96.\n3. The total number of groups of order 96 can be found using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of the divisors of the order. In this case, the divisors of 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96. The product of these divisors is 186,624.\n\nNow, we can find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96 by subtracting the number of abelian groups from the total number of groups:\n\n186,624 (total groups) - 2 (abelian groups) = 186,622\n\nSo, there are 186,622 non-abelian groups of order 96."
