    "message_2": "The chromatic polynomial of a graph is a polynomial that counts the number of proper colorings of the graph using k colors. A proper coloring is an assignment of colors to the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nThe given graph is a simple path with 5 vertices and 4 edges. We can find the chromatic polynomial by considering the number of ways to color the graph using k colors.\n\n1. Choose a color for vertex 1: There are k choices.\n2. Choose a color for vertex 2: Since it cannot have the same color as vertex 1, there are (k-1) choices.\n3. Choose a color for vertex 3: Since it cannot have the same color as vertex 2, there are (k-1) choices.\n4. Choose a color for vertex 4: Since it cannot have the same color as vertex 3, there are (k-1) choices.\n5. Choose a color for vertex 5: Since it cannot have the same color as vertex 4, there are (k-1) choices.\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial P(k) is given by:\n\nP(k) = k * (k-1) * (k-1) * (k-1) * (k-1)\n\nP(k) = k * (k-1)^4"
