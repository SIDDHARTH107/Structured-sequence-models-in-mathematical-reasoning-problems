    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations, which is known for exhibiting chaotic behavior for certain parameter values. The system is defined as follows:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nHere, a, b, and c are the parameters that determine the behavior of the system. Chaotic behavior is observed for certain combinations of these parameters.\n\nOne well-known set of parameter values that leads to chaotic behavior in the Rössler system is:\n\na = 0.2\nb = 0.2\nc = 5.7\n\nHowever, it is important to note that there are other combinations of parameter values that can also lead to chaotic behavior in the Rössler system. The specific values depend on the initial conditions and the range of parameter values being considered."
