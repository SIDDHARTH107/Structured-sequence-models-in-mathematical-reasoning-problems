    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a bipartite graph is a set of edges that connects each vertex in one partition to exactly one vertex in the other partition. In this case, since there are 6 vertices on one side and 7 vertices on the other side, a perfect matching is not possible because there will always be one unmatched vertex on the side with 7 vertices.\n\nTherefore, the number of perfect matchings that can be formed in this bipartite graph is 0."
