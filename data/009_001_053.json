    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of rabbits at time t (in years). Since the population is growing at a rate proportional to its current size, we can model this with the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = k dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫k dt\n\nln(P) = kt + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 100:\n\nln(100) = k(0) + C\n\nC = ln(100)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nln(P) = kt + ln(100)\n\nTo find the value of k, we can use the information that the population grows to 250 after 5 years:\n\nln(250) = k(5) + ln(100)\n\nSolving for k:\n\nk = (ln(250) - ln(100))/5\n\nk ≈ 0.18232\n\nNow that we have the value of k, we can find the population after 10 years:\n\nln(P(10)) = 0.18232(10) + ln(100)\n\nln(P(10)) ≈ 1.8232 + ln(100)\n\nP(10) = e^(1.8232 + ln(100))\n\nP(10) ≈ 625\n\nSo, the population of rabbits after 10 years will be approximately 625."
