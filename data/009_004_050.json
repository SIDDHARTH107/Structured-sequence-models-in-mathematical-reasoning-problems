    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion, we can use Hooke's Law and Newton's second law. Hooke's Law states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to the displacement from its equilibrium position:\n\nF = -kx\n\nwhere F is the force exerted by the spring, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nNewton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:\n\nF = ma\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object and a is its acceleration.\n\nCombining these two equations, we get:\n\nma = -kx\n\nThe acceleration is the second derivative of the displacement with respect to time:\n\na = d^2x/dt^2\n\nSo, the equation of motion becomes:\n\nm(d^2x/dt^2) = -kx\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the mass (m = 2 kg) and the spring constant (k = 50 N/m):\n\n2(d^2x/dt^2) = -50x\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation, which has the general solution:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(ωt) + B*sin(ωt)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, ω is the angular frequency, and t is the time. To find the angular frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nPlugging in the values for k and m, we get:\n\nω = sqrt(50/2) = 5 rad/s\n\nSince the mass is initially given a displacement of 10 cm (0.1 m) from its equilibrium position and is released with zero initial velocity, we have:\n\nx(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = A = 0.1 m\nv(0) = -A*ω*sin(0) + B*ω*cos(0) = B*ω = 0\n\nSolving for A and B, we get:\n\nA = 0.1 m\nB = 0\n\nSo, the equation of motion is:\n\nx(t) = 0.1*cos(5t)\n\nTo find the time period of the resulting vibration, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nPlugging in the value for ω, we get:\n\nT = 2π/5 ≈ 1.2566 s\n\nThus, the equation of motion is x(t) = 0.1*cos(5t), and the time period of the resulting vibration is approximately 1.2566 seconds."
