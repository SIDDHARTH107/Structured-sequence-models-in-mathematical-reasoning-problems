    "message_1": "A manufacturer makes shirts that are available in three sizes: small, medium, and large. The manufacturer has the following rules for producing these shirts:\n\n- For each small shirt produced, the manufacturer needs to produce one medium shirt to go with it.\n- For each medium shirt produced, the manufacturer needs to produce one large shirt to go with it.\n- For each large shirt produced, the manufacturer needs to produce two small shirts to go with it.\n\nIf the manufacturer produces 100 small shirts, how many total shirts (including small, medium, and large) will they end up producing?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The manufacturer produces 100 small shirts.\n2. For each small shirt, they need to produce one medium shirt. So they produce 100 medium shirts.\n3. For each medium shirt, they need to produce one large shirt. So they produce 100 large shirts.\n4. For each large shirt, they need to produce two small shirts. Since they produced 100 large shirts, they need to produce an additional 200 small shirts.\n5. Now, they have produced a total of 300 small shirts (100 initial + 200 additional). For each of these 200 additional small shirts, they need to produce one medium shirt. So they produce 200 more medium shirts.\n6. For each of these 200 additional medium shirts, they need to produce one large shirt. So they produce 200 more large shirts.\n\nNow let's add up the total number of shirts produced:\n\n- Small shirts: 100 initial + 200 additional = 300\n- Medium shirts: 100 initial + 200 additional = 300\n- Large shirts: 100 initial + 200 additional = 300\n\nTotal shirts produced = 300 small + 300 medium + 300 large = 900 shirts."
