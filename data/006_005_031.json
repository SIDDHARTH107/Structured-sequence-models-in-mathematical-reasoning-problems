    "message_1": "A machine in a factory produces defective items at a rate of 5% per hour. What is the probability that the next defective item will be produced within the next 30 minutes?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the defective item rate per 30 minutes (half an hour). Since the defective rate is 5% per hour, we can assume that the rate is constant throughout the hour. Therefore, the defective rate per 30 minutes is half of the hourly rate:\n\nDefective rate per 30 minutes = 0.5 * 5% = 2.5%\n\nNow, we can use the complement probability to find the probability that the next defective item will be produced within the next 30 minutes. The complement probability is the probability that the next defective item will NOT be produced within the next 30 minutes.\n\nComplement probability = 1 - probability of defective item within 30 minutes\n\nSince the defective rate per 30 minutes is 2.5%, the probability of not producing a defective item within the next 30 minutes is:\n\nComplement probability = 1 - 2.5% = 1 - 0.025 = 0.975\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the next defective item will be produced within the next 30 minutes by subtracting the complement probability from 1:\n\nProbability of defective item within 30 minutes = 1 - complement probability = 1 - 0.975 = 0.025\n\nSo, the probability that the next defective item will be produced within the next 30 minutes is 0.025 or 2.5%."
