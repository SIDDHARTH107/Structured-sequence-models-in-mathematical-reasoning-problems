    "message_1": "Consider a planar region $D$ that consists of the unit disk centered at the origin with a diameter removed. Let $p$ be a point in $D$ and let $B$ be the subset of $D$ consisting of all points that can be connected to $p$ by a path in $D$ that does not intersect the diameter that was removed.\n\nFind the fundamental group of $B$.",
    "message_2": "Let's first describe the space $D$ more precisely. The unit disk centered at the origin can be represented as the set of points $(x, y)$ such that $x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1$. The diameter that we remove is the segment connecting $(-1, 0)$ and $(1, 0)$. Therefore, $D = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\} \\setminus \\{(-1, 0), (1, 0)\\}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the point $p$ in $D$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $p$ lies in the upper half of the unit disk, i.e., $p = (x_p, y_p)$ with $y_p > 0$. The subset $B$ consists of all points in $D$ that can be connected to $p$ by a path in $D$ that does not intersect the removed diameter.\n\nTo find the fundamental group of $B$, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. We will cover $B$ with two open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $U \\cap V$ is also open and simply connected. Let $U$ be the upper half of the unit disk without the removed diameter, and let $V$ be the entire unit disk without the removed diameter. Then, $U \\cap V = B$.\n\nBoth $U$ and $V$ are simply connected, as they are homeomorphic to a disk with a hole in it. Therefore, their fundamental groups are trivial: $\\pi_1(U) = \\pi_1(V) = 0$. The Seifert-van Kampen theorem states that the fundamental group of $B$ is the free product of the fundamental groups of $U$ and $V$ with respect to the fundamental group of $U \\cap V$. Since all these groups are trivial, the fundamental group of $B$ is also trivial:\n\n$$\\pi_1(B) = \\pi_1(U) *_{\\pi_1(U \\cap V)} \\pi_1(V) = 0.$$\n\nThus, the fundamental group of $B$ is the trivial group."
