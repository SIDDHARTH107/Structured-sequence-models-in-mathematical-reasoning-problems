    "message_2": "In this problem, we can use the multiplication principle of counting. Since there are 3 different paths from point A to point B and 4 different paths from point B to point C, we can multiply the number of paths between these two pairs of points to find the total number of possible pathways from point A to point C through point B.\n\nTotal pathways from A to C through B = (paths from A to B) × (paths from B to C) = 3 × 4 = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 different possible pathways to reach from point A to point C through point B."
