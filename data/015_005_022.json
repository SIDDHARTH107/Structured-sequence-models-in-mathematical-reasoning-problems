    "message_2": "The maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Rössler system can be found numerically using various algorithms. It is not possible to provide an exact value without performing these calculations. However, for the given parameters a=0.2, b=0.2, and c=5.7, the maximum Lyapunov exponent is approximately 0.07. This value is rounded to two decimal places."
