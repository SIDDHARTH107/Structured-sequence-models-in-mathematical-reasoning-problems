    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node E, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. The algorithm works by finding augmenting paths in the residual graph and augmenting the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. Initialize the flow in all edges to 0.\n2. Find an augmenting path in the residual graph.\n3. Augment the flow along the path found in step 2.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nLet's apply the algorithm to the given network:\n\n1. Initial flow: 0 for all edges.\n\n2. Find an augmenting path:\n   A -> B -> D -> E with bottleneck capacity 5.\n\n3. Augment the flow:\n   A -> B: 5/5\n   A -> C: 0/4\n   B -> C: 0/2\n   B -> D: 5/5\n   C -> D: 0/3\n   C -> E: 0/6\n   D -> E: 5/4\n\n4.

The maximum flow from node A to node E is the sum of the flows leaving node A, which is 5 + 4 = 9."
