Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be a Lagrangian submanifold of the cotangent bundle $T^*S^1$ that is the boundary of a disc in $D^2 \\times S^1$ that winds once around the core of the torus. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be the moduli space of pseudo-holomorphic discs in $M$ with boundary on $\\mathcal{L}$ and asymptotic to Reeb orbits of the form $z \\mapsto e^{ikz}$ with $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Compute the dimension of $\\mathcal{M}$ for $k=1$ using Floer homology techniques.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}$ for $k=1$, we will use Floer homology techniques. We start by considering the linearized Cauchy-Riemann operator, which is a Fredholm operator. The index of this operator will give us the expected dimension of the moduli space.\n\nLet $J$ be an almost complex structure on $M$ compatible with the symplectic form, and let $u: \\mathbb{D} \\to M$ be a pseudo-holomorphic disc with boundary on $\\mathcal{L}$ and asymptotic to the Reeb orbit $z \\mapsto e^{iz}$. The linearized Cauchy-Riemann operator is given by\n\n$$D_u = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} + J(u(s,t))\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t},$$\n\nwhere $(s,t)$ are the coordinates on the disc $\\mathbb{D}$.\n\nThe Fredholm index of $D_u$ is given by the difference between the dimensions of its kernel and cokernel. Since $u$ is a pseudo-holomorphic disc, we have $D_u u = 0$, which implies that the dimension of the kernel is at least 1. Moreover, since $u$ is asymptotic to the Reeb orbit $z \\mapsto e^{iz}$, the kernel of $D_u$ is generated by the tangent vector to this orbit, which is given by\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} e^{iz} = ie^{iz}.$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the dimension of the cokernel of $D_u$. Since $u$ has boundary on the Lagrangian submanifold $\\mathcal{L}$, the cokernel of $D_u$ is isomorphic to the space of normal directions to $\\mathcal{L}$ along its boundary. In this case, the boundary of $\\mathcal{L}$ is a circle, and the normal directions are given by the tangent vectors to the Reeb orbits. Thus, the dimension of the cokernel is 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fredholm index of $D_u$ is given by\n\n$$\\text{Index}(D_u) = \\dim(\\ker(D_u)) - \\dim(\\operatorname{coker}(D_u)) = 1 - 1 = 0.$$\n\nThis implies that the expected dimension of the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}$ for $k=1$ is 0."
