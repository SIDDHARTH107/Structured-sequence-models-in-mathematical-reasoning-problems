    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation analytically, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, t) = X(x)T(t), where X(x) is a function of x only and T(t) is a function of t only.\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we divide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nT''(t) / T(t) = 4X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x only, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\nT''(t) / T(t) = 4X''(x) / X(x) = -λ\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) T''(t) + λT(t) = 0\n2) X''(x) + (λ/4)X(x) = 0\n\nWe will solve the second ODE first, considering the boundary conditions u(0, t) = u(π, t) = 0:\n\nX''(x) + (λ/4)X(x) = 0, with X(0) = X(π) = 0\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem, and the solutions are given by:\n\nX_n(x) = sin(nx), with λ_n = 4n^2, for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we solve the first ODE:\n\nT''(t) + λT(t) = 0, with λ = 4n^2\n\nThe general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT_n(t) = A_n cos(2nt) + B_n sin(2nt)\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions:\n\nu(x, 0) = sin^2(x) => X(x)T(0) = sin^2(x)\n\nSince T(0) = A_n, we have:\n\nX_n(x)A_n = sin^2(x)\n\nWe can expand sin^2(x) using the Fourier series:\n\nsin^2(x) = (1/2) - (1/2)cos(2x)\n\nComparing this with the eigenfunctions X_n(x), we have:\n\nA_0 = 1/2, A_1 = -1/2, and A_n = 0 for n > 1\n\nNow, we apply the second initial condition:\n\nu_t(x, 0) = 0 => X'(x)T'(0) = 0\n\nSince X'(x) is not zero, we must have T'(0) = 0. This implies that B_n = 0 for all n.\n\nNow, we can write the solution as a sum of the product of X_n(x) and T_n(t):\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [X_n(x)T_n(t)]\n\nu(x, t) = (1/2) - (1/2)cos(2x)cos(2t)\n\nThis is the analytic solution of the given wave equation with the specified initial and boundary conditions."
