    "message_1": "Amy is grading math papers and needs to assign a grade from 0 to 10 to each student. However, she finds it difficult to determine the exact grade for some students because the answers are not perfectly right or wrong. For example, some students answered almost all questions correctly, but made some small mistakes. Amy decides to use a fuzzy logic system to assign grades, where a grade of 0 is assigned to completely wrong answers, 10 is assigned to completely correct answers, and grades in between are assigned based on how close the answer is to being 100% correct. Using a membership function where a grade of 0 corresponds to 0% correct, 10 corresponds to 100% correct, and grades in between correspond to the percentage of the answer that is correct, determine the grade Amy should assign to a student who answered 80% of the questions correctly.",
    "message_2": "To determine the grade Amy should assign to a student who answered 80% of the questions correctly, we can use a simple linear function to map the percentage of correct answers to the grade scale of 0 to 10.\n\nGrade = (Percentage of correct answers / 100) * 10\n\nFor a student who answered 80% of the questions correctly:\n\nGrade = (80 / 100) * 10\nGrade = 0.8 * 10\nGrade = 8\n\nAmy should assign a grade of 8 to the student who answered 80% of the questions correctly."
