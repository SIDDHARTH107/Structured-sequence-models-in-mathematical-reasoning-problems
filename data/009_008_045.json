    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution u(x, t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T''(t) - 4X''(x)T(t) = 0\n\nNow, we divide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nT''(t)/T(t) = 4X''(x)/X(x)\n\nSince the left-hand side is a function of t only and the right-hand side is a function of x only, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant k:\n\nT''(t)/T(t) = 4X''(x)/X(x) = k\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) T''(t) = kT(t)\n2) X''(x) = (k/4)X(x)\n\nWe first solve the second equation:\n\nX''(x) = (k/4)X(x)\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem. The general solution is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(√(k/4)x) + B*sin(√(k/4)x)\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(πx):\n\nX(x)T(0) = sin(πx)\n\nSince T(0) ≠ 0, we have:\n\nX(x) = sin(πx)\n\nThis implies that B = 1, A = 0, and √(k/4) = π. Thus, k = 4π^2.\n\nNow, we solve the first equation:\n\nT''(t) = kT(t)\n\nT''(t) = 4π^2T(t)\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C*cos(2πt) + D*sin(2πt)\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition u_t(x, 0) = cos(πx):\n\nX(x)T'(0) = cos(πx)\n\nSince X(x) ≠ 0, we have:\n\nT'(0) = 1\n\nDifferentiating T(t) with respect to t:\n\nT'(t) = -2πC*sin(2πt) + 2πD*cos(2πt)\n\nNow, we apply the condition T'(0) = 1:\n\n2πD = 1\n\nThus, D = 1/(2π) and C = 0.\n\nNow, we have the solution:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t) = sin(πx) * sin(2πt)\n\nFinally, we find the solution at t = 0.25:\n\nu(x, 0.25) = sin(πx) * sin(2π(0.25)) = sin(πx) * sin(π/2) = sin(πx)"
