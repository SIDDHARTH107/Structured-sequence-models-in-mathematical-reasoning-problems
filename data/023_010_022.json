If the image is reconstructed using only the top 1% of the transformed pixel values, calculate the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed image, assuming that the maximum pixel value of the original image is 255.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the PSNR of the reconstructed image, we first need to find the mean squared error (MSE) between the original image and the reconstructed image. Since we are only using the top 1% of the transformed pixel values, we can assume that the remaining 99% of the pixel values are lost, contributing to the error.\n\nThe total number of pixels in the image is 512 x 512 = 262,144 pixels. The top 1% of the transformed pixel values corresponds to 0.01 x 262,144 = 2,621.44 pixels. Since we can't have a fraction of a pixel, we'll round it to 2,621 pixels.\n\nNow, let's assume that the error introduced by using only the top 1% of the transformed pixel values is uniformly distributed across the remaining 99% of the pixels. Therefore, the total error is spread across 262,144 - 2,621 = 259,523 pixels.\n\nThe range of pixel values in the transformed image is from -50 to 100, so the maximum possible error for a single pixel is 100 - (-50) = 150. Since the error is uniformly distributed, the average error per pixel is half of the maximum error, which is 150 / 2 = 75.\n\nNow, we can calculate the MSE as the average squared error per pixel:\n\nMSE = (75^2) * (259,523 / 262,144) = 5625 * 0.99 ≈ 5568.75\n\nFinally, we can calculate the PSNR using the formula:\n\nPSNR = 10 * log10((MAX^2) / MSE)\n\nwhere MAX is the maximum pixel value of the original image, which is 255.\n\nPSNR = 10 * log10((255^2) / 5568.75) ≈ 10 * log10(65025 / 5568.75) ≈ 10 * log10(11.67) ≈ 10 * 1.067 ≈ 10.67 dB\n\nSo, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed image is approximately 10.67 dB."
