    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 695019, we can start by testing the smallest prime number, 2, and then move up to other prime numbers until we find a factor.\n\n695019 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. Let's move on to the next smallest prime number, 3.\n\n695019 ÷ 3 ≈ 231673. Since the result is not a whole number, 695019 is not divisible by 3.\n\nNext, we try dividing by the next smallest prime number, 5.\n\n695019 ÷ 5 ≈ 139003.8. Again, the result is not a whole number, so 695019 is not divisible by 5.\n\nWe continue with the next smallest prime number, 7.\n\n695019 ÷ 7 ≈ 99359.857. The result is not a whole number, so 695019 is not divisible by 7.\n\nNow, we try dividing by the next smallest prime number, 11.\n\n695019 ÷ 11 ≈ 63183.545. The result is not a whole number, so 695019 is not divisible by 11.\n\nNext, we try dividing by the next smallest prime number, 13.\n\n695019 ÷ 13 ≈ 53463.769. The result is not a whole number, so 695019 is not divisible by 13.\n\nFinally, we try dividing by the next smallest prime number, 17.\n\n695019 ÷ 17 ≈ 40883. The result is a whole number, so 695019 is divisible by 17.\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime factor of 695019 is 17."
