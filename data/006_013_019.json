What is the probability that neither an earthquake nor a tornado will occur in this region in a given year?",
    "message_2": "Let P(E) be the probability of an earthquake occurring in a year, P(T) be the probability of a tornado occurring in a year, and P(E ∪ T) be the probability of either an earthquake or a tornado occurring in a year. We are given:\n\nP(E) = 0.03\nP(T) = 0.01\nP(E ∪ T) = 0.04\n\nWe want to find the probability of neither an earthquake nor a tornado occurring in a year, which is P(E' ∩ T'), where E' represents the complement of E (no earthquake) and T' represents the complement of T (no tornado).\n\nUsing the formula for the probability of the union of two events, we have:\n\nP(E ∪ T) = P(E) + P(T) - P(E ∩ T)\n\nWe are not given the probability of both an earthquake and a tornado occurring in a year, P(E ∩ T), but we can find it using the given probabilities:\n\n0.04 = 0.03 + 0.01 - P(E ∩ T)\nP(E ∩ T) = 0.03 + 0.01 - 0.04\nP(E ∩ T) = 0\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the probability of the intersection of the complements of two events:\n\nP(E' ∩ T') = 1 - P(E ∪ T)\n\nSubstituting the given value for P(E ∪ T):\n\nP(E' ∩ T') = 1 - 0.04\nP(E' ∩ T') = 0.96\n\nTherefore, the probability that neither an earthquake nor a tornado will occur in this region in a given year is 0.96 or 96%."
