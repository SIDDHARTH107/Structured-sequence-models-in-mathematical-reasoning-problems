    "message_1": "A carnival game involves rolling a standard six-sided die. If you roll a 5 or a 6, you win. What is the probability of winning this game?",
    "message_2": "There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a standard six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. To win the game, you need to roll a 5 or a 6. There are 2 winning outcomes (5 and 6) out of the 6 possible outcomes.\n\nThe probability of winning the game is the number of winning outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of winning outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nProbability = 2 / 6\n\nProbability = 1 / 3\n\nSo, the probability of winning this game is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333, which is 33.33% chance of winning."
