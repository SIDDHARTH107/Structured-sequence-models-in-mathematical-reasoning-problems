    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation, and multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation.\n\n(4x - y + 5z) - 2(2x + 3y - z) = -1 - 2(7)\n(6x + y + 3z) - 3(2x + 3y - z) = 13 - 3(7)\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n-7y + 7z = -15\n-8y + 6z = -8\n\nNow, let's eliminate y from these two new equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 8 and the second equation by 7, and then add the two equations:\n\n8(-7y + 7z) = 8(-15)\n7(-8y + 6z) = 7(-8)\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n-56y + 56z = -120\n-56y + 42z = -56\n\nAdding the two equations, we get:\n\n14z = -64\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = -64 / 14\nz = -32 / 7\n\nNow that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into one of the equations with y:\n\n-7y + 7(-32/7) = -15\n\nSolving for y:\n\n-7y - 32 = -15\n-7y = 17\ny = -17/7\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of y and z back into one of the equations with x:\n\n2x + 3(-17/7) - (-32/7) = 7\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x - 17 + 32/7 = 7\n2x = 24/7\nx = 12/7\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 12/7\ny = -17/7\nz = -32/7"
