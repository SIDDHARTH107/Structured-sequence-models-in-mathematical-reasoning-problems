    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of 100 cars passing through a road, at least 5 will be involved in a rear-end collision? Assume that the probability of a car being involved in a rear-end collision is 0.02.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, rear-end collisions) in n trials (the number of cars), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of a single success (0.02), and (1-p) is the probability of a single failure (0.98).\n\nHowever, we want to find the probability of at least 5 rear-end collisions, so we need to find the complement of the probability of having 0 to 4 collisions and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 2) - P(X = 3) - P(X = 4)\n\nNow, we can calculate each probability using the binomial formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * (0.02)^0 * (0.98)^100 ≈ 0.133\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * (0.02)^1 * (0.98)^99 ≈ 0.271\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * (0.02)^2 * (0.98)^98 ≈ 0.302\nP(X = 3) = C(100, 3) * (0.02)^3 * (0.98)^97 ≈ 0.201\nP(X = 4) = C(100, 4) * (0.02)^4 * (0.98)^96 ≈ 0.088\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 5 rear-end collisions:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - 0.133 - 0.271 - 0.302 - 0.201 - 0.088 ≈ 0.005\n\nSo, the probability of at least 5 rear-end collisions out of 100 cars is approximately 0.5%."
