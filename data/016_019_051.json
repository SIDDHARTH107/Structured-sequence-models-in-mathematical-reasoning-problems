    "message_2": "The Koch Island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is generated by iterating the following process: divide the line segment into three equal parts, and replace the middle segment with the other two sides of an equilateral triangle with the same side length as the removed segment.\n\nAfter each iteration, the length of the line segment increases by a factor of 4/3. So, after n iterations, the length of each side of the Koch Island is (4/3)^n times the original length.\n\nIn this case, after the fifth iteration, the length of each side of the Koch Island is (4/3)^5 times the original length of 1 unit.\n\n(4/3)^5 = 1024/243 ≈ 4.217\n\nSince the Koch Island is an equilateral triangle, the total length of the Koch Island after the fifth iteration is 3 times the length of one side:\n\n3 * 4.217 ≈ 12.651\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch Island after the fifth iteration is approximately 12.651 units."
