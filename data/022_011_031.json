    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 4 = 0\n(z - 2)(z + 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two zeros: z = 2 and z = -2. Since each zero has a multiplicity of 1 (i.e., they are not repeated), they are both simple zeros.\n\nNow, to find the poles of the function f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 2z + 1 = 0\n(z + 1)^2 = 0\n\nThis gives us one pole: z = -1. However, since the pole has a multiplicity of 2 (i.e., it is repeated), it is a double pole.\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) has two simple zeros at z = 2 and z = -2, and one double pole at z = -1."
