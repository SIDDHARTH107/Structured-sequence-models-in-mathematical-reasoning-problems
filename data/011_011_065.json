    "message_1": "A group of 10 people are planning to share a pizza with 4 different toppings. Each person can choose one or more toppings, but the toppings must be shared among all the people. In how many ways can the pizza toppings be partitioned among the group of 10 people?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of \"stars and bars\" in combinatorics. We have 4 different toppings and 10 people. We can think of the toppings as \"stars\" and the people as \"dividers\" or \"bars\" that separate the toppings.\n\nWe will use the formula for distributing n identical items (toppings) among r distinct groups (people):\n\nC(n + r - 1, r - 1)\n\nIn this case, n = 4 (toppings) and r = 10 (people). So, we have:\n\nC(4 + 10 - 1, 10 - 1) = C(13, 9)\n\nNow, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nC(13, 9) = 13! / (9!4!)\n\nC(13, 9) = (13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5) / (9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nC(13, 9) = 715\n\nSo, there are 715 ways to partition the pizza toppings among the group of 10 people."
