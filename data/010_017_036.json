    "message_2": "We will use the Morse inequalities to solve this problem. The Morse inequalities relate the number of critical points of a Morse function to the Betti numbers of the underlying manifold. In our case, the manifold is $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which has Betti numbers $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 0$, and $b_2 = 0$. The Morse inequalities state that:\n\n$n_i \\geq b_i$ for all $i = 0, 1, 2$.\n\nNow, since $f^{-1}(a)$ contains exactly $3$ critical points, we have:\n\n$n_0 + n_1 + n_2 = 3$.\n\nWe know that $n_0 \\geq b_0 = 1$, so $n_0 \\geq 1$. Similarly, $n_1 \\geq b_1 = 0$ and $n_2 \\geq b_2 = 0$. \n\nNow, let's consider the alternating sum of the number of critical points:\n\n$n_0 - n_1 + n_2$.\n\nSince $n_0 \\geq 1$, $n_1 \\geq 0$, and $n_2 \\geq 0$, we have:\n\n$n_0 - n_1 + n_2 \\geq 1 - 0 + 0 = 1$.\n\nOn the other hand, we know that $n_0 + n_1 + n_2 = 3$, so:\n\n$n_0 - n_1 + n_2 \\leq n_0 + n_1 + n_2 - 2n_1 = 3 - 2n_1 \\leq 3$.\n\nCombining these inequalities, we have:\n\n$1 \\leq n_0 - n_1 + n_2 \\leq 3$.\n\nSince $n_0 - n_1 + n_2$ is an integer, the only possibilities are $1$, $2$, or $3$. However, if $n_0 - n_1 + n_2 = 1$ or $2$, then we would have $n_1 + n_2 = 2$ or $1$, respectively. But this would contradict the fact that $n_1 \\geq 0$ and $n_2 \\geq 0$, since we would need at least one of them to be negative. Therefore, the only possibility is:\n\n$n_0 - n_1 + n_2 = 3$."
