    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will consider the possible elements in G and their orders.\n\nLet G be a group of order 4, and let a and b be elements of G. Since the order of G is 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n1. If G has an element of order 4, let's say a, then G is generated by a, and G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element. In this case, G is cyclic and isomorphic to C4. The isomorphism can be defined as φ: G → C4, where φ(a^k) = k (mod 4) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n2. If G does not have an element of order 4, then all non-identity elements must have order 2. Let a and b be two distinct non-identity elements in G. Then, a^2 = b^2 = e. Since G has 4 elements and we already have e, a, and b, the last element must be the product of a and b, denoted by c = ab. Note that c ≠ a and c ≠ b, otherwise, G would have less than 4 elements. Now, we have G = {e, a, b, c}, and we can verify that c^2 = (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = ee = e. Thus, all non-identity elements have order 2, and G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4. The isomorphism can be defined as φ: G → V4, where φ(e) = (0, 0), φ(a) = (1, 0), φ(b) = (0, 1), and φ(c) = (1, 1).\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 4 is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4. The possible isomorphisms are:\n\n1. For G isomorphic to C4: φ: G → C4, where φ(a^k) = k (mod 4) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n2. For G isomorphic to V4: φ: G → V4, where φ(e) = (0, 0), φ(a) = (1, 0), φ(b) = (0, 1), and φ(c) = (1, 1)."
