    "message_1": "A mathematical model for image processing and computer vision is given by the partial differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\right)$\n\nwhere $u(x,y,t)$ is the concentration of a chemical in an image, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $(x,y,t)$ are the spatial and temporal coordinates respectively.\n\nSuppose that we have an image of $256 \\times 256$ pixels with a chemical concentration of $u(x,y,0) = \\frac{x\\cdot y}{256^2}$ at time $t=0$. If the diffusion coefficient is $D=10$, calculate the concentration of the chemical at the center pixel $(128,128)$ after 10 seconds of diffusion.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution can be written as a product of functions of the form:\n\n$u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)$\n\nSubstituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\right) \\Rightarrow X(x)Y(y)\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = D\\left(X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y)\\right)T(t)$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = D\\left(\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}\\right)$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$ and $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -k^2$\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -\\frac{k^2}{D}$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\n1. $\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -k^2T(t)$\n2. $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$, where $\\lambda = -\\frac{k^2}{D}$\n3. $Y''(y) + \\mu Y(y) = 0$, where $\\mu = -\\frac{k^2}{D} - \\lambda$\n\nSolving these ODEs, we get:\n\n1. $T(t) = A\\exp(-k^2t)$\n2. $X(x) = B\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + C\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$\n3. $Y(y) = D\\cos(\\sqrt{\\mu}y) + E\\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu}y)$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as:\n\n$u(x, y, t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} A_{nm}\\exp(-k^2t)\\left(B_{nm}\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda_{nm}}x) + C_{nm}\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda_{nm}}x)\\right)\\left(D_{nm}\\cos(\\sqrt{\\mu_{nm}}y) + E_{nm}\\sin(\\sqrt{\\mu_{nm}}y)\\right)$\n\nApplying the initial condition $u(x, y, 0) = \\frac{xy}{256^2}$, we can find the coefficients $A_{nm}$, $B_{nm}$, $C_{nm}$, $D_{nm}$, and $E_{nm}$ using Fourier series. However, this process is quite involved and may not lead to a closed-form solution.\n\nInstead, we can use numerical methods to solve the given partial differential equation with the initial condition and then evaluate the solution at the center pixel $(128, 128)$ after 10 seconds of diffusion. This can be done using finite difference methods, finite element methods, or other numerical techniques available in various mathematical software packages."
