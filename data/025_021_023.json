    "message_2": "To find the rational points on the given elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 3x^2 + x$, we can use the method of finding integral points and then look for rational points by considering the projective closure of the curve.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation as $y^2 = x(x+1)(x+3)$. Now, consider the projective closure of the curve in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{Q})$ given by the homogeneous equation $Y^2Z = X^3 + 3X^2Z + XZ^2$. We can find the rational points on this curve by finding the integral points and then dehomogenizing.\n\nLet's find the integral points on the curve $y^2 = x(x+1)(x+3)$. We have three cases to consider:\n\n1. $x = 0$: In this case, we have $y^2 = 0$, so $y = 0$. Thus, we have the point $(0, 0)$.\n\n2. $x = -1$: In this case, we have $y^2 = (-1)(0)(2)$, so $y^2 = 0$, and $y = 0$. Thus, we have the point $(-1, 0)$.\n\n3. $x = -3$: In this case, we have $y^2 = (-3)(-2)(0)$, so $y^2 = 0$, and $y = 0$. Thus, we have the point $(-3, 0)$.\n\nNow, let's find the rational points on the projective curve $Y^2Z = X^3 + 3X^2Z + XZ^2$. We can dehomogenize by setting $Z = 1$ and looking for rational solutions $(X, Y)$.\n\n1. The point $(0, 0, 1)$ corresponds to the rational point $(0, 0)$.\n\n2. The point $(-1, 0, 1)$ corresponds to the rational point $(-1, 0)$.\n\n3. The point $(-3, 0, 1)$ corresponds to the rational point $(-3, 0)$.\n\nThus, the rational points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 3x^2 + x$ are $(0, 0)$, $(-1, 0)$, and $(-3, 0)$."
