    "message_1": "A transposition cipher has a key length of 6. If a message of 36 characters is encrypted using this cipher, how many rows and columns will the resulting ciphertext have?",
    "message_2": "In a transposition cipher with a key length of 6, the message is arranged into a grid with 6 columns. To find the number of rows, divide the total number of characters (36) by the number of columns (6).\n\n36 characters / 6 columns = 6 rows\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext will have 6 rows and 6 columns."
