    "message_2": "The perimeter of the Koch Island after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial Perimeter * (4/3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations and the initial perimeter is the perimeter of the equilateral triangle.\n\nFor the given problem, the initial perimeter is 3 * 100 = 300 units (since there are 3 sides of 100 units each in the equilateral triangle).\n\nNow, we need to find the perimeter after the 5th iteration:\n\nPerimeter = 300 * (4/3)^5\nPerimeter ≈ 300 * 16.296296\nPerimeter ≈ 4898.88 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch Island after the 5th iteration is approximately 4898.88 units."
