    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 10 cm and one angle of 30 degrees. What is the length of the opposite side?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the opposite side, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle.\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nWe are given the angle (30 degrees) and the hypotenuse (10 cm). We can plug these values into the sine function and solve for the opposite side.\n\nsin(30) = opposite side / 10\n\nThe sine of 30 degrees is 0.5 (you can find this value using a calculator or by knowing the common trigonometric values).\n\n0.5 = opposite side / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the opposite side:\n\nopposite side = 0.5 * 10\nopposite side = 5 cm\n\nSo, the length of the opposite side is 5 cm."
