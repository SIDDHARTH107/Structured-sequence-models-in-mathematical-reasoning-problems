    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (1, -2), we first need to find the derivative of the given function with respect to x.\n\nThe function is y = x^3 - 5x + 2.\n\nUsing the power rule, we find the derivative dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = 3x^2 - 5\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at the point (1, -2). To do this, we plug in the x-coordinate of the point into the derivative:\n\ndy/dx(1) = 3(1)^2 - 5 = 3 - 5 = -2\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (1, -2) is -2."
