    "message_1": "Let X be a smooth projective algebraic variety of dimension n over an algebraically closed field k. Suppose there is a birational morphism f: X --> Y to a smooth projective algebraic variety Y, such that the exceptional locus of f is a divisor D in X such that D is a normal crossing divisor. Suppose also that Y has no non-trivial invertible sheaves. If K_X is the canonical sheaf of X, then we can write K_X = f^*L + E where L is an invertible sheaf on Y and E is an effective divisor on X. Prove that L is unique and that h^0(X,K_X) = h^0(Y,L). \n\nEvaluate h^0(X,K_X) when X is a quintic threefold in P^4.",
    "message_2": "To prove the uniqueness of L, suppose there are two invertible sheaves L and L' on Y such that K_X = f^*L + E = f^*L' + E. Then f^*(L - L') = 0, which implies that L - L' is a trivial sheaf on Y since f is a birational morphism. Since Y has no non-trivial invertible sheaves, L - L' must be the trivial sheaf, and hence L = L'.\n\nNow we want to show that h^0(X, K_X) = h^0(Y, L). By the projection formula, we have:\n\nf_*K_X = f_*(f^*L + E) = f_*(f^*L) + f_*E = L ⊗ f_*O_X(E).\n\nSince f is a birational morphism, the higher direct images vanish, and we have:\n\nRf_*K_X = L ⊕ f_*O_X(E).\n\nApplying the derived functor of global sections, we get:\n\nRΓ(Y, Rf_*K_X) = RΓ(Y, L ⊕ f_*O_X(E)).\n\nBy the Leray spectral sequence, we have:\n\nE_2^{p, q} = H^p(Y, R^qf_*K_X) ⇒ H^n(X, K_X).\n\nSince the higher direct images vanish, the only non-zero term on the E_2 page is E_2^{0, n} = H^0(Y, L). Thus, the spectral sequence degenerates at E_2, and we have:\n\nH^n(X, K_X) = H^0(Y, L),\n\nwhich implies that h^0(X, K_X) = h^0(Y, L).\n\nNow, let X be a quintic threefold in P^4. Then X is given by the zero locus of a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5 in P^4. The canonical sheaf of X is given by K_X = O_X(-5 + 4) = O_X(-1). Since X is a Calabi-Yau threefold, we have h^0(X, K_X) = 0."
