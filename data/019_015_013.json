    "message_2": "To determine the truth of the statement using type theory, we need to analyze the properties of even and odd numbers and their sum.\n\nAn even number can be represented as 2n, where n is an integer. An odd number can be represented as 2m + 1, where m is also an integer.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of an even number x and an odd number y:\n\nx + y = (2n) + (2m + 1)\n\nBy combining the terms, we get:\n\nx + y = 2(n + m) + 1\n\nSince n and m are integers, their sum (n + m) is also an integer. Therefore, the expression 2(n + m) + 1 represents an odd number.\n\nSo, the statement \"For all natural numbers x and y, if x is even and y is odd, then x + y is odd\" is true."
