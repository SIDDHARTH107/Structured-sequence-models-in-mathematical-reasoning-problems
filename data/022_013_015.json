    "message_2": "To determine whether the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^3+z}$ is analytic, we first need to check if it is differentiable everywhere in its domain. The function is a rational function, so it will be analytic wherever its denominator is nonzero.\n\nLet's find the singularities of the function by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\n$z^3 + z = 0$\n\nWe can factor out a $z$:\n\n$z(z^2 + 1) = 0$\n\nThis equation has three solutions:\n\n1. $z = 0$\n2. $z^2 + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow z^2 = -1 \\Rightarrow z = \\pm i$\n\nSo, the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z^3+z}$ has singularities at $z = 0, \\pm i$. These are the points where the function is not analytic.\n\nHowever, the function is analytic everywhere else in the complex plane, since it is a rational function and differentiable everywhere except at its singularities."
