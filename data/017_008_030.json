    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C8 (cyclic group of order 8), Q8 (quaternion group), or D4 (dihedral group of order 8), we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 8, we can write it as a product of its prime factors: 8 = 2^3. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G, denoted by n_2, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides the order of G, so n_2 divides 8.\n2. n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n\nThe possible values for n_2 are 1 and 4. We will analyze both cases.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup of G. Let's call this subgroup H. Since H has order 2^3 = 8, it must be equal to G itself. Therefore, G is a p-group, and by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C8: A cyclic group of order 8.\n2. C4 × C2: A direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n\nHowever, C4 × C2 is isomorphic to D4, the dihedral group of order 8. To see this, consider the following correspondence:\n\n- The generator of C4 corresponds to a rotation of 90 degrees in D4.\n- The generator of C2 corresponds to a reflection in D4.\n\nThus, in this case, G is isomorphic to either C8 or D4.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 4\nIf there are four Sylow 2-subgroups, each of them has order 4. Let's pick one of them, say H. Since the index of H in G is 2 (i.e., |G:H| = 2), H must be a normal subgroup of G. Now, consider the quotient group G/H. It has order 8/4 = 2, so it must be isomorphic to C2, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nLet g be an element of G that is not in H. Then, G can be written as the union of the cosets H and gH. Since G/H is isomorphic to C2, we have (gH)^2 = H, which means that g^2 is in H. Moreover, since H is a normal subgroup, we can define a group operation on the set {1, g, h1, gh1, h2, gh2, h3, gh3}, where h1, h2, and h3 are distinct non-identity elements of H. This operation is given by:\n\n- Multiplying elements within H or within gH follows the group operation in H.\n- Multiplying an element in H by an element in gH or vice versa follows the rule (h * g) * h' = g * (h * h'), where h and h' are elements of H.\n\nThis group operation makes G a non-abelian group of order 8, and it can be shown that G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8. To see this, consider the following correspondence:\n\n- The elements 1, h1, h2, and h3 correspond to the quaternion units 1, i, j, and k, respectively.\n- The elements g, gh1, gh2, and gh3 correspond to the quaternion units -1, -i, -j, and -k, respectively.\n\nThus, in this case, G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C8, Q8, or D4."
