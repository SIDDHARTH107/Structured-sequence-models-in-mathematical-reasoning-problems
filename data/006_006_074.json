    "message_1": "In a basketball game, the probability of a player making a free throw is 0.75. If the player attempts 8 free throws, what is the probability that they will make all of them?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the player making all 8 free throws, we need to multiply the probability of making each individual free throw together. Since the probability of making a free throw is 0.75, we can calculate the probability as follows:\n\n0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 = (0.75)^8 = 0.100112915\n\nSo the probability of the player making all 8 free throws is approximately 0.1001 or 10.01%."
