    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3} - {2} = {1, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A Δ B) and {1}, denoted as (A Δ B) × {1}.\n\n(A Δ B) × {1} = {1, 3} × {1} = {(1, 1), (3, 1)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian products A × {1} and B × {1}.\n\nA × {1} = {1, 2} × {1} = {(1, 1), (2, 1)}\nB × {1} = {2, 3} × {1} = {(2, 1), (3, 1)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A × {1} and B × {1}, denoted as (A × {1}) Δ (B × {1}).\n\n(A × {1}) Δ (B × {1}) = ({(1, 1), (2, 1)} ∪ {(2, 1), (3, 1)}) - ({(1, 1), (2, 1)} ∩ {(2, 1), (3, 1)})\n= ({(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)} - {(2, 1)}) = {(1, 1), (3, 1)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two values we found:\n\n(A Δ B) × {1} = {(1, 1), (3, 1)}\n(A × {1}) Δ (B × {1}) = {(1, 1), (3, 1)}\n\nAs we can see, the two values are equal:\n\n(A Δ B) × {1} = (A × {1}) Δ (B × {1})\n\nHowever, this does not prove that the symmetric difference of two sets is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product, as we have only shown it for one specific case. To prove that the symmetric difference is not associative with respect to the Cartesian product, a counterexample or a more general proof would be needed."
