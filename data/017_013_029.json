    "message_2": "There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 18. We can classify them up to isomorphism as follows:\n\n1. The cyclic group of order 18, denoted by C_18 or Z_18.\n2. The semi-direct product of Z_3 and Z_6, denoted by Z_3 ⋊ Z_6.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how we arrive at these groups:\n\nThe prime factorization of 18 is 2 × 3^2. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, there are three abelian groups of order 18 up to isomorphism: Z_18, Z_2 × Z_9, and Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_3. However, Z_2 × Z_9 and Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_3 are isomorphic, so we only have two distinct abelian groups: Z_18 and Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_3.\n\nNow, we need to check for non-abelian groups of order 18. Since 18 = 2 × 3^2, we can consider the semi-direct product of Z_3 and Z_6. The semi-direct product is determined by the action of Z_6 on Z_3, which is given by a homomorphism from Z_6 to Aut(Z_3). Since |Aut(Z_3)| = 2, there are two possible homomorphisms: the trivial homomorphism and the non-trivial one.\n\nThe trivial homomorphism gives us the direct product Z_3 × Z_6, which is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_3 × Z_3. The non-trivial homomorphism gives us a non-abelian group, Z_3 ⋊ Z_6.\n\nThus, there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 18: the cyclic group Z_18 and the non-abelian group Z_3 ⋊ Z_6."
