    "message_2": "To find all possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 20, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 20 is 2^2 * 5. Thus, we have the following possibilities for the Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. A Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 and a Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5.\n2. A Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 and a Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, with the two subgroups intersecting trivially.\n\nCase 1: A Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 and a Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5.\n\nThere are two possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup: either it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C_4 or the Klein four-group V_4. The Sylow 5-subgroup is always isomorphic to the cyclic group C_5, as 5 is prime.\n\nIf the Sylow 2-subgroup is C_4, then the group is a semidirect product of C_4 and C_5. There is only one nontrivial homomorphism from C_5 to Aut(C_4), so there is only one nontrivial semidirect product in this case, which is the dihedral group D_10 of order 20.\n\nIf the Sylow 2-subgroup is V_4, then the group is a semidirect product of V_4 and C_5. There are no nontrivial homomorphisms from C_5 to Aut(V_4), so the only possibility in this case is the direct product V_4 x C_5.\n\nCase 2: A Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 and a Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5, with the two subgroups intersecting trivially.\n\nIn this case, the group is a direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup. As before, there are two possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup: C_4 or V_4. The Sylow 5-subgroup is C_5.\n\nIf the Sylow 2-subgroup is C_4, the group is the direct product C_4 x C_5, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C_20.\n\nIf the Sylow 2-subgroup is V_4, the group is the direct product V_4 x C_5, which is the same as in Case 1.\n\nThus, there are three isomorphism classes of groups of order 20:\n\n1. The cyclic group C_20.\n2. The dihedral group D_10.\n3. The direct product V_4 x C_5.\n\nExplicit examples of groups belonging to each class are:\n\n1. C_20: The additive group of integers modulo 20, denoted Z_20.\n2. D_10: The group of symmetries of a regular decagon, including rotations and reflections.\n3. V_4 x C_5: The direct product of the Klein four-group V_4 = {e, a, b, c} with the cyclic group C_5 = {1, x, x^2, x^3, x^4}, where e is the identity element."
