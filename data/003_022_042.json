    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n|u| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n|v| = √(5² + (-2)²) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n\nNow, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)\n\nTo find the dot product (u · v) using the components of the vectors, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = (3 * 5) + (4 * -2) = 15 - 8 = 7\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula for cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = 7 / (5 * √29)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product using the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ) = 5 * √29 * (7 / (5 * √29))\n\nThe terms 5 and √29 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nu · v = 7\n\nSo, the dot product of the two vectors u and v is 7."
