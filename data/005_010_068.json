    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces light bulbs with an average lifespan of 1000 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. A sample of 50 light bulbs is selected for testing using Bayesian statistics. If 20 bulbs in the sample last more than 1100 hours, what is the probability that a randomly selected bulb from this factory will last more than 1200 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Bayesian approach to update our prior beliefs about the distribution of lifespans of light bulbs produced by the factory. Our prior belief is that the lifespans are normally distributed with a mean of 1000 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours.\n\nLet's denote the lifespan of a light bulb as X. Our prior distribution is:\n\nP(X) ~ N(1000, 100^2)\n\nNow, we have observed a sample of 50 light bulbs, and 20 of them have a lifespan greater than 1100 hours. Let's denote this event as A. We want to find the probability that a randomly selected bulb will last more than 1200 hours, which we will denote as event B. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:\n\nP(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)\n\nFirst, we need to find P(A|B), the probability of observing 20 bulbs with a lifespan greater than 1100 hours given that a bulb lasts more than 1200 hours. If a bulb lasts more than 1200 hours, it certainly lasts more than 1100 hours. So, P(A|B) = 1.\n\nNext, we need to find P(B), the prior probability that a bulb lasts more than 1200 hours. To find this, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution:\n\nP(B) = 1 - P(X <= 1200) = 1 - Φ((1200 - 1000) / 100) = 1 - Φ(2)\n\nwhere Φ is the CDF of the standard normal distribution. Using a standard normal table or calculator, we find that Φ(2) ≈ 0.9772. Therefore, P(B) ≈ 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228.\n\nFinally, we need to find P(A), the probability of observing 20 bulbs with a lifespan greater than 1100 hours. This is a bit more complicated, as it involves a combination of probabilities. We can use the binomial distribution to model the number of bulbs with a lifespan greater than 1100 hours in a sample of 50:\n\nP(A) = C(50, 20) * p^20 * (1-p)^30\n\nwhere C(50, 20) is the number of combinations of choosing 20 bulbs out of 50, and p is the probability that a single bulb has a lifespan greater than 1100 hours:\n\np = 1 - P(X <= 1100) = 1 - Φ((1100 - 1000) / 100) = 1 - Φ(1)\n\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, we find that Φ(1) ≈ 0.8413. Therefore, p ≈ 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587.\n\nNow we can calculate P(A):\n\nP(A) ≈ C(50, 20) * (0.1587)^20 * (1 - 0.1587)^30 ≈ 0.0293\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate P(B|A) using Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(B|A) ≈ (1 * 0.0228) / 0.0293 ≈ 0.7785\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected bulb from this factory will last more than 1200 hours, given that 20 out of 50 bulbs in the sample last more than 1100 hours, is approximately 77.85%."
