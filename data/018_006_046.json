    "message_1": "Let U be a universal set containing 50 elements. Set A contains 20 elements. Determine the number of elements in A complement and show that the union of A and A complement equals U.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of elements in A complement, we need to subtract the number of elements in A from the total number of elements in the universal set U.\n\nA complement = U - A\n\nSince U has 50 elements and A has 20 elements:\n\nA complement = 50 - 20 = 30 elements\n\nNow, we need to show that the union of A and A complement equals U. By definition, the union of two sets is the set containing all elements that are in either of the sets. In this case, since A complement contains all the elements that are not in A, the union of A and A complement will contain all the elements in A and all the elements not in A, which is the entire universal set U.\n\nTherefore, A âˆª A complement = U."
