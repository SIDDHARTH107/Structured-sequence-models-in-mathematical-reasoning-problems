An agent knows that at least one box contains a blue ball, but doesn't know which one. The agent makes the following statements: \n- Box 1 does not contain a blue ball.\n- If Box 2 contains a blue ball, then Box 3 contains a blue ball as well.\n\nWhat is the probability that Box 2 contains a blue ball?",
    "message_2": "Let's list all the possible combinations of balls in the boxes, given the information provided:\n\n1. RBB (Red in Box 1, Blue in Box 2, Blue in Box 3)\n2. BRB (Blue in Box 1, Red in Box 2, Blue in Box 3)\n3. BBR (Blue in Box 1, Blue in Box 2, Red in Box 3)\n4. BBB (Blue in Box 1, Blue in Box 2, Blue in Box 3)\n\nSince the agent knows that at least one box contains a blue ball, we can eliminate the combination RRR (Red in Box 1, Red in Box 2, Red in Box 3).\n\nNow, let's consider the agent's statements:\n\n1. Box 1 does not contain a blue ball. This eliminates combination 2 and 3 (BRB and BBR).\n2. If Box 2 contains a blue ball, then Box 3 contains a blue ball as well. This statement is consistent with the remaining combinations (RBB and BBB).\n\nSo, we are left with two possible combinations: RBB and BBB.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that Box 2 contains a blue ball. In both of the remaining combinations (RBB and BBB), Box 2 contains a blue ball. Therefore, the probability that Box 2 contains a blue ball is:\n\n(Number of combinations with a blue ball in Box 2) / (Total number of remaining combinations) = 2/2 = 1\n\nSo, the probability that Box 2 contains a blue ball is 1, or 100%."
