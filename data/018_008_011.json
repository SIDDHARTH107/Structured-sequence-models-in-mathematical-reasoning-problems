    "message_2": "A x B represents the Cartesian product of sets A and B, which consists of all possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. \n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nSimilarly, B x A represents the Cartesian product of sets B and A, which consists of all possible ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A.\n\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements of A x B and B x A are not the same, even though they have the same number of elements. The order of the elements in the ordered pairs is different, which makes A x B and B x A distinct sets. Therefore, A x B is not equal to B x A."
