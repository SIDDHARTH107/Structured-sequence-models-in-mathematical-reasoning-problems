    "message_2": "To solve the equation log(x+7) - log(x-5) = 2.5, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can use the quotient rule for logarithms, which states that log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b). Applying this rule to our equation, we get:\n\nlog((x+7)/(x-5)) = 2.5\n\nNow, we want to remove the logarithm from the equation. To do this, we can use the property that if log(a) = b, then a = 10^b. Applying this to our equation, we get:\n\n(x+7)/(x-5) = 10^2.5\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx+7 = 10^2.5 * (x-5)\n\nx+7 = (10^2.5) * x - (10^2.5) * 5\n\nNow, we want to isolate x:\n\nx - (10^2.5) * x = -(10^2.5) * 5 - 7\n\nx(1 - 10^2.5) = -(10^2.5) * 5 - 7\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by (1 - 10^2.5):\n\nx = (-(10^2.5) * 5 - 7) / (1 - 10^2.5)\n\nx â‰ˆ 6.298\n\nSo, the solution for x is approximately 6.298."
