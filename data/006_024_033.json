    "message_1": "Suppose 20% of the flights from City A to City B have a delay of more than 2 hours. If a traveler has a round-trip ticket (i.e., travel from City A to City B and back), what is the probability that the traveler will experience a delay of more than 2 hours on at least one of the flights?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the traveler will experience a delay of more than 2 hours on at least one of the flights, we can use the complementary probability. That is, we will find the probability that the traveler does not experience a delay on both flights and subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of not having a delay on a single flight is 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.\n\nSince the flights are independent events, the probability of not having a delay on both flights is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(no delay on both flights) = P(no delay on flight A to B) * P(no delay on flight B to A) = 0.80 * 0.80 = 0.64.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least one delay) = 1 - P(no delay on both flights) = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36.\n\nSo, the probability that the traveler will experience a delay of more than 2 hours on at least one of the flights is 0.36 or 36%."
