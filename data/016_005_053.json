    "message_2": "The Cantor set construction involves removing the middle third of each line segment at each step. Let's analyze the process:\n\n1. Start with a line segment of length 27 cm.\n2. Remove the middle third (9 cm), leaving two segments of 9 cm each.\n3. Remove the middle third of each of the remaining segments (3 cm), leaving four segments of 3 cm each.\n4. Continue this process infinitely.\n\nAt each step, the number of segments doubles, and the length of each segment is divided by 3. To find the sum of the lengths of all the remaining line segments, we can use the geometric series formula:\n\nSum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere a is the initial term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, the initial term a is 27 cm, the common ratio r is 2/3 (since the length is multiplied by 2 and divided by 3 at each step), and the number of terms n approaches infinity.\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the term r^n approaches 0, so the formula simplifies to:\n\nSum = a / (1 - r)\n\nPlugging in the values for a and r, we get:\n\nSum = 27 / (1 - 2/3)\n\nSum = 27 / (1/3)\n\nSum = 27 * 3\n\nSum = 81 cm\n\nSo the sum of the lengths of all the remaining line segments in the Cantor set construction is 81 cm."
