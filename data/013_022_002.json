    "message_1": "Suppose two players, A and B, are playing the Dictator Game. Player A is given $100 and must decide how much, if any, to give to player B. Player B must accept whatever amount player A decides to give them, even if it is zero dollars. However, if player B rejects the offer, both players receive nothing. What is the optimal amount of money Player A should give to Player B to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, player B does not have the option to reject the offer. Player A simply decides how much money to give to player B, and player B must accept it. Therefore, to maximize their own payoff, player A should give $0 to player B and keep the entire $100 for themselves."
