    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given piecewise function, we first need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is defined over the interval [0, 4π], the Fourier series will be given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + ∑[a_n * cos(n * x / L) + b_n * sin(n * x / L)]\n\nwhere L = 2π (half of the period of the function), and the coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_0 = (1 / 2L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x / L) dx] from 0 to 4π\na_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x / L) dx] from 0 to 4π\nb_n = (1 / L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x / L) dx] from 0 to 4π\n\nSince the function is odd (f(-x) = -f(x)), all the a_n coefficients will be zero. Now we need to find the b_n coefficients:\n\nb_n = (1 / 2π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x / 2π) dx] from 0 to 4π\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts, one for 0 ≤ x < 2π (where f(x) = 2) and one for 2π ≤ x ≤ 4π (where f(x) = 0):\n\nb_n = (1 / 2π) * [∫[2 * sin(n * x / 2π) dx] from 0 to 2π + ∫[0 * sin(n * x / 2π) dx] from 2π to 4π]\n\nThe second integral is zero, so we only need to calculate the first one:\n\nb_n = (1 / 2π) * ∫[2 * sin(n * x / 2π) dx] from 0 to 2π\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\nb_n = (1 / 2π) * [-4π / n * cos(n * x / 2π)] from 0 to 2π\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\nb_n = (-4π / n) * [cos(n * 2π / 2π) - cos(n * 0 / 2π)] = (-4π / n) * [cos(n) - 1]\n\nNow we can write the Fourier series for the first four non-zero terms:\n\nf(x) = ∑[(-4π / n) * [cos(n) - 1] * sin(n * x / 2π)]\n\nFor n = 1, 3, 5, 7:\n\nf(x) ≈ (-4π / 1) * [cos(1) - 1] * sin(1 * x / 2π) + (-4π / 3) * [cos(3) - 1] * sin(3 * x / 2π) + (-4π / 5) * [cos(5) - 1] * sin(5 * x / 2π) + (-4π / 7) * [cos(7) - 1] * sin(7 * x / 2π)"
