    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, A and B. The company has a fixed budget of $20,000 to spend on production costs. Product A brings in a profit of $50 per unit, while product B brings in a profit of $75 per unit. The production cost of A is $10 per unit and the production cost of B is $15 per unit. Using cuckoo search algorithm, determine the optimal number of units of each product the company should produce to maximize their profit.",
    "message_2": "The Cuckoo Search Algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. However, it is quite complex and not suitable for a text-based environment. Instead, we can solve this problem using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (profit to maximize): P = 50x + 75y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Production cost constraint: 10x + 15y ≤ 20,000\n2. Non-negativity constraint: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we'll solve the production cost constraint for y:\n15y ≤ 20,000 - 10x\ny ≤ (20,000 - 10x) / 15\n\nNow, we'll find the critical points by setting x and y to 0:\n\n1. When x = 0:\ny ≤ (20,000 - 10(0)) / 15\ny ≤ 20,000 / 15\ny ≤ 1,333.33\n\n2. When y = 0:\nx ≤ 20,000 / 10\nx ≤ 2,000\n\nThe feasible region is a rectangle with vertices (0, 0), (0, 1,333.33), (2,000, 0), and the intersection point of the constraint line with the axes.\n\nTo find the intersection point, set y = 1,333.33 and solve for x:\n10x + 15(1,333.33) = 20,000\n10x + 20,000 = 20,000\nx = 0\n\nSo, the intersection point is (0, 1,333.33).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 50(0) + 75(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 1,333.33) = 50(0) + 75(1,333.33) = 100,000\n3. P(2,000, 0) = 50(2,000) + 75(0) = 100,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at points (0, 1,333.33) and (2,000, 0), with a profit of $100,000. However, since we need to produce whole units, we can't produce exactly 1,333.33 units of product B. Therefore, the company should produce either 1,333 units of product B and no units of product A or 2,000 units of product A and no units of product B. Both options will result in a profit close to $100,000. The company can choose either option based on other factors such as market demand or production capacity."
