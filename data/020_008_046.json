The distances between the warehouse and each retailer are given in the following table:\n\n| Retailer | Distance (miles) |\n|----------|------------------|\n| A        | 6                |\n| B        | 8                |\n| C        | 10               |\n| D        | 12               |\n\nThe company has three trucks, each with a capacity of 4000 pounds. The goods to be transported have the following weights and volumes:\n\n| Retailer | Weight (pounds) | Volume (cubic feet) |\n|----------|----------------|---------------------|\n| A        | 1800           | 200                 |\n| B        | 2200           | 250                 |\n| C        | 2600           | 300                 |\n| D        | 3000           | 350                 |\n\nWhat is the minimum total distance the trucks need to travel to deliver all the goods to the retailers, and how should the goods be allocated to the trucks to minimize the number of trips? Assume that each truck can go to any number of retailers, but can only deliver goods to one retailer per trip, and that the goods cannot be split between trucks. Use the nearest neighbor algorithm to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Using the nearest neighbor algorithm, we will start at the warehouse and visit the closest retailer first, then move to the next closest retailer from the current location, and so on. \n\n1. Start at the warehouse, the closest retailer is A (6 miles). Allocate goods for A to Truck 1.\n2. From retailer A, the closest retailer is B (8 miles). Allocate goods for B to Truck 2.\n3. From retailer B, the closest retailer is C (10 miles). Allocate goods for C to Truck 3.\n4. From retailer C, the closest retailer is D (12 miles). Since all trucks are already carrying goods, Truck 1 will have to return to the warehouse (10 miles) and then go to retailer D (12 miles).\n\nThe total distance traveled by the trucks is as follows:\n\n- Truck 1: Warehouse to A (6 miles) + A to Warehouse (6 miles) + Warehouse to D (12 miles) = 24 miles\n- Truck 2: Warehouse to B (8 miles) = 8 miles\n- Truck 3: Warehouse to C (10 miles) = 10 miles\n\nThe minimum total distance the trucks need to travel is 24 + 8 + 10 = 42 miles.\n\nThe allocation of goods to the trucks is as follows:\n\n- Truck 1: Retailer A (1800 pounds) and Retailer D (3000 pounds)\n- Truck 2: Retailer B (2200 pounds)\n- Truck 3: Retailer C (2600 pounds)"
