    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 |, X = | x |, B = | 11 |\n    | 1  5 |      | y |      | 23 |\n\nNow, we find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (3 * 5) - (2 * 1) = 15 - 2 = 13\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find A^(-1) using the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere adj(A) is the adjugate of A. The adjugate of A is found by swapping the diagonal elements and changing the sign of the off-diagonal elements:\n\nadj(A) = |  5 -2 |\n         | -1  3 |\n\nNow, we can find A^(-1):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/13) * |  5 -2 |\n                 | -1  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = |  5/13 -2/13 |\n         | -1/13  3/13 |\n\nNow, to find the values of x and y, we multiply A^(-1) by B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\n| x |   |  5/13 -2/13 |   | 11 |\n| y | = | -1/13  3/13 | * | 23 |\n\nMultiplying the matrices, we get:\n\n| x |   | (5/13 * 11) + (-2/13 * 23) |\n| y | = | (-1/13 * 11) + (3/13 * 23) |\n\n| x |   | 55/13 - 46/13 |\n| y | = | -11/13 + 69/13 |\n\n| x |   | 9/13 |\n| y | = | 58/13 |\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 9/13\ny = 58/13"
