The available working hours for each machine are as follows:\n\n- Machine X: 60 hours\n- Machine Y: 48 hours\n\nThe production time of each product on each machine is given below:\n\n| Product | Machine X (hours) | Machine Y (hours) |\n| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |\n| A       | 6                | 4                |\n| B       | 3                | 6                |\n\nThe company wants to maximize its profit. The profit per unit for each product is as follows:\n\n- Product A: $120\n- Product B: $150\n\nHow many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit given the available working hours for each machine?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the available working hours for each machine can be represented as follows:\n\nMachine X: 6x + 3y ≤ 60\nMachine Y: 4x + 6y ≤ 48\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 120x + 150y\n\nWe will now solve the system of inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n6x + 3y ≤ 60\n4x + 6y ≤ 48\n\nDivide the first inequality by 3:\n\n2x + y ≤ 20\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region by solving the system of equations:\n\n1) x = 0, y = 20\n2) y = 0, x = 10\n3) Intersection of 2x + y = 20 and 4x + 6y = 48\n\nTo find the intersection point, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation:\n\n4x + 6y - 4x - 2y = 48 - 40\n4y = 8\ny = 2\n\nNow, substitute y back into the first equation:\n\n2x + 2 = 20\n2x = 18\nx = 9\n\nSo, the intersection point is (9, 2).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1) Profit(0, 20) = 120(0) + 150(20) = $3000\n2) Profit(10, 0) = 120(10) + 150(0) = $1200\n3) Profit(9, 2) = 120(9) + 150(2) = $1380\n\nThe maximum profit is $3000 when producing 0 units of product A and 20 units of product B."
