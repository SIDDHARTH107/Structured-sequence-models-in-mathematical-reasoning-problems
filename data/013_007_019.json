    "message_1": "A group of 10 farmers in a village share a common land of 100 acres for grazing their cattle. Each farmer can graze 10 cattle on the land. However, additional cattle may damage the land's carrying capacity, leading to a tragedy of overgrazing. The cost of each farmer for maintaining a cow on the common land is $50 per year. Each cow yields $200 per year in milk and meat. What is the maximum number of cows that each farmer should graze on the common land to maximize their profit, while avoiding overgrazing?",
    "message_2": "To avoid overgrazing, the total number of cattle on the common land should not exceed the carrying capacity of the land. Since each farmer can graze 10 cattle on the land, the total carrying capacity is 10 farmers * 10 cattle per farmer = 100 cattle.\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit for each farmer. The profit per cow is the revenue from milk and meat minus the cost of maintaining the cow, which is $200 - $50 = $150 per cow.\n\nTo maximize their profit while avoiding overgrazing, each farmer should graze the maximum number of cattle allowed by the carrying capacity, which is 10 cattle per farmer. In this case, the profit for each farmer would be 10 cattle * $150 profit per cow = $1500 per farmer."
