The probability that the owner of a car also owns a motorcycle is 0.6, while the probability that a non-car owner owns a motorcycle is 0.1. If a resident is selected at random:\na) What is the probability that the selected resident owns both a car and a motorcycle?\nb) What is the probability that the selected resident owns a motorcycle given they do not own a car?",
    "message_2": "a) To find the probability that the selected resident owns both a car and a motorcycle, we can use the formula:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)\n\nwhere A is the event of owning a car, and B is the event of owning a motorcycle.\n\nP(A) = 0.4 (40% of residents own a car)\nP(B|A) = 0.6 (probability of owning a motorcycle given they own a car)\n\nP(A and B) = 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24\n\nSo, the probability that the selected resident owns both a car and a motorcycle is 0.24 or 24%.\n\nb) The probability that the selected resident owns a motorcycle given they do not own a car is already given in the problem statement:\n\nP(B|A') = 0.1\n\nwhere A' is the event of not owning a car.\n\nSo, the probability that the selected resident owns a motorcycle given they do not own a car is 0.1 or 10%."
