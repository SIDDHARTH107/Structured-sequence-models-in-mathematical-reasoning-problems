    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow in the given network, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will find augmenting paths and update the residual capacities until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path from s to t: s -> A -> D -> t. The minimum capacity along this path is 5. We update the residual capacities:\n\n   s -> A: 5/10\n   A -> D: 5/5\n   D -> t: 5/5\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path: s -> B -> C -> A -> D -> t. The minimum capacity along this path is 4. We update the residual capacities:\n\n   s -> B: 4/12\n   B -> C: 4/4\n   C -> A: 4/4\n   A -> D: 1/5 (5 - 4)\n   D -> t: 1/5 (5 - 4)\n\n3. We find another augmenting path: s -> B -> E -> D -> t. The minimum capacity along this path is 6. We update the residual capacities:\n\n   s -> B: 10/12 (4 + 6)\n   B -> E: 6/6\n   E -> D: 6/6\n   D -> t: 7/11 (1 + 6)\n\n4. Now, we cannot find any more augmenting paths from s to t.\n\nThe maximum flow from s to t is the sum of the flows along the paths we found: 5 + 4 + 6 = 15."
