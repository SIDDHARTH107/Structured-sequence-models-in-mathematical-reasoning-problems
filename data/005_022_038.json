Use the formula for the median given n values: the median is the [(n+1)/2]th value when n is odd, or the average of the [(n/2)th and (n/2+1)th] values when n is even. Use the formula for the quartiles defined as the 25th and 75th percentiles: Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data, and Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data. Then IQR is defined as IQR = Q3 - Q1.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the median of the data set. Since there are 10 values (n = 10), which is an even number, we will use the formula for the median when n is even: the average of the [(n/2)th and (n/2+1)th] values.\n\nn/2 = 10/2 = 5\nn/2 + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nThe 5th value is 10, and the 6th value is 12. So, the median is the average of these two values:\n\nMedian = (10 + 12) / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11\n\nNow, let's find the quartiles Q1 and Q3. Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data, and Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data.\n\nLower half: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\nUpper half: 12, 14, 16, 18, 20\n\nSince there are 5 values in each half (n = 5), which is an odd number, we will use the formula for the median when n is odd: the [(n+1)/2]th value.\n\nFor the lower half:\n(n+1)/2 = (5+1)/2 = 6/2 = 3\nThe 3rd value in the lower half is 6, so Q1 = 6.\n\nFor the upper half:\n(n+1)/2 = (5+1)/2 = 6/2 = 3\nThe 3rd value in the upper half is 16, so Q3 = 16.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the interquartile range (IQR) using the formula IQR = Q3 - Q1.\n\nIQR = 16 - 6 = 10\n\nSo, the median of the data set is 11, and the interquartile range (IQR) is 10."
