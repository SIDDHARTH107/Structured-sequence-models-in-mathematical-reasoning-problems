    "message_2": "To find the singular points on the algebraic surface given by the equation $x^3 - y^2 z = 0$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and find the points where all the partial derivatives vanish simultaneously.\n\nLet $F(x, y, z) = x^3 - y^2 z$. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 3x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = -2yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = -y^2$\n\nNow, we need to find the points $(x, y, z)$ where all these partial derivatives vanish simultaneously:\n\n$3x^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0$\n\n$-2yz = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$ or $z = 0$\n\n$-y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0$\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that the only singular point is $(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\nTo find the degree of the singularity at this point, we can use the Milnor number, which is defined as the dimension of the vector space of germs of holomorphic functions that are annihilated by the gradient of the function. In this case, we have:\n\n$\\nabla F = (3x^2, -2yz, -y^2)$\n\nAt the singular point $(0, 0, 0)$, the gradient is $(0, 0, 0)$. The Milnor number is the dimension of the space of germs of holomorphic functions that are annihilated by this gradient. Since the gradient is zero at the singular point, all germs of holomorphic functions are annihilated by the gradient. Therefore, the Milnor number (degree of the singularity) is infinite at the singular point $(0, 0, 0)$."
