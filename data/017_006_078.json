    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For any prime p dividing the order of a group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G, which is a subgroup of G with order p^n, where p^n is the highest power of p dividing the order of G.\n2. All Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted by n_p, divides the order of G, and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p).\n\nNow, let's consider the group G of order 77. Since 77 = 7 * 11, we have two prime factors, 7 and 11.\n\nLet's find the Sylow 7-subgroups and Sylow 11-subgroups of G.\n\nFor the Sylow 7-subgroups, we have p = 7 and n_7 divides 11 (by the third Sylow theorem). The only divisors of 11 are 1 and 11, and since n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we have n_7 = 1. Therefore, there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, say P_7, of order 7 in G.\n\nFor the Sylow 11-subgroups, we have p = 11 and n_11 divides 7 (by the third Sylow theorem). The only divisors of 7 are 1 and 7, and since n_11 ≡ 1 (mod 11), we have n_11 = 1. Therefore, there is a unique Sylow 11-subgroup, say P_11, of order 11 in G.\n\nSince both P_7 and P_11 are unique, they are both normal subgroups of G (as any conjugate of a unique subgroup must be the subgroup itself). Now, let's consider the product of these two subgroups, P_7P_11. Since P_7 and P_11 are normal, the product P_7P_11 is also a subgroup of G.\n\nThe order of P_7P_11 is |P_7||P_11|/|P_7 ∩ P_11|. Since P_7 and P_11 have relatively prime orders, their intersection is the identity element, so |P_7 ∩ P_11| = 1. Thus, the order of P_7P_11 is |P_7||P_11| = 7 * 11 = 77.\n\nSince P_7P_11 is a subgroup of G with the same order as G, we have P_7P_11 = G. Therefore, G is the product of its Sylow 7-subgroup and Sylow 11-subgroup.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1. If either P_7 or P_11 is the whole group G, then G is cyclic (as it would have the same order as one of its Sylow subgroups, which are cyclic by definition).\n2. If neither P_7 nor P_11 is the whole group G, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_7 and P_11, which are cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 7 and 11."
