    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the complex function f(z) = z / (z^2 + 1) centered at z = i, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z - i) and then expand it using partial fraction decomposition.\n\nf(z) = z / (z^2 + 1)\n     = z / [(z - i)(z + i)]\n\nNow, we perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\nz / [(z - i)(z + i)] = A / (z - i) + B / (z + i)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z - i)(z + i) gives:\n\nz = A(z + i) + B(z - i)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in convenient values of z:\n\nFor z = i:\n\ni = A(2i)\n\nA = 1/2\n\nFor z = -i:\n\n-i = B(-2i)\n\nB = 1/2\n\nNow, we rewrite f(z) using the values of A and B:\n\nf(z) = (1/2) / (z - i) + (1/2) / (z + i)\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of f(z) centered at z = i.\n\nNow, let's show that the series converges on the annulus 1 < |z - i| < √2.\n\nThe Laurent series converges if the function is analytic in the annulus. The function f(z) = z / (z^2 + 1) is analytic everywhere except at the singularities z = i and z = -i.\n\nLet's consider the annulus 1 < |z - i| < √2. The distance between z = i and z = -i is 2, so the annulus does not contain the singularity z = -i. The annulus is centered at z = i, and the distance from the center to the inner boundary is 1, which means that the singularity z = i is also not contained in the annulus.\n\nSince the function is analytic in the annulus and the singularities are not contained in the annulus, the Laurent series converges on the annulus 1 < |z - i| < √2."
