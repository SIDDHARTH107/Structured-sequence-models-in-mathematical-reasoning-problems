    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular polygon, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (Perimeter * Apothem) / 2\n\nFirst, we need to find the perimeter and the apothem of the polygon.\n\nThe perimeter of a regular polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since the polygon has 12 sides, each with a length of 6 cm, the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 12 * 6 = 72 cm\n\nNext, we need to find the apothem. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. We can find the apothem by using the following formula:\n\nApothem = (Side length) / (2 * tan(180° / n))\n\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\nIn this case, n = 12, and the side length is 6 cm. So, we have:\n\nApothem = 6 / (2 * tan(180° / 12))\nApothem ≈ 6 / (2 * tan(15°))\nApothem ≈ 6 / (2 * 0.2679)\nApothem ≈ 6 / 0.5358\nApothem ≈ 11.1962 cm\n\nNow that we have the perimeter and the apothem, we can find the area of the polygon:\n\nArea = (Perimeter * Apothem) / 2\nArea = (72 * 11.1962) / 2\nArea ≈ 403.4112 cm²\n\nThe area of the regular polygon is approximately 403.41 cm²."
