    "message_1": "A rectangular sheet of cardboard measuring 16 inches by 24 inches has squares measuring 2 inches on each corner cut out. The sides are then folded to make a rectangular box with no top. What is the maximum volume of the box?",
    "message_2": "After cutting out the 2-inch squares from each corner, the dimensions of the cardboard will be reduced to 12 inches by 20 inches. When the sides are folded up to form the box, the height of the box will be 2 inches (the size of the cut-out squares).\n\nThe dimensions of the box will be:\nLength: 20 inches\nWidth: 12 inches\nHeight: 2 inches\n\nTo find the volume of the box, multiply the length, width, and height:\n\nVolume = Length × Width × Height\nVolume = 20 inches × 12 inches × 2 inches\nVolume = 480 cubic inches\n\nThe maximum volume of the box is 480 cubic inches."
