    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a vertex. In other words, a perfect matching pairs up all the vertices in the graph.\n\nFor a graph to have a perfect matching, it must satisfy the Tutte-Berge formula. The Tutte-Berge formula states that for a graph G with n vertices, the size of the maximum matching M(G) is at least (n - o(G))/2, where o(G) is the odd components of G (i.e., the number of connected components with an odd number of vertices).\n\nLet's apply the Tutte-Berge formula to the given graph G with 6 vertices and 7 edges:\n\n1. Since G has 6 vertices, it must have an even number of vertices to have a perfect matching.\n2. Let's consider the worst-case scenario for the number of odd components, which is when G has two connected components, one with 3 vertices and the other with 3 vertices. In this case, o(G) = 2.\n3. Applying the Tutte-Berge formula, we get M(G) ≥ (6 - 2)/2 = 2.\n\nSince the Tutte-Berge formula only provides a lower bound for the size of the maximum matching, it is not enough to conclude whether G has a perfect matching or not. We need to analyze the graph further.\n\nLet's consider the degree of the vertices in G. Since G has 6 vertices and 7 edges, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or higher. Let's call this vertex A. Now, consider the three vertices connected to A. Since there are only two other vertices left in the graph, at least one of these three vertices must be connected to another vertex in the set of three. This forms a cycle of length 4 or more.\n\nNow, let's apply the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In our case, the sum of the degrees is 2 * 7 = 14. Since we have 6 vertices, the average degree of a vertex in G is 14/6 ≈ 2.33. This means that there must be at least one more vertex with a degree of 3 or higher.\n\nWith this information, we can now construct a graph G that has a perfect matching:\n\n1. Start with a cycle of length 4, which has a perfect matching.\n2. Add a vertex B connected to two vertices in the cycle, which maintains the perfect matching.\n3. Add a vertex C connected to vertex A and one of the vertices connected to B, which maintains the perfect matching.\n\nIn this graph G, every vertex has a degree of at least 2, and there are two vertices with a degree of 3. This graph has 6 vertices, 7 edges, and a perfect matching.\n\nTherefore, it is possible for a graph G with 6 vertices and 7 edges to have a perfect matching."
