    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic (χ) of a genus-g orientable surface can be calculated using the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nFor a genus-2 orientable surface, we have g = 2. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of a genus-2 orientable surface is -2."
