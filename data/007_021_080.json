    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding non-trivial factors of a composite number. Let's apply the algorithm to find the factors of the number 6469693230.\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) and an initial value x0. A common choice for f(x) is f(x) = x^2 + 1 (mod N), where N is the number we want to factor. Let's choose x0 = 2.\n\n2. Initialize two variables x and y, both initially set to x0. In our case, x = y = 2.\n\n3. Iterate the following steps until a non-trivial factor is found:\n   a. Update x by applying the function f(x) once: x = f(x) (mod N).\n   b. Update y by applying the function f(x) twice: y = f(f(y)) (mod N).\n   c. Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute difference between x and y, and N: d = GCD(|x - y|, N).\n   d. If d is not equal to 1 and not equal to N, then d is a non-trivial factor of N.\n\nLet's perform the iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) % 6469693230 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) % 6469693230 = 26\nd = GCD(|5 - 26|, 6469693230) = GCD(21, 6469693230) = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) % 6469693230 = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(26) = (26^2 + 1) % 6469693230 = 677\nd = GCD(|26 - 677|, 6469693230) = GCD(651, 6469693230) = 1\n\nIteration 3:\nx = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) % 6469693230 = 677\ny = f(f(y)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) % 6469693230 = 458330\nd = GCD(|677 - 458330|, 6469693230) = GCD(457653, 6469693230) = 23\n\nWe found a non-trivial factor, d = 23. Now we can divide 6469693230 by 23 to find the other factor:\n\n6469693230 / 23 = 281450134\n\nSo, the factors of 6469693230 are 23 and 281450134."
