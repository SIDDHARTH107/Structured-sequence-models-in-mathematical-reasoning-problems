    "message_1": "On a certain road, the probability of a car accident occurring on any given day is 0.1. If there are 50 cars traveling on the road each day, what is the probability that there will be at least 1 car accident in a week (7 days)?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one car accident in a week, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring in a week and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no accident occurring for a single car in a day is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9. Since there are 50 cars, the probability of no accidents occurring on the road in a single day is (0.9)^50.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of no accidents occurring for the entire week (7 days). This would be the probability of no accidents in a single day raised to the power of 7: ((0.9)^50)^7.\n\nFinally, to find the probability of at least one accident occurring in a week, we subtract the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\n1 - ((0.9)^50)^7 â‰ˆ 0.99957\n\nSo, the probability of at least one car accident occurring in a week is approximately 0.99957 or 99.957%."
