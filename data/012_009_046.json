    "message_2": "To determine the degree sequence of the graph, we need to find the degrees of the remaining two vertices. Let's denote the degrees of the seven vertices as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, and d7. We know that:\n\nd1 = 2\nd2 = 4\nd3 = 4\nd4 = 5\nd5 = 6\n\nThe sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges (by the Handshaking Lemma):\n\nd1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 = 2 * E\n\nWe can substitute the known values:\n\n2 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 6 + d6 + d7 = 2 * E\n\n21 + d6 + d7 = 2 * E\n\nSince G is a simple graph, it cannot have loops or multiple edges. The maximum degree of a vertex in a simple graph with 7 vertices is 6 (it can be connected to all other vertices). Therefore, d6 and d7 must be less than or equal to 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values for d6 and d7:\n\n1. If d6 = 6 and d7 = 6, then the sum of degrees would be 21 + 6 + 6 = 33, which is odd, so this is not possible (the sum of degrees must be even).\n\n2. If d6 = 6 and d7 = 5, then the sum of degrees would be 21 + 6 + 5 = 32, which is even. In this case, the degree sequence would be (2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5). This is a valid degree sequence since it satisfies the Handshaking Lemma and the graph can be constructed with these degrees.\n\nTherefore, the degree sequence of the graph is (2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5)."
