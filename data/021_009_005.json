    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: X and Y. The profit from each unit of X and Y is $10 and $15, respectively. The production of each unit of X requires 2 hours of labor while the production of each unit of Y requires 3 hours of labor. The company has 400 hours of labor available per week. How many units of each product should the company produce each week to maximize their profit? Use the gradient descent method to solve the optimization problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the gradient descent method, we first need to set up the objective function and constraints. Let x be the number of units of product X produced per week, and y be the number of units of product Y produced per week. The objective function to maximize is the total profit:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nSubject to the constraint:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 400 (labor hours constraint)\n\nNow, let's use the method of Lagrange multipliers to incorporate the constraint into the objective function. Define the Lagrangian function L(x, y, λ) as follows:\n\nL(x, y, λ) = 10x + 15y + λ(400 - 2x - 3y)\n\nTo find the critical points, we need to take the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = 10 - 2λ = 0\n∂L/∂y = 15 - 3λ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = 400 - 2x - 3y = 0\n\nSolving the first two equations for λ, we get:\n\nλ = 5\nλ = 5\n\nSince both equations give the same value for λ, we can use the third equation to find the optimal values for x and y:\n\n400 - 2x - 3y = 0\n\nSubstituting λ = 5 into the first and second equations, we get:\n\nx = 100\ny = 100\n\nHowever, this solution does not satisfy the labor constraint (2x + 3y > 400). Therefore, we need to find the optimal solution on the boundary of the constraint. Let's consider two cases:\n\n1) x = 0 (only produce product Y)\nIn this case, the labor constraint becomes 3y ≤ 400. The maximum integer value of y that satisfies this constraint is y = floor(400/3) = 133. The profit in this case is P(0, 133) = $1995.\n\n2) y = 0 (only produce product X)\nIn this case, the labor constraint becomes 2x ≤ 400. The maximum integer value of x that satisfies this constraint is x = floor(400/2) = 200. The profit in this case is P(200, 0) = $2000.\n\nComparing the profits in both cases, we find that the company should produce 200 units of product X and 0 units of product Y per week to maximize their profit, which will be $2000."
