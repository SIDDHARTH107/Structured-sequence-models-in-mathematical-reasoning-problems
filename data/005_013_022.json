They collected the following data:\n\n- Employee 1: Salary = $50,000, Education = 4 years, Work Experience = 3 years\n- Employee 2: Salary = $75,000, Education = 6 years, Work Experience = 5 years\n- Employee 3: Salary = $45,000, Education = 2 years, Work Experience = 1 year\n- Employee 4: Salary = $60,000, Education = 5 years, Work Experience = 3 years\n- Employee 5: Salary = $80,000, Education = 7 years, Work Experience = 6 years\n\nUsing multivariate analysis, what is the relationship between salary, education, and work experience?",
    "message_2": "To analyze the relationship between salary, education, and work experience, we can use a multivariate regression analysis. In this case, we will use a multiple linear regression model, which can be represented as:\n\nSalary = β0 + β1 * Education + β2 * Work Experience + ε\n\nWhere β0, β1, and β2 are the coefficients we want to estimate, and ε is the error term.\n\nFirst, let's organize the data into matrices:\n\nX (independent variables) = [[1, 4, 3],\n                             [1, 6, 5],\n                             [1, 2, 1],\n                             [1, 5, 3],\n                             [1, 7, 6]]\n\nY (dependent variable) = [[50000],\n                          [75000],\n                          [45000],\n                          [60000],\n                          [80000]]\n\nWe can estimate the coefficients (β) using the following formula:\n\nβ = (X'X)^(-1)X'Y\n\nWhere X' is the transpose of matrix X, and (X'X)^(-1) is the inverse of the matrix product X'X.\n\nFirst, let's calculate X'X:\n\nX'X = [[5, 24, 18],\n       [24, 110, 74],\n       [18, 74, 62]]\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of X'X:\n\n(X'X)^(-1) = [[ 3.6667, -1.3333,  0.6667],\n              [-1.3333,  0.6667, -0.3333],\n              [ 0.6667, -0.3333,  0.3333]]\n\nNext, let's calculate X'Y:\n\nX'Y = [[365000],\n       [1340000],\n       [1030000]]\n\nFinally, let's find the coefficients β:\n\nβ = (X'X)^(-1)X'Y = [[ 3.6667, -1.3333,  0.6667],\n                     [-1.3333,  0.6667, -0.3333],\n                     [ 0.6667, -0.3333,  0.3333]] * [[365000],\n                                                     [1340000],\n                                                     [1030000]]\n\nβ = [[-8500],\n     [ 9250],\n     [ 4750]]\n\nSo, our multiple linear regression model is:\n\nSalary = -8500 + 9250 * Education + 4750 * Work Experience\n\nThis model suggests that, on average, each additional year of education is associated with an increase of $9,250 in salary, and each additional year of work experience is associated with an increase of $4,750 in salary. Keep in mind that this is a simple analysis with a small sample size, and more data would be needed to make more accurate conclusions."
