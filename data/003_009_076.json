    "message_1": "A triangle has one angle of measurement 45 degrees and another angle of 60 degrees. The distance between the two non-right angles of the triangle is 8 cm. What is the perimeter of the triangle, rounded to the nearest hundredth, if the longest side has a length of 12 cm?",
    "message_2": "Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can find the third angle by subtracting the given angles from 180:\n\n180 - 45 - 60 = 75 degrees\n\nNow we have a triangle with angles 45, 60, and 75 degrees. Since the longest side (12 cm) is opposite the largest angle (75 degrees), we can use the Law of Sines to find the other two sides:\n\nLet a be the side opposite the 45-degree angle, and b be the side opposite the 60-degree angle.\n\na/sin(45) = b/sin(60) = 12/sin(75)\n\nFirst, let's find a:\n\na/sin(45) = 12/sin(75)\na = (12 * sin(45))/sin(75)\n\nNow, let's find b:\n\nb/sin(60) = 12/sin(75)\nb = (12 * sin(60))/sin(75)\n\nNow we can calculate the values of a and b:\n\na ≈ (12 * sin(45))/sin(75) ≈ 8.49 cm\nb ≈ (12 * sin(60))/sin(75) ≈ 10.39 cm\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter ≈ 8.49 + 10.39 + 12 ≈ 30.88 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle, rounded to the nearest hundredth, is approximately 30.88 cm."
