    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x² * cos(x) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together:\n\nu(x) = x²\nv(x) = cos(x)\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of these individual functions:\n\nu'(x) = 2x\nv'(x) = -sin(x)\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for u'(x), v(x), u(x), and v'(x) into the formula:\n\nf'(x) = (2x)(cos(x)) + (x²)(-sin(x))\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 2x*cos(x) - x²*sin(x)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = x² * cos(x) is f'(x) = 2x*cos(x) - x²*sin(x)."
