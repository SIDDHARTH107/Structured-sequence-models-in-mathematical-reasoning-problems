    "message_2": "To find the steady-state output response of the system to a sinusoidal input using the Fourier transform, we first need to represent the input signal in the frequency domain. The input signal is given as a sinusoidal function with an amplitude of 5 and a frequency of 2 Hz:\n\nx(t) = 5 * sin(2 * pi * 2 * t)\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the input signal, we get:\n\nX(jω) = 5 * π * [δ(ω - 4π) - δ(ω + 4π)]\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function and ω = 2πf.\n\nNow, we need to find the frequency-domain representation of the transfer function G(s). To do this, we replace s with jω in the transfer function:\n\nG(jω) = 10(jω) / ((jω)^2 + 4(jω) + 3)\n\nNow, we can find the output signal in the frequency domain by multiplying the input signal's Fourier transform with the transfer function:\n\nY(jω) = G(jω) * X(jω)\n\nY(jω) = 5 * π * [G(j(ω - 4π)) - G(j(ω + 4π))]\n\nTo find the steady-state output response, we take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(jω):\n\ny(t) = F^(-1){Y(jω)}\n\ny(t) = 5 * π * [g(t) * cos(4πt) - g(-t) * cos(4πt)]\n\nwhere g(t) is the inverse Laplace transform of G(s). To find g(t), we can use partial fraction decomposition on G(s):\n\nG(s) = 10s / (s^2 + 4s + 3) = 10s / ((s + 1)(s + 3))\n\nUsing partial fraction decomposition, we get:\n\nG(s) = A / (s + 1) + B / (s + 3)\n\nSolving for A and B, we find that A = 10 and B = -10. Therefore,\n\nG(s) = 10 / (s + 1) - 10 / (s + 3)\n\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform, we get:\n\ng(t) = 10 * e^(-t) - 10 * e^(-3t)\n\nNow, we can substitute g(t) and g(-t) into the expression for y(t):\n\ny(t) = 5 * π * [(10 * e^(-t) - 10 * e^(-3t)) * cos(4πt) - (10 * e^(t) - 10 * e^(3t)) * cos(4πt)]\n\nThis is the steady-state output response of the system to the sinusoidal input with an amplitude of 5 and a frequency of 2 Hz."
