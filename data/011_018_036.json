    "message_1": "A school has 18 students who want to participate in a field trip. The teacher decides to split the students into groups of 6 for the trip. How many different ways can the teacher create these groups of 6 students?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of ways the teacher can create groups of 6 students, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (18), k is the number of students in each group (6), and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to create the first group of 6 students:\n\nC(18, 6) = 18! / (6!(18-6)!) = 18! / (6!12!) = 18,564\n\nNow, there are 12 students left. We need to find the number of ways to create the second group of 6 students:\n\nC(12, 6) = 12! / (6!(12-6)!) = 12! / (6!6!) = 924\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to create the groups, we multiply the number of ways to create the first group by the number of ways to create the second group:\n\nTotal ways = 18,564 * 924 = 17,145,616\n\nHowever, since there are 3 groups and they are indistinguishable, we need to divide the total ways by the number of groups (3!) to avoid overcounting:\n\nFinal answer = 17,145,616 / 3! = 17,145,616 / 6 = 2,857,602\n\nSo, there are 2,857,602 different ways the teacher can create the groups of 6 students."
