    "message_1": "Consider a one-dimensional heat conduction problem in a thin rod of length 1 unit. Suppose that the rod has a thermal conductivity of 3 units and is initially at a uniform temperature of 5 units. At time zero, the left end of the rod is brought into contact with a heat source that maintains a temperature of 20 units, while the right end of the rod is kept at a constant temperature of 10 units. Using the Fourier transform, calculate the temperature at any point in the rod at any time after the heat source is applied.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the given boundary and initial conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u(x,t) / ∂t = k * ∂²u(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and k is the thermal conductivity.\n\nBoundary conditions:\nu(0,t) = 20\nu(1,t) = 10\n\nInitial condition:\nu(x,0) = 5\n\nFirst, we will find the steady-state solution (i.e., the solution when t → ∞) by setting ∂u(x,t) / ∂t = 0:\n\n0 = k * ∂²u(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n\nu(x) = Ax + B\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n20 = A * 0 + B => B = 20\n10 = A * 1 + 20 => A = -10\n\nSo, the steady-state solution is:\n\nu(x) = -10x + 20\n\nNow, we will find the transient solution (i.e., the solution that decays to zero as t → ∞) by subtracting the steady-state solution from the original equation:\n\nv(x,t) = u(x,t) - (-10x + 20)\n\nThe equation for v(x,t) becomes:\n\n∂v(x,t) / ∂t = k * ∂²v(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwith the following boundary and initial conditions:\n\nv(0,t) = 0\nv(1,t) = 0\nv(x,0) = 5 - (-10x + 20)\n\nNow, we will use the Fourier transform to solve this equation. We will use the sine series since the boundary conditions are homogeneous:\n\nv(x,t) = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx) * exp(-k * (nπ)² * t)]\n\nThe coefficients B_n can be found using the initial condition:\n\n5 - (-10x + 20) = ∑[B_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nB_n = 2 * ∫[(-10x + 15) * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\nB_n = (20/nπ) * (1 - (-1)^n) - (10/n²π²) * (1 - cos(nπ))\n\nNow, we can write the solution for v(x,t):\n\nv(x,t) = ∑[((20/nπ) * (1 - (-1)^n) - (10/n²π²) * (1 - cos(nπ))) * sin(nπx) * exp(-k * (nπ)² * t)]\n\nFinally, we can find the solution for u(x,t) by adding the steady-state solution:\n\nu(x,t) = -10x + 20 + ∑[((20/nπ) * (1 - (-1)^n) - (10/n²π²) * (1 - cos(nπ))) * sin(nπx) * exp(-k * (nπ)² * t)]\n\nThis equation gives the temperature at any point x in the rod at any time t after the heat source is applied, with k = 3."
