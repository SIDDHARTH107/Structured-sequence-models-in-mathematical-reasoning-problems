    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent, $\\lambda$, describes the rate at which nearby trajectories in a dynamical system diverge or converge. In this case, we are given a positive Lyapunov exponent ($\\lambda = 0.4$), which indicates that the trajectories are diverging.\n\nThe formula relating the Lyapunov exponent, the initial distance $d_0$, and the distance $d_n$ after $n$ iterations is:\n\n$$d_n = d_0 \\cdot e^{\\lambda n}$$\n\nWe are given that the distance doubles after 10 iterations, so we can write:\n\n$$2d_0 = d_0 \\cdot e^{\\lambda \\cdot 10}$$\n\nWe can solve for $\\lambda$:\n\n$$2 = e^{\\lambda \\cdot 10}$$\n\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln{2}}{10}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the distance after 20 iterations, $d_{20}$:\n\n$$d_{20} = d_0 \\cdot e^{\\lambda \\cdot 20}$$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\lambda$:\n\n$$d_{20} = 0.01 \\cdot e^{\\frac{\\ln{2}}{10} \\cdot 20}$$\n\n$$d_{20} = 0.01 \\cdot e^{\\ln{2} \\cdot 2}$$\n\nSince $e^{\\ln{2}} = 2$, we have:\n\n$$d_{20} = 0.01 \\cdot 2^2$$\n\n$$d_{20} = 0.01 \\cdot 4$$\n\n$$d_{20} = 0.04$$\n\nSo the estimated value of the separation at $n=20$ iterations is $0.04$."
