    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the space $X$, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. First, we need to choose two open sets $U$ and $V$ that cover $X$ and whose intersection is simply connected. Let $U$ be an open set containing $p$ and $q$ and $V$ be an open set containing the rest of the circle $S^1$. Then, $U \\cap V$ is an open arc in $S^1$ and is simply connected.\n\nNow, let's analyze the fundamental groups of $U$ and $V$. The space $U$ is homeomorphic to a disk, so its fundamental group is trivial: $\\pi_1(U) = \\{1\\}$. The space $V$ is homeomorphic to a circle with two points identified, which is also homeomorphic to a circle. Therefore, $\\pi_1(V) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nBy the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, the fundamental group of $X$ is given by the free product of $\\pi_1(U)$ and $\\pi_1(V)$ with the normal subgroup generated by the image of $\\pi_1(U \\cap V)$ under the homomorphisms induced by the inclusions $U \\cap V \\hookrightarrow U$ and $U \\cap V \\hookrightarrow V$. Since $U \\cap V$ is simply connected, its fundamental group is trivial, and the normal subgroup is also trivial.\n\nThus, the fundamental group of $X$ is the free product of $\\pi_1(U)$ and $\\pi_1(V)$, which is just $\\pi_1(V)$ since $\\pi_1(U)$ is trivial:\n\n$$\\pi_1(X) = \\pi_1(U) * \\pi_1(V) = \\{1\\} * \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}.$$\n\nSo the fundamental group of the space $X$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$."
