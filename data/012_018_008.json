    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph, we need to ensure that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least one isolated vertex or separate the graph into two or more disconnected components.\n\nLet's consider the minimum degree (the smallest number of edges connected to a vertex) of the graph. By the Pigeonhole Principle, since there are 7 vertices and 12 edges, there must be a vertex with a degree of at least ceil(2 * 12 / 7) = 4.\n\nTo disconnect the graph, we can focus on the vertex with the minimum degree. By removing all the edges connected to that vertex, we can create an isolated vertex, thus disconnecting the graph.\n\nSince the minimum degree is 4, we need to remove at least 4 edges to disconnect the graph. Therefore, the minimum number of edges that need to be removed is 4."
