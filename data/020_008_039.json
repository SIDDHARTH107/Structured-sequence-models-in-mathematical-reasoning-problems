    "message_1": "A company wants to connect its five warehouses through a network of roads. Each warehouse has a specific supply of goods that it needs to send to the other warehouses. The table below shows the supply and demand of goods for each warehouse. \n\n| Warehouse | Supply | Demand |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| 1         | 50     | 70     |\n| 2         | 60     | 40     |\n| 3         | 40     | 50     |\n| 4         | 30     | 20     |\n| 5         | 20     | 30     |\n\nDetermine the optimal way to connect the warehouses while minimizing the total cost of constructing roads. The cost of constructing roads between the warehouses is given in the following table.\n\n|      | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 1    | -   | 25  | 40  | 20  | 35  |\n| 2    | 25  | -   | 30  | 34  | 15  |\n| 3    | 40  | 30  | -   | 22  | 5   |\n| 4    | 20  | 34  | 22  | -   | 10  |\n| 5    | 35  | 15  | 5   | 10  | -   |\n\nHow much will it cost the company to construct the optimal network of roads between the warehouses?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal network of roads between the warehouses, we can use the minimum spanning tree algorithm, such as Kruskal's algorithm. The minimum spanning tree will connect all the warehouses with the minimum total cost.\n\nFirst, let's list all the edges (roads) and their costs in ascending order:\n\n1-4: 20\n3-5: 5\n4-5: 10\n2-5: 15\n1-2: 25\n3-4: 22\n2-3: 30\n1-5: 35\n1-3: 40\n2-4: 34\n\nNow, we will apply Kruskal's algorithm:\n\n1. Start with an empty set of edges.\n2. Add the edge with the lowest cost (1-4: 20) to the set.\n3. Add the next lowest cost edge (3-5: 5) to the set.\n4. Add the next lowest cost edge (4-5: 10) to the set. However, this would create a cycle with the existing edges, so we skip this edge.\n5. Add the next lowest cost edge (2-5: 15) to the set.\n6. Add the next lowest cost edge (1-2: 25) to the set.\n7. Add the next lowest cost edge (3-4: 22) to the set. However, this would create a cycle with the existing edges, so we skip this edge.\n8. Add the next lowest cost edge (2-3: 30) to the set. However, this would create a cycle with the existing edges, so we skip this edge.\n\nNow we have a minimum spanning tree with the following edges and costs:\n\n1-4: 20\n3-5: 5\n2-5: 15\n1-2: 25\n\nThe total cost of constructing the optimal network of roads between the warehouses is 20 + 5 + 15 + 25 = 65."
