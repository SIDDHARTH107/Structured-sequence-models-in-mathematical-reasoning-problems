    "message_2": "To find the height of the ball after 3 seconds, we need to find the position function of the ball with respect to time. We are given the initial velocity (45 m/s) and the acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s²).\n\nLet s(t) be the position function of the ball with respect to time, v(t) be the velocity function, and a(t) be the acceleration function. We are given:\n\na(t) = -9.8 m/s² (constant acceleration due to gravity)\n\nTo find the velocity function, we need to integrate the acceleration function with respect to time:\n\nv(t) = ∫a(t) dt = ∫(-9.8) dt = -9.8t + C₁\n\nWe know that the initial velocity is 45 m/s, so we can find the constant C₁:\n\nv(0) = 45 = -9.8(0) + C₁\nC₁ = 45\n\nSo the velocity function is:\n\nv(t) = -9.8t + 45\n\nNow we need to find the position function by integrating the velocity function:\n\ns(t) = ∫v(t) dt = ∫(-9.8t + 45) dt = -4.9t² + 45t + C₂\n\nWe can assume that the initial position of the ball is 0 (s(0) = 0), so we can find the constant C₂:\n\ns(0) = 0 = -4.9(0)² + 45(0) + C₂\nC₂ = 0\n\nSo the position function is:\n\ns(t) = -4.9t² + 45t\n\nNow we can find the height of the ball after 3 seconds by plugging t = 3 into the position function:\n\ns(3) = -4.9(3)² + 45(3) = -4.9(9) + 135 = -44.1 + 135 = 90.9 m\n\nSo the height of the ball after 3 seconds is 90.9 meters."
