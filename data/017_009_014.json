    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 9. Since the order of G is a prime power (9 = 3^2), G is a p-group. By the fact given, every non-identity element of G has order 3. We will now show that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nCase 1: G is abelian\nIf G is abelian, then G is a product of cyclic groups of prime order by the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups. Since the order of G is 9, G must be isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3. However, since every non-identity element of G has order 3, G cannot be isomorphic to C3 × C3 (as this group has elements of order 1, 3, and 9). Therefore, G must be isomorphic to C9.\n\nCase 2: G is non-abelian\nIf G is non-abelian, let a and b be two non-commuting elements of G, i.e., ab ≠ ba. Since the order of every non-identity element is 3, we have a^3 = b^3 = e, where e is the identity element of G. Now consider the element c = aba^(-1)b^(-1). We will show that c has order 3.\n\nFirst, note that c^(-1) = ab^(-1)a^(-1)b = a^(-1)ba^(-1)b^(-1) (since a and b do not commute). Now, let's compute c^3:\n\nc^3 = (aba^(-1)b^(-1))^3 = (aba^(-1)b^(-1))(aba^(-1)b^(-1))(aba^(-1)b^(-1))\n     = ab(a^(-1)b^(-1)ab)a^(-1)b^(-1) (since a^(-1)b^(-1)a = b^(-1)a^(-1)b)\n     = ab(b^(-1)a^(-1)ba)b^(-1)\n     = ab(b^(-1)a^(-1)ab)\n     = abe\n     = ab\n\nNow, since ab ≠ ba, we have c^3 ≠ e. However, we know that the order of every non-identity element in G is 3. Therefore, c must be equal to e. This implies that ab = ba, which is a contradiction since we assumed a and b do not commute.\n\nThus, if G is non-abelian, we reach a contradiction. Therefore, G must be abelian and isomorphic to C9. In conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9. However, we have shown that the non-abelian case leads to a contradiction, so G must be isomorphic to C9."
