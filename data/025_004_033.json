    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point where $t=2$, we first need to find the coordinates of the point and the slope of the tangent line at that point.\n\n1. Find the coordinates of the point where $t=2$:\n\n$x = \\frac{3t}{1+t} = \\frac{3(2)}{1+2} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2$\n\n$y = \\frac{2t^2}{1+t} = \\frac{2(2)^2}{1+2} = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\nSo the point is $(2, \\frac{8}{3})$.\n\n2. Find the slope of the tangent line at that point:\n\nTo find the slope, we need to find the derivatives of $x$ and $y$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\frac{3t}{1+t}\\right) = \\frac{3(1+t) - 3t}{(1+t)^2} = \\frac{3}{(1+t)^2}$\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\frac{2t^2}{1+t}\\right) = \\frac{2t(1+t) - 2t^2}{(1+t)^2} = \\frac{2t}{(1+t)^2}$\n\nNow we can find the slope of the tangent line by dividing $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ by $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{\\frac{dy}{dt}}{\\frac{dx}{dt}} = \\frac{\\frac{2t}{(1+t)^2}}{\\frac{3}{(1+t)^2}} = \\frac{2t}{3}$\n\nAt $t=2$, the slope of the tangent line is:\n\n$m = \\frac{2(2)}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$\n\n3. Find the equation of the tangent line:\n\nNow that we have the point $(2, \\frac{8}{3})$ and the slope $m = \\frac{4}{3}$, we can find the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form:\n\n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\n\n$y - \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}(x - 2)$\n\nTo get rid of the fractions, multiply both sides by 3:\n\n$3(y - \\frac{8}{3}) = 4(x - 2)$\n\n$3y - 8 = 4x - 8$\n\nNow, we can write the equation of the tangent line in the slope-intercept form:\n\n$3y = 4x$\n\nSo the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point where $t=2$ is:\n\n$\\boxed{3y = 4x}$"
