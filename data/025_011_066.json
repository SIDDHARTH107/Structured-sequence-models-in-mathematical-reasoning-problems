    "message_2": "1. To show that E is a smooth curve, we need to verify that its discriminant, Δ, is non-zero. The discriminant of an elliptic curve given by the equation y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B is defined as Δ = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2). In our case, A = 7 and B = 10.\n\nΔ = -16(4(7)^3 + 27(10)^2) = -16(1372 + 2700) = -16(4072)\n\nSince we are working over the field F7, we need to reduce the discriminant modulo 7:\n\nΔ = -16(4072) ≡ -16(2) ≡ 4 (mod 7)\n\nSince Δ ≠ 0 (mod 7), the elliptic curve E is smooth.\n\n2. To calculate the number of points on E over the finite field F7, we will use the following formula for the number of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field:\n\nN = q + 1 - a\n\nwhere N is the number of points on the curve, q is the size of the finite field (in our case, q = 7), and a is the trace of Frobenius. We can approximate a using the Hasse's theorem, which states that |a| ≤ 2√q. In our case, |a| ≤ 2√7 ≈ 5.32. Since a is an integer, the possible values for a are -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nNow we will test each possible value of a and count the number of points on E over F7:\n\nFor each x in F7, we will compute the right-hand side of the equation y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 and check if it is a quadratic residue (i.e., a square) in F7. If it is a quadratic residue, then there are two points on the curve with that x-coordinate (corresponding to the two square roots of the quadratic residue). If it is not a quadratic residue, then there are no points on the curve with that x-coordinate. We also need to include the point at infinity, which is always on the curve.\n\nHere are the calculations for each x in F7:\n\nx = 0: RHS = 0^3 + 7*0 + 10 ≡ 3 (mod 7) => not a quadratic residue => 0 points\nx = 1: RHS = 1^3 + 7*1 + 10 ≡ 4 (mod 7) => quadratic residue => 2 points\nx = 2: RHS = 2^3 + 7*2 + 10 ≡ 6 (mod 7) => not a quadratic residue => 0 points\nx = 3: RHS = 3^3 + 7*3 + 10 ≡ 2 (mod 7) => not a quadratic residue => 0 points\nx = 4: RHS = 4^3 + 7*4 + 10 ≡ 1 (mod 7) => quadratic residue => 2 points\nx = 5: RHS = 5^3 + 7*5 + 10 ≡ 5 (mod 7) => not a quadratic residue => 0 points\nx = 6: RHS = 6^3 + 7*6 + 10 ≡ 0 (mod 7) => quadratic residue => 2 points\n\nAdding the point at infinity, we have a total of 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 points on E over the finite field F7."
