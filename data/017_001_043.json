    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C4 or V4, we will analyze the properties of these two groups and compare them with the properties of G.\n\nC4 is the cyclic group of order 4, which means it has a single generator that can produce all the elements of the group. The elements of C4 are {1, a, a^2, a^3}, where a is the generator and a^4 = 1.\n\nV4, the Klein four-group, is a group of order 4 with the following elements: {1, a, b, c}, where a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1 and ab = c, bc = a, ac = b. V4 is not cyclic, as it does not have a single generator.\n\nTo determine which group G is isomorphic to, we will analyze the elements of G and their properties. Let G = {1, g1, g2, g3}.\n\n1. Check if G has an element of order 4:\nIf G has an element of order 4, say g1, then G = {1, g1, g1^2, g1^3}, and G is isomorphic to C4.\n\n2. Check if G has three elements of order 2:\nIf G does not have an element of order 4, we will check if it has three elements of order 2. If g1^2 = g2^2 = g3^2 = 1, then G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn summary, if G has an element of order 4, it is isomorphic to C4. If G has three elements of order 2, it is isomorphic to V4. Since G is a group of order 4, it must be isomorphic to either C4 or V4."
