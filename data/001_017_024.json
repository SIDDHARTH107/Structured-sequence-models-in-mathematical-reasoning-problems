    "message_2": "To solve the equation log2(4x+1) = 3, we need to rewrite the equation in exponential form. The equation in exponential form is:\n\n2^3 = 4x + 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2^3 = 8\n\n8 = 4x + 1\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n7 = 4x\n\nNow, divide by 4:\n\nx = 7/4\n\nSo, the solution is x = 7/4."
