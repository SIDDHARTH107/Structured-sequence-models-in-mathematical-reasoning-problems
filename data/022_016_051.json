    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose we have a simply connected region $D$ in the complex plane and we want to map it conformally onto the open unit disc $U=\\{z: |z|<1\\}$ using Riemann mapping theorem. Find the explicit formula for such a conformal map, given that $D$ is the half-plane $\\{z: \\mathrm{Re}(z)>0\\}$ and map three points $1+i$, $2$, and $3-2i$ to $0$, $1$, and $-1+i$, respectively.",
    "message_2": "To find the explicit formula for the conformal map, we will use the Schwarz-Christoffel formula. First, we need to map the half-plane $\\{z: \\mathrm{Re}(z)>0\\}$ to the upper half-plane $\\{z: \\mathrm{Im}(z)>0\\}$. We can do this by applying the transformation $w = z + i$. Now, the points $1+i$, $2$, and $3-2i$ are mapped to $2i$, $2+i$, and $1-2i$, respectively.\n\nNext, we will use the Schwarz-Christoffel formula to map the upper half-plane to the open unit disc $U$. The formula is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = A \\int_{z_0}^z \\frac{dz}{(z-a)^{\\alpha}(z-b)^{\\beta}(z-c)^{\\gamma}} + B$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants, $z_0$ is a reference point, and $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are angles associated with the vertices $a$, $b$, and $c$ of the polygon being mapped. In our case, the angles are $\\pi$, $\\pi$, and $0$, respectively, since we are mapping the upper half-plane to the open unit disc.\n\nNow, we need to find the constants $A$ and $B$. We can do this by using the fact that the points $2i$, $2+i$, and $1-2i$ are mapped to $0$, $1$, and $-1+i$, respectively. Plugging these points into the formula, we get:\n\n$$0 = A \\int_{2i}^{2i} \\frac{dz}{(z-(2i))^{\\pi}(z-(2+i))^{\\pi}(z-(1-2i))^0} + B$$\n$$1 = A \\int_{2i}^{2+i} \\frac{dz}{(z-(2i))^{\\pi}(z-(2+i))^{\\pi}(z-(1-2i))^0} + B$$\n$$-1+i = A \\int_{2i}^{1-2i} \\frac{dz}{(z-(2i))^{\\pi}(z-(2+i))^{\\pi}(z-(1-2i))^0} + B$$\n\nSolving these equations, we find that $A = \\frac{1}{\\pi}$ and $B = 0$. Thus, the conformal map is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{2i}^z \\frac{dz}{(z-(2i))^{\\pi}(z-(2+i))^{\\pi}(z-(1-2i))^0}$$\n\nFinally, we need to apply the inverse transformation $w = z - i$ to map the upper half-plane back to the half-plane $\\{z: \\mathrm{Re}(z)>0\\}$. The explicit formula for the conformal map is then:\n\n$$F(z) = f(z+i) - i = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{2i}^{z+i} \\frac{dz}{(z-(2i))^{\\pi}(z-(2+i))^{\\pi}(z-(1-2i))^0} - i$$"
