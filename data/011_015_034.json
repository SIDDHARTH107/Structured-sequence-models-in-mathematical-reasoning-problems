Find the minimum number of friend pairings (not including a person's friendship with themselves) that must exist to ensure that there are at least 3 people, all of whom are friends with each other OR at least 3 people, none of whom are friends with each other.",
    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. We will consider one person, say person A, and look at their relationships with the other 5 people in the party. There are two possibilities for each relationship: either they are friends or strangers.\n\nCase 1: Person A has at least 3 friends.\nIf person A has at least 3 friends, then among these 3 friends, there must be at least one pair who are either friends or strangers with each other. If they are friends, then we have a group of 3 people who are all friends (person A and the two friends). If they are strangers, then we have a group of 3 people who are not friends with each other (person A and the two strangers).\n\nCase 2: Person A has at least 3 strangers.\nIf person A has at least 3 strangers, then among these 3 strangers, there must be at least one pair who are either friends or strangers with each other. If they are friends, then we have a group of 3 people who are all friends (the two friends and the third stranger). If they are strangers, then we have a group of 3 people who are not friends with each other (the three strangers).\n\nIn either case, we are guaranteed to have at least one group of 3 people who are all friends or all strangers. Therefore, the minimum number of friend pairings that must exist to ensure this condition is met is 3."
