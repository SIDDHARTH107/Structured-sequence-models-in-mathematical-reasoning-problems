    "message_1": "Consider a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $3$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, given by the following equation:\n\n$$y^2z = x^3 - xz^2$$\n\nLet $X$ be the projective plane curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2(k)$ defined by the equation: \n\n$$X = V(y^2z - x^3 + xz^2)\\subset \\mathbb{P}^2(k)$$\n\nDetermine the dimension of the vector space $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C)$, where $\\mathcal{O}_C$ is the sheaf of regular functions on $C$ and $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C)$ denotes the first cohomology group of $C$ with coefficients in $\\mathcal{O}_C$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C)$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor $D$ on a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$$\\dim H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) - \\dim H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$$\n\nIn our case, we want to compute the dimension of $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C)$, which corresponds to the case when $D = 0$. Thus, the Riemann-Roch theorem gives us:\n\n$$\\dim H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C) - \\dim H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C) = \\deg(0) + 1 - g$$\n\nSince the degree of the zero divisor is 0 and the genus of our curve is 3, we have:\n\n$$\\dim H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C) - \\dim H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C) = 1 - 3$$\n\nNow, we need to compute $\\dim H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C)$. Recall that $H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C)$ is the space of global regular functions on $C$. Since $C$ is a projective curve, the only global regular functions on $C$ are constants. Therefore, $\\dim H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C) = 1$.\n\nSubstituting this into our equation, we get:\n\n$$1 - \\dim H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C) = -2$$\n\nSolving for $\\dim H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C)$, we find that:\n\n$$\\dim H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C) = 3$$\n\nThus, the dimension of the vector space $H^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C)$ is 3."
