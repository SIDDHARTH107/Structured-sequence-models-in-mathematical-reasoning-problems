    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression √(18x^4y^6), we will first break down the expression into its prime factors and then use the properties of square roots to simplify.\n\n18x^4y^6 = 2 * 9 * x^4 * y^6 = 2 * 3^2 * x^4 * y^6\n\nNow, we can use the property of square roots that states √(a * b) = √a * √b.\n\n√(18x^4y^6) = √(2 * 3^2 * x^4 * y^6) = √(2) * √(3^2) * √(x^4) * √(y^6)\n\nSince the square root of a perfect square is the base number, we can simplify the expression further:\n\n√(18x^4y^6) = √(2) * 3 * x^2 * y^3\n\nSo, the simplified form of the radical expression is:\n\n3x^2y^3√2"
