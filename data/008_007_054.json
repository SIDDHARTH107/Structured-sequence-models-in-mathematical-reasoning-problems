    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and an invertible matrix P such that P^(-1)AP = D, we need to diagonalize the matrix A. This involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.\n\nFirst, let's find the eigenvalues of A. We need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [3-λ 7; 5 2-λ]\n\ndet(A - λI) = (3-λ)(2-λ) - (7)(5) = λ^2 - 5λ - 26\n\nThe characteristic equation is λ^2 - 5λ - 26 = 0. Solving for λ, we get:\n\n(λ - 8)(λ + 3) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 8 and λ2 = -3.\n\nNow, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 8:\n\n(A - 8I)v1 = 0\n[-5 7; 5 -6]v1 = 0\n\nRow reducing the augmented matrix, we get:\n\n[-5 7 | 0]\n[ 0 0 | 0]\n\nv1 = t[7, 5] for any scalar t. We can choose t = 1, so v1 = [7, 5].\n\nFor λ2 = -3:\n\n(A + 3I)v2 = 0\n[6 7; 5 5]v2 = 0\n\nRow reducing the augmented matrix, we get:\n\n[1 1 | 0]\n[0 0 | 0]\n\nv2 = t[-1, 1] for any scalar t. We can choose t = 1, so v2 = [-1, 1].\n\nNow, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns:\n\nP = [7 -1; 5 1]\n\nTo find P^(-1), we can use the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix:\n\nP^(-1) = (1/det(P)) * [d -b; -c a], where a, b, c, and d are elements of the matrix P.\n\ndet(P) = (7)(1) - (-1)(5) = 7 + 5 = 12\n\nP^(-1) = (1/12) * [1 -1; -5 7] = [1/12 -1/12; -5/12 7/12]\n\nNow, we can find the diagonal matrix D:\n\nD = P^(-1)AP\n\nD = [1/12 -1/12; -5/12 7/12] * [3 7; 5 2] * [7 -1; 5 1]\n\nD = [8 0; 0 -3]\n\nSo, the diagonal matrix D is:\n\nD = [8 0; 0 -3]\n\nAnd the invertible matrix P is:\n\nP = [7 -1; 5 1]"
