    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of length 8 meters and 11 meters. The included angle between these two sides is 57 degrees. What is the perimeter of the triangle, in meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two known sides, C is the included angle between them, and c is the length of the unknown side.\n\nIn this case, a = 8 meters, b = 11 meters, and C = 57 degrees.\n\nc² = 8² + 11² - 2 * 8 * 11 * cos(57)\nc² = 64 + 121 - 176 * cos(57)\nc² ≈ 185 - 176 * 0.5403\nc² ≈ 95.91\n\nNow, take the square root to find the length of the third side:\n\nc ≈ √95.91\nc ≈ 9.79 meters\n\nNow that we have the length of the third side, we can find the perimeter by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = 8 + 11 + 9.79 ≈ 28.79 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is approximately 28.79 meters."
