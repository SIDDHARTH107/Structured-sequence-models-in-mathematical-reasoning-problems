    "message_2": "To find the degree of the curve C, we first need to eliminate the parameter t and obtain a homogeneous polynomial equation in the projective coordinates [x:y:z]. \n\nWe have the parametrization C(t) = [t^2 - 1 : 2t : t^2 + 1]. Let's set x = t^2 - 1, y = 2t, and z = t^2 + 1.\n\nFrom y = 2t, we can solve for t: t = y/2.\n\nNow, substitute this expression for t into the other two equations:\n\nx = (y/2)^2 - 1\nz = (y/2)^2 + 1\n\nSimplify these equations:\n\nx = y^2/4 - 1\nz = y^2/4 + 1\n\nNow, let's eliminate the fractions by multiplying both equations by 4:\n\n4x = y^2 - 4\n4z = y^2 + 4\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n4z - 4x = 8\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nz - x = 2\n\nSo, we have the homogeneous polynomial equation:\n\nx - z + 2 = 0\n\nThe degree of this equation is 1, so the degree of the curve C is 1."
