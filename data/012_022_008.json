    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices contains either a complete subgraph with m vertices or an independent set with n vertices. In the case of a complete graph on 6 vertices, we are looking for the Ramsey number R(6, 6).\n\nThe exact value of R(6, 6) is not known. However, it is known that R(6, 6) lies between 102 and 165, inclusive. This means that in any graph with at least 102 vertices, there must be either a complete subgraph with 6 vertices or an independent set with 6 vertices."
