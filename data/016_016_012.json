    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that can be constructed using a recursive process. The perimeter of the Gosper curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (number of segments) * (length of each segment)\n\nThe number of segments in the Gosper curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of segments = 6 * (7^n - 1) / (7 - 1)\n\nFor the Gosper curve of order 5, we can calculate the number of segments as follows:\n\nNumber of segments = 6 * (7^5 - 1) / (7 - 1)\nNumber of segments = 6 * (16807 - 1) / 6\nNumber of segments = 6 * 16806 / 6\nNumber of segments = 16806\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the Gosper curve of order 5 with each segment having a length of 1 unit:\n\nPerimeter = (number of segments) * (length of each segment)\nPerimeter = 16806 * 1\nPerimeter = 16806 units"
