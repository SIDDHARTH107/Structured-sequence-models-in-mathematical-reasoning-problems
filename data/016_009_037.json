    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal pattern that can be created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it to form a series of right angles. The total length of the Dragon curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal length = (number of line segments) * (length of each line segment)\n\nAfter each iteration, the number of line segments doubles. So, after the 5th iteration, the number of line segments will be:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^5 = 32\n\nAssuming each line segment has a length of 1 unit, the total length of the Dragon curve after the 5th iteration will be:\n\nTotal length = 32 * 1 = 32 units"
