    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid, also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal structure created by repeatedly removing smaller tetrahedra from the original tetrahedron. Each level of the pyramid consists of 4^(n-1) smaller tetrahedra, where n is the level number.\n\nTo find the total number of triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid with 6 levels, we need to calculate the number of triangular faces in each level and then sum them up.\n\nLevel 1: 1 tetrahedron with 4 triangular faces\nLevel 2: 4 tetrahedra with 4 * 4 = 16 triangular faces\nLevel 3: 16 tetrahedra with 16 * 4 = 64 triangular faces\nLevel 4: 64 tetrahedra with 64 * 4 = 256 triangular faces\nLevel 5: 256 tetrahedra with 256 * 4 = 1024 triangular faces\nLevel 6: 1024 tetrahedra with 1024 * 4 = 4096 triangular faces\n\nNow, we sum up the triangular faces from all levels:\n\n4 + 16 + 64 + 256 + 1024 + 4096 = 5460\n\nSo, there are a total of 5460 triangular faces in a Sierpinski pyramid with 6 levels."
