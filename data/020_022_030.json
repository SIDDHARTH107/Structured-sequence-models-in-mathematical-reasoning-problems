The company has 500 units of raw material and can produce a maximum of 200 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B per day. \n\nThe company makes a profit of $10 on each unit of Product A and $15 on each unit of Product B. \n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit earned by the company using optimal resource allocation. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B to produce per day to maximize the profit of the company?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe company has 500 units of raw material, so the constraint for the raw material is:\nx + y ≤ 500\n\nThe company can produce a maximum of 200 units of Product A per day, so the constraint for Product A is:\nx ≤ 200\n\nThe company can produce a maximum of 150 units of Product B per day, so the constraint for Product B is:\ny ≤ 150\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nWe will use the method of solving linear programming problems by finding the vertices of the feasible region and evaluating the profit function at each vertex.\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the following inequalities:\nx + y ≤ 500\nx ≤ 200\ny ≤ 150\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are the points where the lines intersect. We have the following vertices:\n(0, 0), (0, 150), (200, 0), (200, 150), and (350, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(0, 150) = 10(0) + 15(150) = $2,250\nP(200, 0) = 10(200) + 15(0) = $2,000\nP(200, 150) = 10(200) + 15(150) = $4,250\nP(350, 0) = 10(350) + 15(0) = $3,500\n\nThe maximum profit is $4,250, which occurs when the company produces 200 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B per day."
