    "message_1": "On a certain stretch of a highway, the probability of a car accident occurring on any given day is 0.05. What is the probability of no car accidents occurring on that stretch of the highway for 4 consecutive days?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of no car accidents occurring for 4 consecutive days, we need to find the probability of no accident occurring on each day and then multiply those probabilities together.\n\nThe probability of no accident occurring on a single day is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the probability of no accident occurring on each of the 4 days:\n\n0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8145 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nSo, the probability of no car accidents occurring on that stretch of the highway for 4 consecutive days is approximately 0.8145 or 81.45%."
