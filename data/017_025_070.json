    "message_2": "Given the information, there are three types of groups of order 120:\n\n1. The cyclic group C120\n2. The alternating group A5 × C2 × C2\n3. One of the 487 non-abelian groups of order 120\n\nSince each of these groups is non-isomorphic to the others, we can simply count the number of groups in each category to find the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120.\n\n1. There is only one cyclic group of order 120, C120.\n2. There is only one alternating group of the given form, A5 × C2 × C2.\n3. There are 487 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nAdding these together, we find that there are 1 + 1 + 487 = 489 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
