    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors. The dot product formula is:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nWhere A · B is the dot product of the two vectors, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the two vectors:\n\nA · B = (3 * -2) + (7 * 9) = -6 + 63 = 57\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n|A| = √(3² + 7²) = √(9 + 49) = √58\n|B| = √((-2)² + 9²) = √(4 + 81) = √85\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula:\n\n57 = (√58)(√85) cos(θ)\n\nTo find the cosine of the angle, we can divide both sides by the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = 57 / (√58 * √85)\n\nNow, we can use the inverse cosine function (arccos) to find the angle:\n\nθ = arccos(57 / (√58 * √85))\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 radians\n\nTo convert this to degrees, we can use the following formula:\n\nθ (in degrees) = θ (in radians) * (180 / π)\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 * (180 / π) ≈ 52.7°\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors is approximately 52.7 degrees."
