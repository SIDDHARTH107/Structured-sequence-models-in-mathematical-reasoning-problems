    "message_2": "In the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction system, the maximum number of possible periodic orbits for a given set of reaction parameters can be determined using the concept of period-doubling bifurcation.\n\nAssuming that the system has a period-3 orbit, with the unstable manifold of the period-1 sink intersecting the period-2 orbit, which is inside the period-3 orbit, we can analyze the bifurcation structure.\n\nStarting with the period-1 sink, the unstable manifold intersects the period-2 orbit, which implies that there is a period-doubling bifurcation. This bifurcation leads to the creation of a period-2 orbit. Similarly, the period-2 orbit is inside the period-3 orbit, which implies another period-doubling bifurcation, leading to the creation of a period-4 orbit.\n\nIn general, the maximum number of possible periodic orbits in a system can be determined by the number of period-doubling bifurcations. In this case, there are two period-doubling bifurcations, which lead to the creation of period-2 and period-4 orbits.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of possible periodic orbits in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction system for the given set of reaction parameters is 4, including the period-1 sink, period-2 orbit, period-3 orbit, and period-4 orbit."
