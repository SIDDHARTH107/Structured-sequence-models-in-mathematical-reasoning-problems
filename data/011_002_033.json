    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to select 4 balls out of 10 without considering the order, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of balls (10 in this case) and k is the number of balls to be selected (4 in this case).\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 4) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 4) = 5040 / 24\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 ways to select 4 balls out of 10 without considering the order."
