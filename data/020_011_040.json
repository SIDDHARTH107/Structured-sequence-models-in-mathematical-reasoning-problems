    "message_1": "A company wants to produce two types of products A and B, using two machines M1 and M2. Product A requires 3 hours of machine M1 and 2 hours of machine M2 to be produced. Product B requires 2 hours of machine M1 and 3 hours of machine M2 to be produced. The company has 120 hours of machine M1 per week and 180 hours of machine M2 per week available for production. The profit per unit of product A is 10 dollars, and the profit per of product B is 12 dollars. \n\nWhat is the optimal production plan to maximize the company's profit while satisfying the production and machine capacity constraints?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the machines' available hours are:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 120 (M1 constraint)\n2x + 3y ≤ 180 (M2 constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 12y\n\nTo find the optimal production plan, we need to solve this linear programming problem. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints.\n\nThe M1 constraint (3x + 2y ≤ 120) can be rewritten as y ≤ (120 - 3x)/2.\nThe M2 constraint (2x + 3y ≤ 180) can be rewritten as y ≤ (180 - 2x)/3.\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these two inequalities. To find the vertices of the feasible region, we'll solve the two equations for the boundary lines:\n\ny = (120 - 3x)/2\ny = (180 - 2x)/3\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously:\n\n(120 - 3x)/2 = (180 - 2x)/3\n360 - 9x = 360 - 6x\n3x = 6x - 360\nx = 60\n\nSubstituting x = 60 into either equation to find y:\n\ny = (180 - 2*60)/3\ny = (180 - 120)/3\ny = 60/3\ny = 20\n\nSo, the optimal production plan is to produce 60 units of product A and 20 units of product B.\n\nTo find the maximum profit, substitute these values into the profit function:\n\nP = 10x + 12y\nP = 10(60) + 12(20)\nP = 600 + 240\nP = 840\n\nThe maximum profit the company can achieve with this production plan is 840 dollars per week."
