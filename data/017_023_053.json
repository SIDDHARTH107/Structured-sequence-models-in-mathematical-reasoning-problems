    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 72, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 72: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n2. Determine the possible divisors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n3. Use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups for each prime divisor.\n\nFor the prime divisor 2 (p = 2):\n- The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9, so n_2 can be 1, 3, or 9.\n- Additionally, n_2 must be congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can only be 1 or 9.\n\nFor the prime divisor 3 (p = 3):\n- The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^3 = 8, so n_3 can be 1, 2, 4, or 8.\n- Additionally, n_3 must be congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can only be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, there is only one group, the cyclic group of order 72 (Z_72).\n2. If n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1, there are two non-isomorphic groups: the direct product of Z_8 and Z_9 (Z_8 × Z_9) and the semidirect product of Z_8 and Z_9 (Z_8 ⋊ Z_9).\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, there is only one non-isomorphic group: the direct product of Z_4 and Z_18 (Z_4 × Z_18).\n4. If n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4, there are four non-isomorphic groups: the direct product of Z_4 and Z_2 × Z_36 (Z_4 × (Z_2 × Z_36)), the direct product of Z_4 and Z_4 × Z_18 (Z_4 × (Z_4 × Z_18)), the semidirect product of Z_4 and Z_2 × Z_36 (Z_4 ⋊ (Z_2 × Z_36)), and the semidirect product of Z_4 and Z_4 × Z_18 (Z_4 ⋊ (Z_4 × Z_18)).\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 72."
