    "message_2": "To find the length of one side of an equilateral triangle given its area, we can use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:\n\nArea = (sqrt(3)/4) * side^2\n\nIn this case, the area is 27 square units. We can set up the equation:\n\n27 = (sqrt(3)/4) * side^2\n\nNow, we need to solve for the side length. First, multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n108 = sqrt(3) * side^2\n\nNext, divide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n108/sqrt(3) = side^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nside = sqrt(108/sqrt(3))\n\nTo simplify the expression, multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction inside the square root by sqrt(3):\n\nside = sqrt((108*sqrt(3))/(3))\n\nNow, simplify the fraction:\n\nside = sqrt(36*sqrt(3))\n\nFinally, take the square root of 36:\n\nside = 6*sqrt(3)\n\nSo, the length of one side of the equilateral triangle is 6*sqrt(3) units."
