    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 18. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (subgroups of order 3) in G must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. In this case, the possible number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 18 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. Among these, only 1 and 3 are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nTherefore, there are either 1 or 3 subgroups of order 3 in a group of order 18."
