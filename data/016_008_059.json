    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not change with the number of iterations. It remains constant and can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(M)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and M is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each line segment is divided into 4 segments of equal length, so N = 4. The scaling factor M is 3, as each new segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the 5th iteration, or any iteration, is approximately 1.2619."
