They surveyed 20 college students and obtained the following data:\n\nAge (years): 19, 20, 21, 22, 18, 19, 20, 23, 21, 18, 20, 22, 19, 20, 21, 23, 18, 19, 20, 22\nGPA: 3.0, 3.5, 3.3, 3.6, 2.8, 3.2, 3.1, 3.9, 3.4, 2.7, 3.0, 3.5, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, 3.8, 2.5, 3.0, 3.2, 3.5\n\nCalculate the correlation coefficient between age and GPA.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) between age and GPA, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of both age and GPA.\n2. Calculate the difference between each value and its mean.\n3. Multiply the differences for each pair of values.\n4. Square the differences for both age and GPA.\n5. Sum the products from step 3 and the squared differences from step 4.\n6. Divide the sum of products by the square root of the product of the sums of squared differences.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Mean of age: (19+20+21+22+18+19+20+23+21+18+20+22+19+20+21+23+18+19+20+22)/20 = 20.1\n   Mean of GPA: (3.0+3.5+3.3+3.6+2.8+3.2+3.1+3.9+3.4+2.7+3.0+3.5+3.2+3.3+3.6+3.8+2.5+3.0+3.2+3.5)/20 = 3.29\n\n2.
