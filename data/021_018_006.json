    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic algorithm used for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It uses a local search procedure with a memory structure called the tabu list to avoid cycling and explore the solution space more effectively. However, applying tabu search to a continuous optimization problem like this one is not straightforward, as it is designed for discrete problems.\n\nInstead, let's solve the problem using calculus, which is more appropriate for this continuous optimization problem.\n\nThe given function is f(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 7, and we want to minimize it subject to the constraint 0 ≤ x ≤ 5.\n\nFirst, find the first derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 - 8x + 7) / dx = 4x - 8\n\nNow, set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n4x - 8 = 0\n4x = 8\nx = 2\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the constraint interval to make sure we have found the minimum value of f(x):\n\nf(0) = 2(0)^2 - 8(0) + 7 = 7\nf(2) = 2(2)^2 - 8(2) + 7 = -1\nf(5) = 2(5)^2 - 8(5) + 7 = 27\n\nThe minimum value of f(x) occurs at x = 2, and the minimum value is f(2) = -1. So, the optimal value of f(x) is -1, and the value of x that minimizes the function is x = 2."
