    "message_2": "To find the volume of the metal ball, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nGiven the diameter of the metal ball is 14 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter:\n\nr = 14 cm / 2 = 7 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the radius into the formula to find the volume:\n\nV = (4/3)π(7 cm)^3\nV = (4/3)π(343 cm^3)\nV ≈ (4/3) * 3.14159 * 343 cm^3\nV ≈ 1.33333 * 3.14159 * 343 cm^3\nV ≈ 4.18879 * 343 cm^3\nV ≈ 1436.755 cm^3\n\nThe volume of the metal used to make the ball is approximately 1436.755 cubic centimeters."
