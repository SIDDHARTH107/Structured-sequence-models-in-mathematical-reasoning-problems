    "message_2": "The statement is true.\n\nProof:\nLet a be an even integer and b be an odd integer.\nBy definition, we can write a = 2m and b = 2n + 1, where m and n are integers.\n\nNow, let's compute the product ab:\nab = (2m)(2n + 1) = 4mn + 2m = 2(2mn + m)\n\nSince 2mn + m is an integer (let's call it k), we can write ab = 2k, where k is an integer.\n\nThus, ab is an even integer, and the statement is true."
