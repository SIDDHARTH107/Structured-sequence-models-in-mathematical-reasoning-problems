Each warehouse can only hold a maximum of 250 units of products. The table below shows the minimum and maximum number of units that can be transported from each warehouse to each retail store.\n\n|  | Retail Store 1 | Retail Store 2 | Retail Store 3 | Retail Store 4 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Warehouse 1 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 |\n| Warehouse 2 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 |\n| Warehouse 3 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 |\n\nDetermine whether it is possible for the company to transport all the required units of Product A and Product B within the given constraints. If it is possible, find one possible solution for the transportation plan.",
    "message_2": "First, let's check if the total capacity of the warehouses is enough to hold all the required units of Product A and Product B.\n\nTotal capacity of warehouses = 250 * 3 = 750 units\nTotal units of Product A and Product B = 240 + 300 = 540 units\n\nSince 540 units is less than the total capacity of the warehouses (750 units), it is possible to transport all the required units of Product A and Product B within the given constraints.\n\nNow, let's find one possible solution for the transportation plan. We can start by distributing the units of Product A and Product B to the warehouses.\n\nWarehouse 1: 240 units (all Product A)\nWarehouse 2: 250 units (10 units of Product A and 240 units of Product B)\nWarehouse 3: 50 units (all Product B)\n\nNow, we can distribute these units to the retail stores, making sure we stay within the minimum and maximum transportation limits.\n\n|  | Retail Store 1 | Retail Store 2 | Retail Store 3 | Retail Store 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Warehouse 1 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 150 | 240 |\n| Warehouse 2 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 70 | 250 |\n| Warehouse 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 50 | 50 |\n\nThis transportation plan meets the minimum and maximum transportation limits and successfully transports all the required units of Product A and Product B to the retail stores."
