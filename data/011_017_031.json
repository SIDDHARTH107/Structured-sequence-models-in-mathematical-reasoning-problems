    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. For a 3x3 Latin square with the numbers 1-3, we can calculate the number of possible squares as follows:\n\n1. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange the numbers in the first row, which is 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n2. For the second row, there are 2 possible ways to arrange the numbers, since the first number in the second row must be different from the first number in the first row, and the second number in the second row must be different from the second number in the first row.\n3. For the third row, there is only 1 possible way to arrange the numbers, as the numbers must be different from the numbers in the same column of the first and second rows.\n\nSo, the total number of possible 3x3 Latin squares with the numbers 1-3 is 6 × 2 × 1 = 12."
