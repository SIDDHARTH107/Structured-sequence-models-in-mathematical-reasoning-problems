    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a regular tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of small tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4. \n\nTo find the total number of small tetrahedra created in the 7th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of small tetrahedra = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the 7th iteration:\n\nTotal number of small tetrahedra = 4^7 = 16,384\n\nSo, in the 7th iteration of the Sierpinski tetrahedron construction, there are 16,384 small tetrahedra."
