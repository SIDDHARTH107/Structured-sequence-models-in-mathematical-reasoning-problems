    "message_1": "In a signaling game, consider a sender who has two messages to choose from, A and B. The receiver must make a decision based on the message they receive. If the sender selects message A, the receiver has a 70% chance of correctly guessing the sender's intended outcome. If the sender selects message B, the receiver has a 60% chance of correctly guessing the sender's intended outcome. If the payoff for the sender is 3 for a correct guess and 0 for an incorrect guess, what is the sender's expected payoff if they select message A? What is the sender's expected payoff if they select message B?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected payoff for the sender, we need to multiply the probability of the receiver guessing correctly by the payoff for a correct guess, and add that to the probability of the receiver guessing incorrectly multiplied by the payoff for an incorrect guess.\n\nFor message A:\nExpected payoff = (Probability of correct guess * Payoff for correct guess) + (Probability of incorrect guess * Payoff for incorrect guess)\nExpected payoff = (0.7 * 3) + (0.3 * 0)\nExpected payoff = 2.1 + 0\nExpected payoff = 2.1\n\nFor message B:\nExpected payoff = (Probability of correct guess * Payoff for correct guess) + (Probability of incorrect guess * Payoff for incorrect guess)\nExpected payoff = (0.6 * 3) + (0.4 * 0)\nExpected payoff = 1.8 + 0\nExpected payoff = 1.8\n\nSo, the sender's expected payoff if they select message A is 2.1, and the sender's expected payoff if they select message B is 1.8."
