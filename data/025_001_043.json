    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic curves is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicity and including complex and points at infinity, provided that the curves have no common components.\n\nThe given curves are:\n\nC1: x^2 + y^2 - 4 = 0 (degree 2)\nC2: x - 3y + 2 = 0 (degree 1)\n\nSince the two curves have no common components, we can apply Bezout's theorem:\n\nNumber of intersection points = degree(C1) * degree(C2) = 2 * 1 = 2\n\nSo, there are 2 intersection points of these two curves, counted with multiplicity and including complex and points at infinity."
