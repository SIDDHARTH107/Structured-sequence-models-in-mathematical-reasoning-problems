Determine the number of possible groups for each prime factor using the formula: n_p = (p^(k+1) - 1)/(p - 1), where p is the prime factor and k is its exponent.\n   - For 2: n_2 = (2^(3+1) - 1)/(2 - 1) = 15\n   - For 3: n_3 = (3^(1+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) = 4\n   - For 5: n_5 = (5^(1+1) - 1)/(5 - 1) = 6\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n: n = (n_p1 * n_p2 * ... * n_pk) / (p1 * p2 * ... * pk), where n_pi is the number of possible groups for each prime factor and pi is the prime factor.\n   - n = (15 * 4 * 6) / (2 * 3 * 5) = 360 / 30 = 12\n\nThere are 12 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
