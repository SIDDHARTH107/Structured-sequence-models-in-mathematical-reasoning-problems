    "message_1": "Suppose an investor hires a manager to run their portfolio. The manager has two investment strategies to choose from: a safe strategy that yields a 5% return and a risky strategy that yields either 10% or -10% with equal probability. The investor's utility function is given by U(W) = sqrt(W), where W is the investor's wealth. The manager receives a fee of 10% of any return earned. \n\nAssume that the investor has $1,000,000 to invest and that the manager has a reservation utility of $30,000. What investment strategy should the manager choose to maximize their expected utility? And what is the expected utility of the investor given the manager's choice?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the expected return and the manager's fee for each strategy.\n\nSafe strategy:\nReturn: 5% * $1,000,000 = $50,000\nManager's fee: 10% * $50,000 = $5,000\nInvestor's return: $50,000 - $5,000 = $45,000\nInvestor's new wealth: $1,000,000 + $45,000 = $1,045,000\n\nRisky strategy:\nReturn: (10% * $1,000,000 + (-10%) * $1,000,000) / 2 = $0\nManager's fee: 10% * $0 = $0\nInvestor's return: $0 - $0 = $0\nInvestor's new wealth: $1,000,000 + $0 = $1,000,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the investor's utility for each strategy.\n\nSafe strategy:\nU(W) = sqrt($1,045,000) ≈ 1022.49\n\nRisky strategy:\nU(W) = (sqrt($1,100,000) + sqrt($900,000)) / 2 ≈ (1048.81 + 948.68) / 2 ≈ 998.75\n\nSince the investor's utility is higher with the safe strategy (1022.49 > 998.75), the manager should choose the safe strategy to maximize the investor's expected utility.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected utility of the investor given the manager's choice of the safe strategy.\n\nExpected utility = U(W) = sqrt($1,045,000) ≈ 1022.49"
