    "message_2": "To calculate the price of the European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to first find the values of d1 and d2, and then use these values to find the call option price.\n\nThe Black-Scholes formula for a call option is given by:\n\nCall price = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nS = current price of the underlying asset ($100)\nX = strike price of the option ($110)\nr = drift rate (5% per annum, or 0.05)\nT = time to maturity (6 months, or 0.5 years)\nσ = volatility (20% per annum, or 0.20)\nN(x) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + σ^2/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.05 + 0.20^2/2) * 0.5) / (0.20 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 = (-0.0953 + (0.05 + 0.02) * 0.5) / (0.20 * 0.7071)\nd1 = (-0.0953 + 0.035) / 0.1414\nd1 = -0.4265\n\nd2 = -0.4265 - 0.20 * sqrt(0.5)\nd2 = -0.4265 - 0.1414\nd2 = -0.5679\n\nNow we can calculate the call option price:\n\nCall price = 100 * N(-0.4265) - 110 * e^(-0.05 * 0.5) * N(-0.5679)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\nN(-0.4265) = 0.3349\nN(-0.5679) = 0.2852\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCall price = 100 * 0.3349 - 110 * e^(-0.025) * 0.2852\nCall price = 33.49 - 110 * 0.97531 * 0.2852\nCall price = 33.49 - 110 * 0.2779\nCall price = 33.49 - 30.57\n\nCall price = $2.92\n\nSo, the price of the European call option with a strike price of $110 and a maturity of 6 months, given the underlying asset's current price of $100, drift rate of 5% per annum, and volatility of 20% per annum, is approximately $2.92."
