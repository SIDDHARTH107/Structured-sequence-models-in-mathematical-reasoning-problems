    "message_2": "There are three distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 8. We will show that each of these classes corresponds to one of the three groups: the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4.\n\n1. The cyclic group C8: This group has order 8 and is generated by a single element, say a, with the property that a^8 = e (the identity element). The elements of C8 are {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7}. Since there is only one cyclic group of order 8, it forms its own isomorphism class.\n\n2. The quaternion group Q8: This group has order 8 and is generated by two elements, say i and j, with the properties that i^4 = j^4 = e, i^2 = j^2, and ij = -ji. The elements of Q8 are {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}, where k = ij. The quaternion group is non-abelian and is not isomorphic to C8, as C8 is abelian. Thus, Q8 forms a distinct isomorphism class.\n\n3. The dihedral group D4: This group has order 8 and is generated by two elements, say r and s, with the properties that r^4 = s^2 = e and sr = r^(-1)s. The elements of D4 are {e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}. The dihedral group is non-abelian and is not isomorphic to C8 or Q8. To see this, note that D4 has four elements of order 2 (namely s, sr, sr^2, and sr^3), while Q8 has only one element of order 2 (namely -1). Thus, D4 forms a distinct isomorphism class.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three distinct isomorphism classes of groups of order 8, corresponding to the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, and the dihedral group D4."
