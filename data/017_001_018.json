    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, we will consider the possible orders of elements in G.\n\nFirst, note that the identity element e of G has order 1. Since G has order 4, there are three remaining elements in G. Let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: There exists an element of order 4 in G.\nLet g be an element of G with order 4. Then, the subgroup generated by g, denoted as <g>, contains the elements {e, g, g^2, g^3}. Since <g> has 4 elements and G has 4 elements, we have G = <g>. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 4, which means G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: There is no element of order 4 in G.\nIn this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 2. Let a and b be two distinct non-identity elements in G. Then, we have a^2 = e and b^2 = e. Since G has 4 elements and we already have e, a, and b, the last element must be the product of a and b, denoted as c = ab. Note that c cannot be equal to e, a, or b, otherwise, G would have less than 4 elements.\n\nNow, we will show that c also has order 2. We have:\n\n(c^2) = (ab)^2 = abab.\n\nSince a and b have order 2, we know that a^2 = e and b^2 = e. We can rewrite the above equation as:\n\nabab = a(e)b = a(ab)^2 = a^3b = (a^2)a(b^2)b = eab = ab.\n\nThus, c^2 = abab = ab = c, which implies that c has order 2.\n\nNow, we have shown that all non-identity elements of G have order 2. Moreover, we have:\n\nG = {e, a, b, c},\n\nwith the properties:\n\n1. e is the identity element.\n2. a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e.\n3. c = ab.\n\nThese properties uniquely define the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that G must be isomorphic to either C4 or V4, depending on whether or not there exists an element of order 4 in G."
