    "message_1": "A trapezium has two parallel sides of length 6 cm and 10 cm respectively. The distance between these parallel sides is 8 cm. Find the perimeter of this trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two non-parallel sides. Let's call these sides a and b.\n\nWe can form two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one vertex of the shorter parallel side (6 cm) to the longer parallel side (10 cm). Let's call the length of this perpendicular line h.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles, one with legs of length h and a, and the other with legs of length h and b. The sum of the bases of these two triangles is equal to the difference between the lengths of the parallel sides, which is 10 cm - 6 cm = 4 cm.\n\nSince the distance between the parallel sides is 8 cm, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of a and b.\n\nFor the first right triangle:\na^2 + 8^2 = h^2\na^2 + 64 = h^2\n\nFor the second right triangle:\nb^2 + 8^2 = h^2\nb^2 + 64 = h^2\n\nSince a + b = 4, we can square both sides of this equation to get:\n(a + b)^2 = 4^2\na^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 16\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for h^2 from the Pythagorean theorem equations into this equation:\n(64 + 2ab + 64) = 16\n128 + 2ab = 16\n\nSolving for ab, we get:\n2ab = -112\nab = -56\n\nSince the product of a and b is negative, one of the sides must be negative, which is not possible for the sides of a trapezium. Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement, and it is not possible to find the perimeter of this trapezium with the given information."
