    "message_1": "Given that the probability of a certain type of financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.03, what is the probability that at least 2 out of 100 randomly selected companies will experience this type of financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of at least 2 companies experiencing financial fraud, we can find the probability of 0 or 1 company experiencing financial fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (companies), x is the number of successful trials (companies with fraud), p is the probability of success (fraud), and q is the probability of failure (no fraud).\n\nIn this case, n = 100, p = 0.03, and q = 1 - p = 0.97.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of 0 companies experiencing financial fraud:\n\nP(0) = (100C0) * (0.03^0) * (0.97^100)\nP(0) = 1 * 1 * (0.97^100)\nP(0) ≈ 0.047\n\nNow, let's find the probability of 1 company experiencing financial fraud:\n\nP(1) = (100C1) * (0.03^1) * (0.97^99)\nP(1) = 100 * 0.03 * (0.97^99)\nP(1) ≈ 0.367\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(at least 2) = 1 - P(0) - P(1)\nP(at least 2) = 1 - 0.047 - 0.367\nP(at least 2) ≈ 0.586\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 out of 100 randomly selected companies will experience this type of financial fraud is approximately 0.586 or 58.6%."
