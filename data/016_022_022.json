    "message_2": "To find the total number of triangles in the 7th stage of the Sierpinski pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of triangles = Initial number of triangles * (Multiplier)^(Stage number)\n\nIn this case, the initial number of triangles is 1 (a single equilateral triangle at stage 0), the multiplier is 3 (each stage triples the number of triangles), and the stage number is 7.\n\nTotal number of triangles = 1 * (3)^7\nTotal number of triangles = 1 * 2187\nTotal number of triangles = 2187\n\nSo, there are 2187 triangles in the 7th stage of the Sierpinski pyramid."
