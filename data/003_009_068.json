    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the right-angled triangle, we first need to find the length of the other two sides. We are given the base (12 cm) and one angle (60 degrees). Since it's a right-angled triangle, the other angle is 30 degrees (90 - 60 = 30).\n\nWe can use the sine and cosine functions to find the length of the other two sides. Let's denote the base as 'a' (12 cm), the height as 'b', and the hypotenuse as 'c'.\n\nsin(30) = opposite side (b) / hypotenuse (c)\ncos(30) = adjacent side (a) / hypotenuse (c)\n\nWe know the base (a) is 12 cm, so we can use the cosine function to find the hypotenuse (c):\n\ncos(30) = 12 / c\nc * cos(30) = 12\nc = 12 / cos(30)\n\ncos(30) = √3/2, so:\n\nc = 12 / (√3/2)\nc = 12 * 2 / √3\nc = 24 / √3\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by √3:\n\nc = (24 * √3) / (3)\nc = 8√3 cm\n\nNow, we can use the sine function to find the height (b):\n\nsin(30) = b / (8√3)\nb = sin(30) * 8√3\n\nsin(30) = 1/2, so:\n\nb = (1/2) * 8√3\nb = 4√3 cm\n\nNow that we have all three side lengths, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 12 + 4√3 + 8√3\nPerimeter = 12 + 12√3 cm"
