    "message_2": "To factor the given polynomial 3x^3 + 12x^2 - 15x, we first look for the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients and the variable.\n\nThe GCF of the coefficients 3, 12, and -15 is 3. The GCF of the variable x is x since it is present in all the terms.\n\nSo, we can factor out 3x from the polynomial:\n\n3x(x^2 + 4x - 5)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses (x^2 + 4x - 5). We are looking for two numbers that multiply to -5 and add up to 4. These numbers are 5 and -1.\n\nSo, we can factor the quadratic expression as (x + 5)(x - 1).\n\nNow, the completely factored polynomial is:\n\n3x(x + 5)(x - 1)"
