    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 15 cm and a minor radius of 7 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the minor radius of the torus and major_radius is the major radius of the torus.\n\nGiven that the major radius is 15 cm and the minor radius is 7 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * 7^2) * (2 * π * 15)\n\nVolume = (π * 49) * (30 * π)\n\nVolume = 1470 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 14451.56 cubic centimeters."
