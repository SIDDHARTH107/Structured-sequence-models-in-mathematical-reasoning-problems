    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time, while each unit of product B requires 5 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time. The company has 250 labors and 150 machine hours available each day. Product A generates a profit of $5 per unit, and product B generates a profit of $7 per unit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine hours are as follows:\n\n3x + 5y ≤ 250 (labor hours)\n2x + y ≤ 150 (machine hours)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 5x + 7y\n\nTo find the solution, we will first graph the constraints and find the feasible region.\n\nThe constraints can be rewritten as:\n\ny ≤ (250 - 3x)/5\ny ≤ 150 - 2x\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the intersection points of the constraints:\n\n1. Intersection of y = (250 - 3x)/5 and y = 150 - 2x:\n\n(250 - 3x)/5 = 150 - 2x\n250 - 3x = 750 - 10x\n7x = 500\nx = 500/7 ≈ 71.43\n\ny = 150 - 2(500/7) = 150 - 1000/7 ≈ 28.57\n\n2. Intersection of y = (250 - 3x)/5 and x = 0:\n\ny = (250 - 3(0))/5 = 250/5 = 50\n\n3. Intersection of y = 150 - 2x and x = 0:\n\ny = 150 - 2(0) = 150\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 5x + 7y at each of the vertices:\n\n1. P(71.43, 28.57) = 5(71.43) + 7(28.57) ≈ 357.15 + 200 = 557.15\n2. P(0, 50) = 5(0) + 7(50) = 350\n3. P(0, 150) = 5(0) + 7(150) = 1050\n\nSince the feasible region is bounded, we can see that the maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 150) with a profit of $1050. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 150 units of product B to maximize their profit."
