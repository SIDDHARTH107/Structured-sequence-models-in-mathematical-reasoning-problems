    "message_2": "To compute the second cohomology group $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the projective algebraic variety given by the equation $X^3 + Y^3 + Z^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.\n\nThe Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that if $X \\subset \\mathbb{P}^n$ is a smooth projective variety of dimension $k$ and $H \\subset \\mathbb{P}^n$ is a hyperplane such that $X \\cap H$ is also smooth, then the restriction map $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^i(X \\cap H, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and an injection for $i = k$.\n\nIn our case, $X$ is a smooth cubic curve in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, so it has dimension $k = 1$. The hyperplane $H$ can be any line in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. Since $X$ is a smooth curve, it intersects $H$ transversely, so $X \\cap H$ is also smooth.\n\nBy the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have an isomorphism $H^i(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^i(X \\cap H, \\mathbb{Z})$ for $i < 1$ and an injection for $i = 1$. Since $X \\cap H$ is a finite set of points, we have $H^2(X \\cap H, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Therefore, the second cohomology group of our variety is:\n\n$$H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^2(X \\cap H, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0.$$"
