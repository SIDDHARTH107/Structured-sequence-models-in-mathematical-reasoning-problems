    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1, we first need to find its derivative, f'(x).\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as these are the critical points.\n\n3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is not easy, so we'll use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 3, b = -6, and c = 2.\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(3)(2))) / (2 * 3)\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 24)) / 6\nx = (6 ± √12) / 6\n\nNow, we have two possible values for x:\n\nx1 = (6 + √12) / 6\nx2 = (6 - √12) / 6\n\nThese are the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1."
