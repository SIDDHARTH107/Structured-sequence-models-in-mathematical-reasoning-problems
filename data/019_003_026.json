    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve on Modal Logic:\n\nLet P be the statement \"It's raining today\" and Q be the statement \"I will carry an umbrella\". Translate the following sentence into propositional logic, and determine whether it is true, false, or neither true nor false:\n\"If it's raining today, then I will carry an umbrella.\"\n\nSolution: Let R represent \"If it's raining today, then I will carry an umbrella.\" The statement represented by R is a conditional statement, which can be written as P → Q. To determine whether R is true, false, or neither true nor false, we need to look at the truth values of P and Q.\n\nSuppose it is raining today, which means that P is true. We don't know anything about whether Q is true or false, so we can't make any conclusions about whether R is true or false. Therefore, R is neither true nor false.\n\nNow suppose it is not raining today, which means that P is false. In this case, R is vacuously true because a conditional statement with a false hypothesis is always true, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion. Therefore, R is true.\n\nIn summary, R (which represents the statement \"If it's raining today, then I will carry an umbrella\") is neither true nor false when it is raining today, and it is true when it is not raining today.",
    "message_2": "The given problem has already been solved correctly. The statement \"If it's raining today, then I will carry an umbrella\" can be represented as a conditional statement R, which can be written as P → Q. The truth value of R depends on the truth values of P and Q.\n\nWhen it is raining today (P is true), we cannot determine the truth value of R because we do not know the truth value of Q. In this case, R is neither true nor false.\n\nWhen it is not raining today (P is false), R is vacuously true because a conditional statement with a false hypothesis is always true, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement R is neither true nor false when it is raining today, and it is true when it is not raining today."
