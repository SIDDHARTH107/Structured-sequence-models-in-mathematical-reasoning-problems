    "message_2": "The power set of a set is the set of all possible subsets of that set, including the empty set and the set itself. The empty set, denoted as ∅, has no elements. Therefore, the only subset of the empty set is the empty set itself.\n\nSo, the power set of the empty set is {∅}, which contains only one element."
