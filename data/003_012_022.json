    "message_2": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the point to the base of the tower (50 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the tower (which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 50\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3:\n\n√3 = height / 50\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 50 * √3\n\nheight ≈ 50 * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 86.6\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the tower is approximately 87 meters."
