    "message_2": "To find the percentage of households that own either a dog or a cat but not both, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nFirst, we add the percentages of households that own a dog and those that own a cat: 30% + 20% = 50%.\n\nNext, we subtract the percentage of households that own both a dog and a cat, since they were counted twice in the previous step: 50% - 10% = 40%.\n\nSo, 40% of households own either a dog or a cat, but not both."
