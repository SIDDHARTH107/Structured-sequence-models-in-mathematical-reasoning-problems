    "message_2": "We can use the right triangle formed by the ladder, the ground, and the wall to find the angle of inclination. Let's call the angle of inclination θ.\n\nWe are given the length of the ladder (the hypotenuse) as 10 meters and the distance of the bottom of the ladder from the wall (the adjacent side) as 6 meters. We can use the cosine function to find the angle θ:\n\ncos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse\ncos(θ) = 6 / 10\ncos(θ) = 0.6\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse cosine (also known as arccosine) of 0.6 to find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(0.6)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 53.13 degrees\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle of inclination that the ladder makes with the ground is approximately 53 degrees."
