    "message_2": "1. To find the rank of the matrix A, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by row reducing the matrix to its row-echelon form or reduced row-echelon form.\n\n2. Let's find the reduced row-echelon form of A:\n\nA = [1 2 3;\n     4 5 6;\n     7 8 9]\n\nStep 1: Subtract 4 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 7 times the first row from the third row:\n\nA = [1  2  3;\n     0 -3 -6;\n     0 -6 -12]\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3:\n\nA = [1  2  3;\n     0  1  2;\n     0 -6 -12]\n\nStep 3: Add 6 times the second row to the third row, and subtract 2 times the second row from the first row:\n\nA = [1  0 -1;\n     0  1  2;\n     0  0  0]\n\nThe reduced row-echelon form of A is:\n\n[1  0 -1;\n 0  1  2;\n 0  0  0]\n\nNow, we can see that there are 2 linearly independent rows (the first and second rows). Therefore, the rank of the matrix A is 2."
