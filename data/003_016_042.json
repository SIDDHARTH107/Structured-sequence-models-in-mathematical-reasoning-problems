    "message_1": "A sine function has a phase shift of π/4 and an amplitude of 5. If the period of the function is 4π, what is the equation of the function?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the sine function with the given information, we can use the general form of a sine function:\n\ny = A * sin(B(x - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In this case, we have:\n\nAmplitude (A) = 5\nPhase shift (C) = π/4\nPeriod = 4π\n\nTo find the value of B, we use the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π/B\n\nSo, 4π = 2π/B, which implies B = 1/2.\n\nSince there is no mention of a vertical shift, we can assume D = 0. Now, we can plug in the values into the general equation:\n\ny = 5 * sin((1/2)(x - π/4))"
