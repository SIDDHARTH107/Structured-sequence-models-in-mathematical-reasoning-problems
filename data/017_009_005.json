    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 9. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and also satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Since the order of G is 9, the only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. \n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be this unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Then, |P| = 3, and P is cyclic (since all groups of prime order are cyclic). Let x be a generator of P, so the order of x is 3. \n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. It has order |G|/|P| = 9/3 = 3, so G/P is also cyclic. Let yP be a generator of G/P, where y is an element of G. Then, the order of yP is 3, which means that (yP)^3 = y^3P = P, and thus y^3 ∈ P. Since x has order 3, we have y^3 = x^k for some integer k with 0 ≤ k ≤ 2. If k = 0, then y^3 = e (the identity element), which contradicts the fact that the order of yP is 3. Therefore, k must be 1 or 2. In either case, the order of the element xy is 9 (since (xy)^3 = x^3y^3 = e and (xy)^9 = x^9y^9 = e). Thus, G has an element of order 9, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three 3-Sylow subgroups, let P, Q, and R be distinct 3-Sylow subgroups of G. Since the intersection of any two distinct 3-Sylow subgroups is trivial (i.e., contains only the identity element), we have:\n\n|G| = |P| + |Q| + |R| - 3 + 1 = 3 + 3 + 3 - 3 + 1 = 9\n\nLet x be a generator of P, y be a generator of Q, and z be a generator of R. Then, the orders of x, y, and z are all 3. Since G has order 9, any element in G can be written as a product of powers of x and y (as z can be expressed as a product of x and y as well). \n\nNow, we need to show that G is non-abelian. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that G is abelian. Then, for any elements a and b in G, we have ab = ba. In particular, we have xy = yx. But then, the element xy has order 9, which contradicts the fact that G has no elements of order 9 (as we assumed n_3 = 3). Therefore, G must be non-abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a group G of order 9 is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C9 (if it has an element of order 9) or is a non-abelian group with elements of order 3 (if it has three distinct 3-Sylow subgroups)."
