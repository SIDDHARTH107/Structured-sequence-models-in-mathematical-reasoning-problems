    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 5 cm, a width of 3 cm, and a height of 4 cm. Find its surface area.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to calculate the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area (SA) of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: l = 5 cm, w = 3 cm, and h = 4 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSA = 2(5)(3) + 2(5)(4) + 2(3)(4)\nSA = 2(15) + 2(20) + 2(12)\nSA = 30 + 40 + 24\nSA = 94 cmÂ²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 94 square centimeters."
