    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first write the augmented matrix for the system, then use Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form, and finally back-substitute to find the solution.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n```\n| 2  3  1 | 10 |\n| 1 -2 -3 | -5 |\n| 3  1  2 |  8 |\n```\n\nFirst, we will swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n```\n| 1 -2 -3 | -5 |\n| 2  3  1 | 10 |\n| 3  1  2 |  8 |\n```\n\nNext, we will eliminate the 2 and 3 in the first column below the 1. To do this, we will replace Row 2 with Row 2 - 2 * Row 1, and replace Row 3 with Row 3 - 3 * Row 1:\n\nRow 2: (2, 3, 1, 10) - 2 * (1, -2, -3, -5) = (0, 7, 7, 20)\nRow 3: (3, 1, 2, 8) - 3 * (1, -2, -3, -5) = (0, 7, 11, 23)\n\n```\n| 1 -2 -3 | -5  |\n| 0  7  7 | 20  |\n| 0  7 11 | 23  |\n```\n\nNow, we will eliminate the 7 in the second column below the first row. Replace Row 3 with Row 3 - Row 2:\n\nRow 3: (0, 7, 11, 23) - (0, 7, 7, 20) = (0, 0, 4, 3)\n\n```\n| 1 -2 -3 | -5 |\n| 0  7  7 | 20 |\n| 0  0  4 |  3 |\n```\n\nNow we have the row echelon form of the matrix. We can now back-substitute to find the solution.\n\nFrom the third row, we have 4z = 3, so z = 3/4.\n\nFrom the second row, we have 7y + 7z = 20, so y + z = 20/7. Substituting the value of z, we get y + 3/4 = 20/7, so y = (20/7) - (3/4) = (80 - 21) / 28 = 59/28.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x - 2y - 3z = -5. Substituting the values of y and z, we get x - 2(59/28) - 3(3/4) = -5, so x = -5 + (118/28) + (9/4) = (-140 + 118 + 63) / 28 = 41/28.\n\nSo the particular solution of this non-homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 41/28\ny = 59/28\nz = 3/4"
