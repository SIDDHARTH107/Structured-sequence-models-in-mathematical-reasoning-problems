    "message_1": "A right triangle has one angle measuring 60° and the hypotenuse measures 10 meters. What is the length of the side opposite the 60° angle?",
    "message_2": "In a right triangle, the side opposite the 60° angle is the longer leg, and the side opposite the 30° angle is the shorter leg. We can use the sine function to find the length of the side opposite the 60° angle.\n\nsin(60°) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nsin(60°) = opposite side / 10\n\nTo find the sine of 60°, we can use the fact that sin(60°) = √3/2.\n\n√3/2 = opposite side / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the opposite side:\n\nopposite side = 10 * (√3/2)\n\nopposite side = 5√3\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite the 60° angle is 5√3 meters."
