    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = |  2  1 -1 |\n    | -1  3  2 |\n    |  3 -2  5 |\n\nb = |  8  |\n    | -11 |\n    |  29 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A, where A = QR. Q is an orthogonal matrix, and R is an upper triangular matrix.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal basis for the column space of A:\n\nu1 = (2, -1, 3)\nu2 = (1, 3, -2) - (1/7)(2, -1, 3) = (1/7)(3, 20, -13)\nu3 = (-1, 2, 5) - (1/7)(2, -1, 3) - (5/49)(3, 20, -13) = (1/49)(-36, 5, 62)\n\nNow, normalize the orthogonal basis to obtain the orthonormal basis:\n\nq1 = u1 / ||u1|| = (2, -1, 3) / sqrt(14) = (1/sqrt(14))(2, -1, 3)\nq2 = u2 / ||u2|| = (1/7)(3, 20, -13) / sqrt(194/49) = (1/sqrt(194))(3, 20, -13)\nq3 = u3 / ||u3|| = (1/49)(-36, 5, 62) / sqrt(5341/49) = (1/sqrt(5341))(-36, 5, 62)\n\nNow, we can form the Q and R matrices:\n\nQ = | (1/sqrt(14))   (1/sqrt(194))   (1/sqrt(5341))(-36) |\n    | (-1/sqrt(14))  (1/sqrt(194))(20) (1/sqrt(5341))(5)  |\n    | (3/sqrt(14))  (1/sqrt(194))(-13) (1/sqrt(5341))(62) |\n\nR = | sqrt(14)  (1/sqrt(14))(2)  (1/sqrt(14))(-1)  |\n    |   0       sqrt(194/7)     (1/sqrt(194))(5)  |\n    |   0         0             sqrt(5341/49)     |\n\nNow, we can solve the system Rx = Q^Tb:\n\nQ^Tb = | (1/sqrt(14))(2)   (-1/sqrt(14))(-1)  (3/sqrt(14))(1)  | |  8  |\n       | (1/sqrt(194))(3)  (1/sqrt(194))(20) (1/sqrt(194))(-13)| | -11 |\n       | (1/sqrt(5341))(-36)(1/sqrt(5341))(5) (1/sqrt(5341))(62)| |  29 |\n\nQ^Tb = |  1.00 |\n       | -1.00 |\n       |  2.00 |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^Tb using back substitution:\n\nR = | sqrt(14)  (1/sqrt(14))(2)  (1/sqrt(14))(-1)  | | x |   |  1.00 |\n    |   0       sqrt(194/7)     (1/sqrt(194))(5)  | | y | = | -1.00 |\n    |   0         0             sqrt(5341/49)     | | z |   |  2.00 |\n\nSolving for x, y, and z, we get:\n\nx ≈ 1.00\ny ≈ 2.00\nz ≈ 3.00\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately x = 1.00, y = 2.00, and z = 3.00, rounded to two decimal places."
