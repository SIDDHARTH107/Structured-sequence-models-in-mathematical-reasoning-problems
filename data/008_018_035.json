    "message_2": "To write the equivalent system of linear equations using block matrices, we can represent the system as AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  1 |\n    | 4  5  3 |\n    | 3  2  4 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | 20 |\n    | 15 |\n\nSo, the block matrix representation is:\n\n| 2  3  1 | | x |   | 10 |\n| 4  5  3 | | y | = | 20 |\n| 3  2  4 | | z |   | 15 |\n\nTo solve for the values of x, y, and z, we can use the matrix inversion method. First, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A_inv. Then, we can multiply A_inv by B to get the values of X.\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = 2(5*4 - 3*2) - 3(4*4 - 3*3) + 1(4*2 - 3*5)\n       = 2(20 - 6) - 3(16 - 9) + 1(8 - 15)\n       = 2(14) - 3(7) - 7\n       = 28 - 21 - 7\n       = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, A is a singular matrix and it does not have an inverse. Therefore, we cannot use the matrix inversion method to solve this system of linear equations.\n\nInstead, we can use other methods such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule to solve the system. In this case, let's use Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation to eliminate x from the second equation:\n\n   New second equation: -1y + z = 0\n\n2. Multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation to eliminate x from the third equation:\n\n   New third equation: -7y + 7z = 5\n\n3. Divide the new third equation by -7:\n\n   New third equation: y - z = -1\n\n4. Add the new second and third equations to eliminate y:\n\n   z = 1\n\n5. Substitute the value of z into the new third equation to find y:\n\n   y - 1 = -1\n   y = 0\n\n6. Substitute the values of y and z into the first equation to find x:\n\n   2x + 3(0) + 1 = 10\n   2x = 10\n   x = 5\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is x = 5, y = 0, and z = 1."
