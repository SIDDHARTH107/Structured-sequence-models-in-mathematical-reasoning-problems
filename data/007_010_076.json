Now, he has been given the following problem to solve:\n\nConsider the system of equations:\nx ≡ 2 (mod 3)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n\nWhat is the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the above system of equations?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we need to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the given system of equations.\n\nFirst, let's find the product of the moduli: N = 3 * 7 * 11 = 231.\n\nNext, we need to find the partial products:\nN1 = N / 3 = 231 / 3 = 77\nN2 = N / 7 = 231 / 7 = 33\nN3 = N / 11 = 231 / 11 = 21\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\ny1 ≡ N1^(-1) (mod 3) => 77^(-1) ≡ 2 (mod 3)\ny2 ≡ N2^(-1) (mod 7) => 33^(-1) ≡ 1 (mod 7)\ny3 ≡ N3^(-1) (mod 11) => 21^(-1) ≡ 8 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we can find x using the formula:\nx = (a1 * N1 * y1) + (a2 * N2 * y2) + (a3 * N3 * y3) (mod N)\n\nPlugging in the values from the given system of equations:\nx = (2 * 77 * 2) + (3 * 33 * 1) + (5 * 21 * 8) (mod 231)\nx = (308) + (99) + (840) (mod 231)\nx = 1247 (mod 231)\n\nNow, we can find the smallest positive integer x:\nx = 1247 % 231 = 89\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the given system of equations is 89."
