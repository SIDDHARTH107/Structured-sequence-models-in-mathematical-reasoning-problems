    "message_2": "The given equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 represents a 2-dimensional sphere S^2 in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. To determine the number of symmetries of M, we need to find the isometries of the sphere.\n\nAn isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points on the manifold. In the case of a sphere, these transformations are rotations and reflections. The group of isometries of a sphere is called the orthogonal group O(3).\n\nThe orthogonal group O(3) consists of two types of transformations: proper rotations (which preserve orientation) and improper rotations (which reverse orientation). The group of proper rotations is called the special orthogonal group SO(3), and the group of improper rotations is called the special orthogonal group with determinant -1, denoted as O(3) \\ SO(3).\n\nThe number of symmetries of M is equal to the order of the orthogonal group O(3). The order of SO(3) is infinite, as there are infinitely many possible rotation angles around any axis. The order of O(3) \\ SO(3) is also infinite, as there are infinitely many possible reflection planes.\n\nTherefore, the number of symmetries of M is infinite."
