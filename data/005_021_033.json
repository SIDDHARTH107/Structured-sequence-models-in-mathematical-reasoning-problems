    "message_1": "A math student wants to estimate the average height of a population. She takes a random sample of 100 people and finds that the mean height is 168 cm and the standard deviation is 5 cm. Using bootstrapping technique, she wants to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height. Compute the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.",
    "message_2": "To compute the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height using the bootstrapping technique, we first need to find the standard error of the mean (SEM). The SEM is calculated as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size:\n\nSEM = standard deviation / sqrt(sample size)\nSEM = 5 cm / sqrt(100)\nSEM = 5 cm / 10\nSEM = 0.5 cm\n\nNext, we need to find the critical value for a 95% confidence interval. For a normal distribution, the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 1.96.\n\nNow, we can calculate the margin of error (ME) by multiplying the critical value by the SEM:\n\nME = critical value * SEM\nME = 1.96 * 0.5 cm\nME = 0.98 cm\n\nFinally, we can compute the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval by subtracting and adding the margin of error from the sample mean, respectively:\n\nLower bound = sample mean - ME\nLower bound = 168 cm - 0.98 cm\nLower bound ≈ 167.02 cm\n\nUpper bound = sample mean + ME\nUpper bound = 168 cm + 0.98 cm\nUpper bound ≈ 168.98 cm\n\nTherefore, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean height is approximately 167.02 cm to 168.98 cm."
