    "message_2": "A simplicial complex is a set of simplices that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. Every face of a simplex in the complex is also in the complex.\n2. The intersection of any two simplices in the complex is a face of both of them.\n\nIn this problem, we have a simplicial complex $K$ with 5 vertices and 8 edges. We want to find the maximum number of faces that $K$ can have.\n\nFirst, let's consider the maximum number of 2-dimensional faces (triangles) that can be formed with 5 vertices. This can be done by choosing any 3 vertices out of 5, which is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\n$\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$\n\nSo, there can be at most 10 triangles in the simplicial complex.\n\nHowever, we are given that there are only 8 edges in the simplicial complex. Since each triangle has 3 edges, and each edge can be part of at most 2 triangles, we can have at most $\\frac{8 \\times 2}{3} = \\frac{16}{3} \\approx 5.33$ triangles. Since we cannot have a fraction of a triangle, we can have at most 5 triangles in the simplicial complex.\n\nNow, let's count the total number of faces in the simplicial complex. We have:\n\n- 5 vertices (0-dimensional faces)\n- 8 edges (1-dimensional faces)\n- 5 triangles (2-dimensional faces)\n\nSo, the maximum number of faces that $K$ can have is $5 + 8 + 5 = 18$."
