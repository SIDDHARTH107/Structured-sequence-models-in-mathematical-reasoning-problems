    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set is a subset of every set, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of any given set. Let's denote the empty set as B = {} and any arbitrary set as A.\n\nBy definition, a set B is a subset of set A (denoted as B ⊆ A) if and only if every element of B is also an element of A. In other words, for all x, if x ∈ B, then x ∈ A.\n\nNow, let's consider the empty set B = {}. By definition, the empty set has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements x such that x ∈ B. \n\nSince there are no elements in B, there are no elements that need to be checked for membership in A. Consequently, the condition \"for all x, if x ∈ B, then x ∈ A\" is trivially true, as there are no elements in B to begin with.\n\nThus, the empty set B is a subset of any arbitrary set A, which means the empty set is a subset of every set."
