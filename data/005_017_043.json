Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix.\n2. Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and their corresponding eigenvectors.\n3. Calculate the proportion of total variance explained by each principal component.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix:\n\nUsing a software or calculator to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the given correlation matrix, we get:\n\nEigenvalues: λ1 = 2.924, λ2 = 1.171, λ3 = 0.663, λ4 = 0.169, λ5 = 0.073\nEigenvectors:\nv1 = [0.449, 0.469, -0.418, 0.467, 0.397]\nv2 = [-0.125, -0.221, -0.568, 0.777, -0.104]\nv3 = [0.720, -0.672, -0.091, 0.045, 0.162]\nv4 = [-0.481, -0.507, -0.693, -0.131, 0.179]\nv5 = [0.202, -0.207, 0.161, 0.354, 0.873]\n\n2.

Calculate the proportion of total variance explained by each principal component:\n\nThe total variance is the sum of all eigenvalues: 2.924 + 1.171 + 0.663 + 0.169 + 0.073 = 5 (since it's a correlation matrix, the total variance is equal to the number of variables)\n\nNow, we can find the proportion of total variance explained by each principal component:\n\nPC1: 2.924 / 5 = 0.5848 (58.48%)\nPC2: 1.171 / 5 = 0.2342 (23.42%)\nPC3: 0.663 / 5 = 0.1326 (13.26%)\nPC4: 0.169 / 5 = 0.0338 (3.38%)\nPC5: 0.073 / 5 = 0.0146 (1.46%)\n\nSo, the proportion of total variance explained by each principal component is:\n\nPC1: 58.48%\nPC2: 23.42%\nPC3: 13.26%\nPC4: 3.38%\nPC5: 1.46%"
