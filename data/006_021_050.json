    "message_2": "To find the probability of a flood occurring in a particular town during the month of July, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, floods) occurring in a fixed interval of time (in this case, one month).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given time interval\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of events in the given time interval\n- k is the number of events we are interested in (in this case, 1 flood)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of floods per month (λ). Since there is a historical average of 0.5 floods per year, we can divide this by 12 to find the average number of floods per month:\n\nλ = 0.5 floods/year * (1 year / 12 months) = 0.04167 floods/month\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson distribution formula to find the probability of 1 flood occurring in the month of July:\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-0.04167) * 0.04167^1) / 1!\n\nP(X = 1) = (0.95913 * 0.04167) / 1 = 0.03998\n\nSo, the probability of a flood occurring in the particular town during the month of July is approximately 3.998% or 0.03998."
