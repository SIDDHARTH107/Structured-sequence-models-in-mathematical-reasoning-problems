Assume that $0$ is a regular value of $f$, and let $k$ be the number of critical points of $f$. Prove the Morse inequality:\n$$H_i(S^n) \\geq \\sum_{j=0}^{i-k}(-1)^j\\binom{k}{i-j}$$\n\nAs a numerical example, consider the case when $n=3$ and $f:S^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is defined by $f(x,y,z,t)=x^4+y^4+z^4+t^4$. Determine the number of critical points of $f$ and calculate the total homology $H_i(S^3)$ using the Morse inequality.",
    "message_2": "To prove the Morse inequality, we will use the Morse theory. Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $f: M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function with a finite number of non-degenerate critical points. Let $C_i$ be the number of critical points of index $i$. Then, the Morse inequalities state that for each $i$,\n$$H_i(M) \\geq C_i - C_{i-1} + C_{i-2} - \\cdots$$\n\nNow, let's consider the smooth map $f: S^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with $k$ critical points. We can order the critical points by their index, so that $C_0 \\leq C_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq C_k$. Then, the Morse inequality for $S^n$ can be written as\n$$H_i(S^n) \\geq \\sum_{j=0}^{i-k}(-1)^j\\binom{k}{i-j}$$\n\nNow, let's consider the numerical example with $n=3$ and $f:S^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x,y,z,t)=x^4+y^4+z^4+t^4$. To find the critical points of $f$, we need to find the points where the gradient of $f$ is zero. The gradient of $f$ is given by\n$$\\nabla f = (4x^3, 4y^3, 4z^3, 4t^3)$$\n\nThe gradient is zero when $x^3 = y^3 = z^3 = t^3 = 0$. Since $S^3$ is the 3-dimensional sphere, we have the constraint $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2 = 1$. The only solutions to these equations are the four points $(\\pm 1, 0, 0, 0)$, $(0, \\pm 1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 0, \\pm 1, 0)$, and $(0, 0, 0, \\pm 1)$. Thus, there are $k=8$ critical points.\n\nNow, we can use the Morse inequality to calculate the total homology $H_i(S^3)$. Since $S^3$ is a 3-dimensional sphere, we know that $H_0(S^3) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_3(S^3) = \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_i(S^3) = 0$ for $i \\neq 0, 3$. Using the Morse inequality, we have\n$$H_0(S^3) \\geq \\sum_{j=0}^{0}(-1)^j\\binom{8}{0} = 1$$\n$$H_1(S^3) \\geq \\sum_{j=0}^{1-8}(-1)^j\\binom{8}{1-j} = 0$$\n$$H_2(S^3) \\geq \\sum_{j=0}^{2-8}(-1)^j\\binom{8}{2-j} = 0$$\n$$H_3(S^3) \\geq \\sum_{j=0}^{3-8}(-1)^j\\binom{8}{3-j} = 1$$\n\nThus, the total homology of $S^3$ is $H_0(S^3) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_3(S^3) = \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_i(S^3) = 0$ for $i \\neq 0, 3$."
