    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6, we can try to find a factor using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root p/q, then p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is 6 and the leading coefficient is 1. The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6. We can test these roots by plugging them into the polynomial and checking if the result is zero.\n\nWhen we plug in x = -1, we get:\n\n(-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 11(-1) + 6 = -1 + 6 - 11 + 6 = 0\n\nSince the result is zero, x = -1 is a root of the polynomial, and (x + 1) is a factor.\n\nNow, we can perform polynomial division to find the other factors:\n\n         x^2 + 5x + 6\n(x + 1) | x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6\n         - (x^3 + x^2)\n         -------------------\n               5x^2 + 11x\n               - (5x^2 + 5x)\n               ----------------\n                     6x + 6\n                     - (6x + 6)\n                     -------------\n                           0\n\nSo, the polynomial can be written as (x + 1)(x^2 + 5x + 6).\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic x^2 + 5x + 6:\n\nx^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)\n\nSo, the fully factored polynomial is:\n\nx^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 = (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)"
