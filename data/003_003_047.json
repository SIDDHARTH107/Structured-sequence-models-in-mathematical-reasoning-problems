    "message_2": "To find the exact value of sine 240° using the unit circle, we first need to convert 240° to radians. \n\n1° = π/180 radians, so 240° = (240 * π) / 180 = 4π/3 radians.\n\nNow, we can use the unit circle to find the sine value. Since 240° is in the third quadrant, both the x and y coordinates will be negative. We can find the reference angle (the angle between the terminal side of the angle and the x-axis) by subtracting 180° from 240°:\n\n240° - 180° = 60°\n\nThe reference angle is 60°, which is equivalent to π/3 radians. We can now use the 30-60-90 triangle properties to find the sine value for the reference angle:\n\nsin(π/3) = √3/2\n\nSince the original angle is in the third quadrant, the sine value will be negative:\n\nsin(4π/3) = -√3/2"
