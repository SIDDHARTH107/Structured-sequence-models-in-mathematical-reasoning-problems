    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm. What is the surface area of the cone (rounded to the nearest hundredth)?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle, so we can find its area using the formula for the area of a circle:\nA_base = π * r^2\nA_base = π * (5 cm)^2\nA_base = 25π cm^2\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. To do this, we first need to find the slant height of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this:\nslant height (s) = √(r^2 + h^2)\ns = √((5 cm)^2 + (10 cm)^2)\ns = √(25 cm^2 + 100 cm^2)\ns = √(125 cm^2)\ns = 5√5 cm\n\nNow we can find the lateral surface area using the formula:\nA_lateral = π * r * s\nA_lateral = π * (5 cm) * (5√5 cm)\nA_lateral = 25π√5 cm^2\n\nFinally, we add the base area and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area of the cone:\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 25π cm^2 + 25π√5 cm^2\n\nTo round to the nearest hundredth, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14:\nA_total ≈ 25 * 3.14 + 25 * 3.14 * √5\nA_total ≈ 78.5 + 78.5 * √5\nA_total ≈ 78.5 + 175.24\nA_total ≈ 253.74 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is approximately 253.74 cm^2, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
