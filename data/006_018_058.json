    "message_1": "What is the probability that a company with 100 employees will experience at least one case of embezzlement in a year, given that the historical data shows that on average, 2% of employees commit embezzlement annually?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complement probability. The complement of at least one employee committing embezzlement is that no employee commits embezzlement.\n\nThe probability of a single employee not committing embezzlement in a year is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nFor all 100 employees not to commit embezzlement, the probability is (0.98)^100.\n\nNow, we find the complement of this probability to find the probability of at least one employee committing embezzlement:\n\n1 - (0.98)^100 â‰ˆ 0.867.\n\nSo, the probability that a company with 100 employees will experience at least one case of embezzlement in a year is approximately 86.7%."
