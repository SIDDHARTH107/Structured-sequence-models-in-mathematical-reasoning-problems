    "message_2": "The moduli space of smooth genus 2 algebraic curves is denoted by M_2. The dimension of M_2 is given by the formula:\n\ndim(M_g) = 3g - 3,\n\nwhere g is the genus of the curve. In our case, g = 2, so the dimension of M_2 is:\n\ndim(M_2) = 3 * 2 - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3.\n\nNow, we need to consider the marked point. The moduli space of smooth genus 2 algebraic curves with a marked point is denoted by M_{2,1}. The dimension of M_{2,1} is given by the formula:\n\ndim(M_{g,n}) = 3g - 3 + n,\n\nwhere g is the genus of the curve and n is the number of marked points. In our case, g = 2 and n = 1, so the dimension of M_{2,1} is:\n\ndim(M_{2,1}) = 3 * 2 - 3 + 1 = 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the moduli space of smooth genus 2 algebraic curves with a marked point is 4."
