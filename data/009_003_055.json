    "message_1": "A metal plate with dimensions 2m x 3m is initially at a uniform temperature of 50 degrees Celsius. The edges of the plate are insulated and there are no heat sources or sinks inside the plate. After a few hours, the temperature distribution on the plate is given by:\n\nT(x, y) = 100x^2y^2 - 50\n\nwhere T is the temperature in degrees Celsius and (x, y) are the respective coordinates in meters. \n\nWhat is the temperature at the center of the plate?",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature at the center of the plate, we need to find the coordinates of the center. Since the dimensions of the plate are 2m x 3m, the center of the plate will be at (1, 1.5).\n\nNow we can plug these coordinates into the temperature distribution equation:\n\nT(x, y) = 100x^2y^2 - 50\nT(1, 1.5) = 100(1)^2(1.5)^2 - 50\nT(1, 1.5) = 100(1)(2.25) - 50\nT(1, 1.5) = 225 - 50\nT(1, 1.5) = 175\n\nSo, the temperature at the center of the plate is 175 degrees Celsius."
