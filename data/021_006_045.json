    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM) with a triangular mesh, we will follow these general steps:\n\n1. Discretize the domain\n2. Define the basis functions\n3. Formulate the weak form of the PDE\n4. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector\n5. Apply boundary conditions\n6. Solve the linear system\n7. Post-process the results\n\nStep 1: Discretize the domain\nDivide the domain [0, π] x [0, π] into a set of non-overlapping triangles. The quality of the solution depends on the mesh size and distribution of the triangles. For simplicity, let's assume we have a uniform mesh with N divisions along the x and y axes.\n\nStep 2: Define the basis functions\nFor each triangle, we define three linear basis functions (one for each vertex) that are equal to 1 at the corresponding vertex and 0 at the other vertices.\n\nStep 3: Formulate the weak form of the PDE\nMultiply the PDE by a test function v(x, y) and integrate over the domain. Then, apply integration by parts to the second-order derivatives to obtain the weak form:\n\n∫∫(∇u · ∇v - cos(x)v) dxdy = 0\n\nStep 4: Assemble the global stiffness matrix and load vector\nExpress the solution u(x, y) as a linear combination of the basis functions:\n\nu(x, y) = ∑ ciϕi(x, y)\n\nSubstitute this expression into the weak form and assemble the global stiffness matrix K and load vector F:\n\nKij = ∫∫(∇ϕi · ∇ϕj) dxdy\nFi = ∫∫(cos(x)ϕi) dxdy\n\nStep 5: Apply boundary conditions\nModify the stiffness matrix and load vector to incorporate the given boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, y) = 0\nu(π, y) = sin(2y)\nu(x, 0) = 0\nu(x, π) = 0\n\nStep 6: Solve the linear system\nSolve the linear system Kc = F for the coefficients c.\n\nStep 7: Post-process the results\nCompute the solution u(x, y) at any point in the domain using the obtained coefficients and the basis functions:\n\nu(x, y) = ∑ ciϕi(x, y)\n\nThis is a general outline of the finite element method applied to the given PDE with a triangular mesh. The actual implementation would require more detailed calculations and numerical techniques, such as Gaussian quadrature for integration and efficient linear solvers for solving the linear system."
