    "message_2": "To find the shortest path between node 1 and node 7, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. \n\n1. Create a set of unvisited nodes and initialize the distance of the starting node (node 1) to 0 and the distances of all other nodes to infinity.\n\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance (node 1) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (nodes 2 and 4).\n\n3. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 4) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (node 2).\n\n4. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 2) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (nodes 3 and 5).\n\n5. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 5) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its neighbors (nodes 3, 6, and 7).\n\n6. Select the next unvisited node with the smallest distance (node 7) and mark it as visited. Since this is the destination node, we can stop the algorithm.\n\nThe shortest path between node 1 and node 7 is 1 - 4 - 2 - 5 - 7, and the distance of this path is 1 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 9."
