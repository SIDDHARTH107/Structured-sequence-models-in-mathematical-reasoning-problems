    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G, which must be normal. In this case, G would be a cyclic group of order 27, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-cyclic. Therefore, n_3 = 3.\n\nLet P be a 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. There are two possibilities for the structure of P: either P is cyclic (isomorphic to Z_9) or P is isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_3. In either case, P is abelian, so its center Z(P) is nontrivial.\n\nNow, consider the action of G on P by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism φ: G → Aut(P), where Aut(P) is the group of automorphisms of P. The kernel of φ, denoted by K, is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in P. Since P is abelian, K is nontrivial.\n\nIf K = P, then P is a normal subgroup of G. But this would imply that G has a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that n_3 = 3. Therefore, K must be a proper subgroup of P. The only possibility for |K| is 3, since K is a subgroup of P and |P| = 9.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/K. Since |G/K| = |G|/|K| = 27/3 = 9, G/K is a group of order 9. Since G/K is abelian (being a group of order p^2, where p is prime), it follows that G' (the derived subgroup of G) is contained in K. Since |K| = 3, G' is a group of order 3.\n\nFinally, we have the following chain of subgroups:\n\n1 ⊆ G' ⊆ K ⊆ P ⊆ G\n\nwith |G'| = 3, |K| = 3, and |P| = 9. It follows that G is a non-abelian group of order 27 with a normal subgroup of order 9 and an abelian subgroup of order 3. This uniquely determines the structure of G up to isomorphism, so G must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27."
