    "message_1": "Let A be a set with 3 elements. Determine the size of A's power set and explain why it is always larger than A itself.",
    "message_2": "The power set of a set A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. To determine the size of the power set, we can use the formula:\n\n|P(A)| = 2^n\n\nwhere |P(A)| represents the size of the power set and n is the number of elements in set A.\n\nIn this case, set A has 3 elements, so n = 3. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\n|P(A)| = 2^3 = 8\n\nSo, the size of A's power set is 8.\n\nNow, let's explain why the power set is always larger than the set A itself. The power set includes all possible subsets of A, which means it includes the empty set, all singleton sets (sets with only one element), all pairs of elements, and so on, up to the set A itself. Since there are more combinations of elements in the power set than there are in A, the power set will always be larger than A.\n\nIn our example, set A has 3 elements, and its power set has 8 elements, which is larger than the size of A. This holds true for any set A, regardless of its size."
