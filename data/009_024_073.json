    "message_2": "To find the time it takes for the fluid to reach a steady state, we can use the concept of the time scale of the flow. The time scale is a characteristic time that describes how long it takes for the flow to evolve. In this case, we can use the time scale associated with the diffusion of momentum, which is given by:\n\n$t_{scale} = \\frac{L^2}{\\nu}$\n\nwhere $L$ is a characteristic length scale of the flow. Since we are dealing with a pipe flow, we can use the pipe radius $r$ as the characteristic length scale. Thus, we have:\n\n$t_{scale} = \\frac{r^2}{\\nu} = \\frac{(0.1)^2}{10^{-6}} = 10^4$ s\n\nThis time scale gives us an estimate of the time it takes for the fluid to reach a steady state. Note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual time may be slightly different due to the specific details of the flow. However, this estimate provides a good starting point for understanding the time scale of the problem.\n\nSo, it would take approximately $10^4$ seconds for the fluid to reach a steady state."
