    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, satisfies:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides 27\n\nThe possible values for n_3 are 1 and 27. If n_3 = 1, then there exists a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, which is normal in G. Let P be this unique 3-Sylow subgroup. Since |P| = 3^2 = 9, P is a group of order 9. By Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element of order 3 in G. Let H be the subgroup generated by this element, so |H| = 3.\n\nNow, we claim that G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and P. To prove this, we need to show that G = HP and H ∩ P = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\n1. G = HP: Since |H| = 3 and |P| = 9, and gcd(3, 9) = 1, we have |HP| = |H||P|/|H ∩ P| = 27. Since G has 27 elements, G = HP.\n\n2. H ∩ P = {e}: Suppose H ∩ P ≠ {e}. Then, there exists a non-identity element x in H ∩ P. The order of x must divide both |H| = 3 and |P| = 9. The only possibility is that the order of x is 3. However, this would imply that H is a subgroup of P, which is a contradiction since |H| does not divide |P|. Therefore, H ∩ P = {e}.\n\nSince G = HP and H ∩ P = {e}, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and P, where H is a cyclic group of order 3 and P is a group of order 9.\n\nIf n_3 = 27, then there is no normal 3-Sylow subgroup in G. In this case, G must be a simple group. However, the only simple group of order 27 is the cyclic group of order 27, so G is cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, either G is cyclic or G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
