    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of the entire function f(z) = z^3 - z^2 + 2z - 5 in the complex plane, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that a non-constant polynomial function of degree n has exactly n complex roots, counting multiplicities.\n\nIn this case, the function f(z) is a polynomial of degree 3. Therefore, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, f(z) has exactly 3 complex roots (zeros) in the complex plane."
