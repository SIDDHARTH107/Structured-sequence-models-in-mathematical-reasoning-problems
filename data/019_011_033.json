    "message_1": "Suppose P and Q are propositions such that P implies Q is true and Q implies P is false. If P is true, what is the truth value of Q?",
    "message_2": "If P is true and P implies Q is true, then Q must also be true. However, we are given that Q implies P is false. Since Q is true, the only way for Q implies P to be false is if P is false. But this contradicts our initial assumption that P is true.\n\nTherefore, the given conditions are inconsistent, and the problem cannot be solved with the given information."
