    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic logic is not typically associated with numerical problems. It is a branch of logic that deals with ethical concepts and the language used to express them. It's more about understanding the meanings and implications of statements rather than solving numerical problems. \n\nHere's a sample question related to Deontic logic:\n\nIf \"X is obligatory\" is true, is it necessarily the case that \"not X is forbidden\"? Why or why not?",
    "message_2": "Yes, if \"X is obligatory\" is true, then it is necessarily the case that \"not X is forbidden.\" This is because, in Deontic logic, obligatory actions are those that must be performed, and their negations (i.e., not performing the action) are considered impermissible or forbidden.\n\nIn Deontic logic, we have three primary modal operators: O (obligatory), P (permissible), and F (forbidden). The relationship between these operators can be expressed as follows:\n\n1. If O(X) is true, then P(~X) is false.\n2. If P(X) is true, then F(X) is false.\n3. If F(X) is true, then P(X) is false.\n\nGiven that \"X is obligatory\" is true (O(X) is true), we can infer from rule 1 that P(~X) is false, meaning that \"not X is permissible\" is false. Since \"not X is permissible\" is false, we can infer from rule 2 that F(~X) is true, which means \"not X is forbidden\" is true. Therefore, if \"X is obligatory\" is true, it is necessarily the case that \"not X is forbidden.\""
