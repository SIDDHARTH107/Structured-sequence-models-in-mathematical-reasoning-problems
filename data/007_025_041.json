    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to know Alice's private key (a) and Bob's private key (b). However, these values are not provided in the problem statement. \n\nIf we assume that Alice's private key (a) and Bob's private key (b) are known, then the shared secret key can be calculated as follows:\n\nShared Secret Key = (Alice's Public Key ^ b) % 11 = (Bob's Public Key ^ a) % 11\n\nHowever, without knowing the values of a and b, we cannot determine the shared secret key."
