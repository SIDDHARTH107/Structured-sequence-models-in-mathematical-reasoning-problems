    "message_2": "To encrypt a message using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the message into a point on the elliptic curve.\n2. Generate a random integer k.\n3. Calculate the ciphertext points C1 and C2.\n\nLet's start with step 1: Convert the message \"Hello\" into a point on the elliptic curve.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the message into a number. We can use ASCII values for this purpose. The ASCII values for \"Hello\" are:\n\nH - 72\ne - 101\nl - 108\nl - 108\no - 111\n\nWe can concatenate these values to get a single number: 72101108108111. However, this number is too large to be used directly as a point on the elliptic curve. We can instead use a hash function to map the message to a smaller number. For simplicity, let's use the modulo operation with the prime number 23. \n\nM = 72101108108111 mod 23 = 9\n\nNow we need to find a point on the elliptic curve with x-coordinate equal to 9. We can do this by plugging x = 9 into the equation of the elliptic curve and solving for y:\n\ny^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7 (mod 23)\n\ny^2 = 9^3 + 5*9 + 7 (mod 23)\n\ny^2 = 729 + 45 + 7 (mod 23)\n\ny^2 = 781 (mod 23)\n\ny^2 = 5 (mod 23)\n\nThe possible values for y are 7 and 16, since 7^2 = 49 (mod 23) = 5 and 16^2 = 256 (mod 23) = 5. We can choose either point, so let's choose the point M = (9, 7).\n\nStep 2: Generate a random integer k.\n\nLet's choose a random integer k between 1 and 22 (since 23 is our prime number). For this example, let's choose k = 6.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the ciphertext points C1 and C2.\n\nC1 = k * P\nC2 = M + k * Q\n\nFirst, we need to calculate 6P and 6Q. We can use the double-and-add method for point multiplication:\n\n2P = (7, 3)\n4P = (12, 17)\n6P = (20, 20)\n\n2Q = (14, 3)\n4Q = (19, 20)\n6Q = (8, 7)\n\nNow we can calculate C1 and C2:\n\nC1 = 6P = (20, 20)\nC2 = M + 6Q = (9, 7) + (8, 7)\n\nTo add the points (9, 7) and (8, 7), we use the point addition formula for elliptic curves:\n\nλ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) (mod 23)\n\nλ = (7 - 7) / (8 - 9) (mod 23)\n\nλ = 0 / (-1) (mod 23)\n\nλ = 0 (mod 23)\n\nx3 = λ^2 - x1 - x2 (mod 23)\n\nx3 = 0^2 - 9 - 8 (mod 23)\n\nx3 = -17 (mod 23)\n\nx3 = 6 (mod 23)\n\ny3 = λ(x1 - x3) - y1 (mod 23)\n\ny3 = 0(9 - 6) - 7 (mod 23)\n\ny3 = -7 (mod 23)\n\ny3 = 16 (mod 23)\n\nSo, C2 = (6, 16).\n\nThe encrypted message is the pair of points (C1, C2) = ((20, 20), (6, 16))."
