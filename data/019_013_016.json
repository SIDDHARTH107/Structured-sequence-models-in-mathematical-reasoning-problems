    "message_2": "A second-order property is a property that applies to subsets of a given set. In this case, we are considering the set X = {1, 2, 3}. To determine the number of second-order properties that can be defined on this set, we first need to find all possible subsets of X.\n\nThe subsets of X are:\n1. {}\n2. {1}\n3. {2}\n4. {3}\n5. {1, 2}\n6. {1, 3}\n7. {2, 3}\n8. {1, 2, 3}\n\nThere are 8 subsets in total, including the empty set and the set X itself. Now, for each subset, a second-order property can either hold or not hold. This means that there are 2^8 = 256 possible combinations of second-order properties that can be defined on the set X."
