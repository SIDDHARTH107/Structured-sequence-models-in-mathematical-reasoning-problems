    "message_2": "To find the frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of the individual sinusoidal components in the signal f(t) = sin(2πt) + sin(4πt) + sin(6πt), we can use the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of a continuous function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1). In this case, f(t) is already given as a sum of sinusoidal functions, so we can directly identify the frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of the individual components.\n\n1. First component: sin(2πt)\n- Frequency: The angular frequency is 2π, so the frequency is ω/(2π) = 1 Hz.\n- Amplitude: The coefficient of the sine function is 1, so the amplitude is 1.\n- Phase: There is no phase shift in the sine function, so the phase is 0.\n\n2. Second component: sin(4πt)\n- Frequency: The angular frequency is 4π, so the frequency is ω/(2π) = 2 Hz.\n- Amplitude: The coefficient of the sine function is 1, so the amplitude is 1.\n- Phase: There is no phase shift in the sine function, so the phase is 0.\n\n3. Third component: sin(6πt)\n- Frequency: The angular frequency is 6π, so the frequency is ω/(2π) = 3 Hz.\n- Amplitude: The coefficient of the sine function is 1, so the amplitude is 1.\n- Phase: There is no phase shift in the sine function, so the phase is 0.\n\nIn summary, the signal f(t) consists of three sinusoidal components with frequencies of 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 3 Hz, all with amplitudes of 1 and phases of 0."
