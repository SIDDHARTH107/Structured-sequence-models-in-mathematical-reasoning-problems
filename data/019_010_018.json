    "message_2": "To prove that ((P⊸Q)⊸(Q⊸R))⊸(P⊸R) is a valid formula in linear logic, we will use the sequent calculus for linear logic. We will show that the sequent ⊢ ((P⊸Q)⊸(Q⊸R))⊸(P⊸R) is provable.\n\nRecall that in linear logic, the ⊸ (linear implication) connective is defined as A⊸B = !A -o B, where !A is the exponential modality (of course) and -o is the linear implication. We will use the following rules for the sequent calculus:\n\n1. Axiom rule: A ⊢ A\n2. Cut rule: If Γ ⊢ A and Δ, A ⊢ B, then Γ, Δ ⊢ B\n3. Linear implication introduction: If Γ, A ⊢ B, then Γ ⊢ A⊸B\n4. Linear implication elimination: If Γ ⊢ A⊸B and Δ ⊢ A, then Γ, Δ ⊢ B\n5. Exponential modality introduction: If Γ ⊢ A, then Γ ⊢ !A\n6. Exponential modality elimination: If Γ, A ⊢ B, then Γ, !A ⊢ B\n\nNow, let's prove the sequent ⊢ ((P⊸Q)⊸(Q⊸R))⊸(P⊸R):\n\n1. ⊢ P⊸Q (axiom rule)\n2. ⊢ Q⊸R (axiom rule)\n3. P⊸Q, Q ⊢ R (linear implication elimination on 2)\n4. P⊸Q, Q⊸R ⊢ R (cut rule on 1 and 3)\n5. P⊸Q ⊢ Q⊸R⊸R (linear implication introduction on 4)\n6. ⊢ (P⊸Q)⊸(Q⊸R)⊸R (linear implication introduction on 5)\n7. ⊢ P⊸R (cut rule on 6 and 2)\n8. ⊢ ((P⊸Q)⊸(Q⊸R))⊸(P⊸R) (linear implication introduction on 7)\n\nThus, we have shown that ((P⊸Q)⊸(Q⊸R))⊸(P⊸R) is a valid formula in linear logic."
