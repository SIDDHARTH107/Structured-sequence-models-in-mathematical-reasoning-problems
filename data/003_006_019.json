    "message_2": "We are given a triangle ABC with angle A = 50°, angle B = 70°, and side a = 8 cm. We can find angle C using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°:\n\nAngle C = 180° - (angle A + angle B) = 180° - (50° + 70°) = 180° - 120° = 60°\n\nNow we can use the law of sines to find the lengths of sides b and c. The law of sines states that:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe already know a, A, B, and C, so we can find b and c using the following equations:\n\nb / sin(70°) = 8 / sin(50°)\nc / sin(60°) = 8 / sin(50°)\n\nNow we can solve for b and c:\n\nb = (8 / sin(50°)) * sin(70°)\nc = (8 / sin(50°)) * sin(60°)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the sine values and perform the calculations:\n\nb ≈ (8 / 0.766) * 0.940 ≈ 9.85 cm\nc ≈ (8 / 0.766) * 0.866 ≈ 9.01 cm\n\nSo, the length of side b is approximately 9.85 cm, and the length of side c is approximately 9.01 cm."
