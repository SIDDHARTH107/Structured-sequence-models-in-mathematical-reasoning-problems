    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Polya's Enumeration Theorem, we need to find the cycle index of the dihedral group D_12 acting on the 12 beads. The cycle index of a group is a polynomial that encodes the group's structure and can be used to count the number of distinct colorings of an object under the group's action.\n\nThe dihedral group D_12 has 12 elements: 6 rotations and 6 reflections. Let's find the cycle structure of each element:\n\n1. Identity (no rotation): 12 cycles of length 1. Cycle structure: (a_1)^12\n2. Rotation by 1/6: 1 cycle of length 12. Cycle structure: (a_12)\n3. Rotation by 1/3: 2 cycles of length 6. Cycle structure: (a_6)^2\n4. Rotation by 1/2: 3 cycles of length 4. Cycle structure: (a_4)^3\n5. Rotation by 2/3: 2 cycles of length 6. Cycle structure: (a_6)^2\n6. Rotation by 5/6: 1 cycle of length 12. Cycle structure: (a_12)\n7-12. Reflections: 6 cycles of length 2. Cycle structure: (a_2)^6\n\nNow, we can compute the cycle index of D_12:\n\nP(D_12) = (1/12)[(a_1)^12 + 2(a_12) + 2(a_6)^2 + (a_4)^3 + 6(a_2)^6]\n\nWe want to count the number of distinct bracelets using 6 red and 6 blue beads. We can substitute a_i with x^i + y^i, where x and y represent the number of red and blue beads, respectively:\n\nP(D_12)(x, y) = (1/12)[(x+y)^12 + 2(x^12+y^12) + 2(x^6+y^6)^2 + (x^4+y^4)^3 + 6(x^2+y^2)^6]\n\nNow, we can expand and collect terms:\n\nP(D_12)(x, y) = (1/12)[924x^6y^6 + 660x^6y^6 + 132x^6y^6 + 36x^6y^6]\n\nAdding the coefficients:\n\nP(D_12)(x, y) = (1/12)[1752x^6y^6]\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the polynomial with x = y = 1 (since we have 6 red and 6 blue beads):\n\nP(D_12)(1, 1) = (1/12)[1752] = 146\n\nSo, there are 146 distinct bracelets that can be formed using 6 identical red beads and 6 identical blue beads."
