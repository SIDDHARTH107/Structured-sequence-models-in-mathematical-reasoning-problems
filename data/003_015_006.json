    "message_2": "To write an equation for the position of the spring as a function of time, we can use the formula for simple harmonic motion:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the position of the spring at time t, A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nIn this case, the spring is stretched 0.2 meters from its natural length, so the amplitude A is 0.2 meters. Since the spring is released from rest, the initial velocity is 0, and the phase angle φ is 0. To find the angular frequency ω, we can use the formula:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the force constant of the spring (100 N/m) and m is the mass attached to the spring. However, we are not given the mass in this problem. Since we are only asked for the position equation, period, and amplitude, we can write the position equation in terms of ω:\n\nx(t) = 0.2 * cos(ωt)\n\nThe period T of the motion is related to the angular frequency by:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nSince we don't have the mass, we cannot find the exact value of the period. However, we can express the period in terms of ω:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nThe amplitude of the motion is 0.2 meters, as given in the problem.\n\nIn summary, the position equation for the spring as a function of time is:\n\nx(t) = 0.2 * cos(ωt)\n\nThe amplitude is 0.2 meters, and the period is T = 2π/ω, where ω = √(k/m)."
