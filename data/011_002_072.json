    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose a group of 5 students from a class of 30, we use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (30 in this case), k is the number of students we want to choose (5), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(30, 5) = 30! / (5!(30-5)!)\n\nC(30, 5) = 30! / (5!25!)\n\nC(30, 5) = (30 × 29 × 28 × 27 × 26 × 25!)/(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 × 25!)\n\nThe 25! in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out:\n\nC(30, 5) = (30 × 29 × 28 × 27 × 26)/(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nC(30, 5) = (30 × 29 × 28 × 27 × 26)/(120)\n\nC(30, 5) = 142506\n\nSo, there are 142,506 ways to choose a group of 5 students from a class of 30."
