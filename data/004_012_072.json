    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 + x) / (5x - 1), we will use the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that if we have a function f(x) = g(x) / h(x), then the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\n\nIn this case, g(x) = 3x^2 + x and h(x) = 5x - 1. First, we need to find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x) with respect to x:\n\ng'(x) = d(3x^2 + x)/dx = 6x + 1\nh'(x) = d(5x - 1)/dx = 5\n\nNow, we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\nf'(x) = ((6x + 1)(5x - 1) - (3x^2 + x)(5)) / (5x - 1)^2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of the function when x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = ((6(2) + 1)(5(2) - 1) - (3(2)^2 + 2)(5)) / (5(2) - 1)^2\nf'(2) = ((12 + 1)(10 - 1) - (12 + 2)(5)) / (10 - 1)^2\nf'(2) = (13(9) - 14(5)) / 9^2\nf'(2) = (117 - 70) / 81\nf'(2) = 47 / 81\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (3x^2 + x) / (5x - 1) when x = 2 is 47/81."
