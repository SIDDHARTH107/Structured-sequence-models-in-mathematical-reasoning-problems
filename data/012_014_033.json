    "message_2": "To determine if two graphs A and B are isomorphic, we need to check if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the adjacency between the vertices is preserved.\n\nHowever, in this case, we can quickly conclude that A and B are not isomorphic because they have a different number of edges. Graph A has 9 edges, while graph B has 8 edges. Since the number of edges is not the same, there cannot be an isomorphism between these two graphs."
