    "message_2": "Calculating the Lyapunov exponent for a weather system is a complex task that requires the use of numerical simulations and models. The Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the sensitivity of a dynamical system to initial conditions, and in the context of weather systems, it is used to quantify the predictability of the system.\n\nTo calculate the Lyapunov exponent for the given initial conditions, one would need to use a numerical weather prediction model that takes into account various factors such as temperature, pressure, wind speed, humidity, and cloud cover. The model would then be run with slightly perturbed initial conditions to determine the rate at which the system diverges from the original trajectory.\n\nSince this task requires specialized software and expertise in atmospheric science, it is not possible to provide a specific value for the Lyapunov exponent in this context. However, it is important to note that weather systems are generally considered to be chaotic, meaning that they have positive Lyapunov exponents and are sensitive to initial conditions. This is why weather forecasts become less accurate as the prediction time increases."
