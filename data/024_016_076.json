    "message_2": "To compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$, we first need to recall the definition of the Levi-Civita connection associated with the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. In this case, the connection coefficients (Christoffel symbols) are all zero, since the Euclidean metric is flat.\n\nNow, let's compute the covariant derivative of $T$ component-wise. The tensor field $T$ has components $T^{ij}$, where $i$ and $j$ are indices ranging from 1 to 3. The covariant derivative of $T$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\nabla_k T^{ij} = \\frac{\\partial T^{ij}}{\\partial x^k} + \\Gamma^i_{mk} T^{mj} + \\Gamma^j_{nk} T^{in}\n$$\n\nSince the Christoffel symbols are all zero, this simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\nabla_k T^{ij} = \\frac{\\partial T^{ij}}{\\partial x^k}\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the partial derivatives of the components of $T$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T^{12}}{\\partial x^1} = 2x, \\quad \\frac{\\partial T^{12}}{\\partial x^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial T^{12}}{\\partial x^3} = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T^{23}}{\\partial x^1} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial T^{23}}{\\partial x^2} = e^y, \\quad \\frac{\\partial T^{23}}{\\partial x^3} = 0\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T^{13}}{\\partial x^1} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial T^{13}}{\\partial x^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial T^{13}}{\\partial x^3} = 3z^2\n$$\n\nAll other components of $T$ are zero. Therefore, the covariant derivative of $T$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\nabla T = 2x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^1} \\otimes dx \\otimes dy + e^y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^2} \\otimes dy \\otimes dz + 3z^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^3} \\otimes dx \\otimes dz\n$$"
