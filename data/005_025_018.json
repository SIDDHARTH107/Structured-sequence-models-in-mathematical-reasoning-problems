    "message_1": "Suppose the heights of a certain population of women are normally distributed with a mean of 65 inches and a standard deviation of 2 inches. If a random sample of 36 women is taken from this population, what is the probability that the sample's average height is greater than 66 inches?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 65 inches, the population standard deviation (σ) is 2 inches, and the sample size (n) is 36.\n\nFirst, let's find the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\nσ_sample_mean = 2 / √36\nσ_sample_mean = 2 / 6\nσ_sample_mean = 1/3 inches\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean is greater than 66 inches. To do this, we will calculate the z-score corresponding to 66 inches in the sampling distribution of the sample mean:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ_sample_mean\nz = (66 - 65) / (1/3)\nz = 1 / (1/3)\nz = 3\n\nNow, we will use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 3. \n\nP(Z > 3) ≈ 0.0013\n\nSo, the probability that the sample's average height is greater than 66 inches is approximately 0.0013 or 0.13%."
