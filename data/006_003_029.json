    "message_1": "A standard deck of cards consists of 52 cards. What is the probability of drawing a heart or a diamond ace from the deck of cards?",
    "message_2": "There are 13 cards of each suit in a standard deck of cards. Since there are 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades), there are 13 hearts and 1 diamond ace in the deck.\n\nSo, there are a total of 13 (hearts) + 1 (diamond ace) = 14 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe probability of drawing a heart or a diamond ace is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 14 / 52\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability = 7 / 26\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a heart or a diamond ace from a standard deck of cards is 7/26."
