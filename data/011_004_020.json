    "message_2": "To form a committee with the given requirements, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen.\n\nFor the men, we have 8 men and need to choose 3. So, C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = 56 ways.\n\nFor the women, we have 5 women and need to choose 2. So, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 5! / (2!3!) = 10 ways.\n\nFor the non-binary people, we have 2 non-binary people and need to choose 1. So, C(2, 1) = 2! / (1!(2-1)!) = 2! / (1!1!) = 2 ways.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways for each gender to get the total number of ways to form the committee:\n\nTotal ways = (ways to choose men) × (ways to choose women) × (ways to choose non-binary people) = 56 × 10 × 2 = 1120 ways.\n\nSo, there are 1120 ways to form the committee with the given requirements."
