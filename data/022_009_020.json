    "message_2": "To find the power series representation of the function f(z) = (z+1)/(z-3) centered at z=2, we will first rewrite the function in a form that allows us to use geometric series.\n\nLet w = z - 2, so z = w + 2. Then, the function becomes:\n\nf(w) = ((w+2)+1)/((w+2)-3) = (w+3)/(w-1)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as a geometric series:\n\nf(w) = (w+3)/(w-1) = (w+3)(1/(w-1)) = (w+3)(1 - w + w^2 - w^3 + ...)\n\nNow, we have the power series representation:\n\nf(w) = (w+3) - (w+3)w + (w+3)w^2 - (w+3)w^3 + ...\n\nTo find the radius of convergence, we will use the Ratio Test. Let a_n be the coefficient of w^n in the power series:\n\na_n = (w+3)(-1)^n\n\nThe Ratio Test states that the radius of convergence R is given by:\n\nR = lim (n -> ∞) |a_n / a_(n+1)|\n\nR = lim (n -> ∞) |((-1)^n (w+3)) / ((-1)^(n+1) (w+3))|\n\nR = lim (n -> ∞) |-1|\n\nR = 1\n\nSo, the radius of convergence is 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the interval of convergence. Since the radius of convergence is 1, the interval of convergence in terms of w is:\n\n-1 < w < 1\n\nRecall that w = z - 2, so we can rewrite the interval of convergence in terms of z:\n\n-1 < z - 2 < 1\n\n1 < z < 3\n\nThus, the interval of convergence for the power series representation of the function f(z) = (z+1)/(z-3) centered at z=2 is 1 < z < 3."
