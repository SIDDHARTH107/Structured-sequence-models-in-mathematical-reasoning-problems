    "message_2": "To find the average number of burglaries per day, you can multiply the probability of a burglary occurring by the total number of houses in the neighborhood.\n\nAverage burglaries per day = Probability of burglary * Total number of houses\nAverage burglaries per day = 0.15 * 300\nAverage burglaries per day = 45\n\nSo, on average, you would expect 45 burglaries to occur in the neighborhood every day."
