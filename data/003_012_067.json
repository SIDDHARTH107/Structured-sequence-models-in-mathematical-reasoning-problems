    "message_1": "The top of a lighthouse is 120 meters above the surface of the sea. A ship is sailing towards the lighthouse at a distance of 250 meters from it. At what angle of depression should the ship's captain look to spot the top of the lighthouse?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of depression, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the side opposite the angle is the height of the lighthouse (120 meters), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance between the ship and the lighthouse (250 meters).\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(angle) = 120 / 250\n\nTo find the angle, we can use the inverse tangent function (also called arctangent or tan^-1):\n\nangle = arctan(120 / 250)\n\nangle â‰ˆ 25.8 degrees\n\nTherefore, the ship's captain should look at an angle of depression of approximately 25.8 degrees to spot the top of the lighthouse."
