    "message_2": "Let X be a smooth projective Fano variety of dimension n with Picard number 1 and Pic(X) = ℤ[H], where H is the ample class of a hyperplane section. If the degree of X is d = Hⁿ, we want to show that X is isomorphic to the complete intersection of n hypersurfaces of degree H.\n\nSince X is a Fano variety, the anticanonical divisor -K_X is ample. We have that -K_X = rH for some positive integer r. By the adjunction formula, we have:\n\nK_X = (K_P + X)|_X,\n\nwhere P is the projective space containing X and K_P is the canonical divisor of P. Since X is a Fano variety, we have -K_X = rH, and thus:\n\n-K_P - X = rH.\n\nNow, we know that K_P = -(n+1)H, so:\n\n-(n+1)H - X = rH.\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nX = (n+1-r)H.\n\nNow, let's compute the degree of X:\n\nd = Hⁿ = ((n+1-r)H)ⁿ.\n\nSince X is a complete intersection of n hypersurfaces, we can write:\n\nd = (deg F_1) * (deg F_2) * ... * (deg F_n),\n\nwhere F_i are the hypersurfaces defining X. Since each hypersurface has degree H, we have:\n\nd = H^n = H * H * ... * H (n times).\n\nComparing the two expressions for d, we have:\n\n((n+1-r)H)ⁿ = H * H * ... * H (n times).\n\nThis implies that each hypersurface has degree H, and X is indeed isomorphic to the complete intersection of n hypersurfaces of degree H.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n=3 and d=5. We have:\n\n5 = H^3.\n\nSince H is an integer, the only possibility is H=1. Therefore, X is the complete intersection of 3 hypersurfaces of degree 1. Thus, 3 hypersurfaces will be required to define X when n=3 and d=5."
