    "message_2": "To find the total geodesic curvature of the boundary, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a compact surface with boundary, the following equation holds:\n\n∫∫_M K dA + ∫_∂M k_g ds = 2πχ(M)\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, k_g is the geodesic curvature, M is the surface, ∂M is the boundary of the surface, dA is the area element, ds is the arc length element, and χ(M) is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nSince the Gaussian curvature is constant and equal to -2, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(-2) * Area(M) + ∫_∂M k_g ds = 2πχ(M)\n\nWe are given that the boundary is a circle of radius 5. The area of the surface enclosed by the boundary can be found using the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nArea(M) = πr^2 = π(5)^2 = 25π\n\nNow, we need to find the Euler characteristic χ(M) of the surface. Since the surface is a disk (simply connected and has a boundary), its Euler characteristic is 1:\n\nχ(M) = 1\n\nNow we can plug these values into the Gauss-Bonnet theorem:\n\n(-2) * (25π) + ∫_∂M k_g ds = 2π(1)\n\nSolving for the integral of the geodesic curvature, we get:\n\n∫_∂M k_g ds = 2π + 50π = 52π\n\nSo, the total geodesic curvature of the boundary is 52π."
