Determine the number of possible partitions for each prime factor:\n\nFor 2^4, the partitions are:\n- (4) - one group of order 16\n- (3, 1) - one group of order 8 and one group of order 2\n- (2, 2) - two groups of order 4\n- (2, 1, 1) - one group of order 4 and two groups of order 2\n\nFor 3^1, the partition is:\n- (1) - one group of order 3\n\n3. Determine the number of groups for each partition:\n\nFor 2^4:\n- (4): There are 14 groups of order 16.\n- (3, 1): There are 5 groups of order 8 and 1 group of order 2. So, there are 5 possibilities.\n- (2, 2): There are 2 groups of order 4. So, there are 1 possibility.\n- (2, 1, 1): There are 2 groups of order 4 and 1 group of order 2. So, there are 2 possibilities.\n\nFor 3^1:\n- (1): There is 1 group of order 3.\n\n4. Combine the possibilities for each prime factor:\n\n- 14 groups of order 16 and 1 group of order 3: 14 possibilities\n- 5 groups of order 8, 1 group of order 2, and 1 group of order 3: 5 possibilities\n- 1 group of order 4, 1 group of order 4, and 1 group of order 3: 1 possibility\n- 2 groups of order 4, 1 group of order 2, and 1 group of order 3: 2 possibilities\n\n5. Add up the possibilities: 14 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 22\n\nThere are 22 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
