    "message_2": "To prove that B is a subset of A, we need to show that every element in B is also an element in A. In other words, if x is an element of B, then x must also be an element of A. This can be written as:\n\n∀x (x ∈ B → x ∈ A)\n\nSince B is the empty set, it has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in B that are not in A. In this case, the statement \"x ∈ B → x ∈ A\" is vacuously true, as there are no elements in B to contradict the statement.\n\nThus, B is a subset of A."
