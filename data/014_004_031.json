    "message_2": "To find the public key in elliptic curve cryptography, we need to perform scalar multiplication of the base point (G) by the private key (n). In this case, G = (2, 2) and n = 759.\n\nThe elliptic curve is defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + 4x + 4 over GF(29). Scalar multiplication involves repeatedly adding the base point to itself, modulo the field size (29 in this case).\n\nWe can use the double-and-add algorithm to perform scalar multiplication efficiently:\n\n1. Convert the private key (759) to its binary representation: 1011110111.\n2. Initialize the result (R) to the point at infinity (O).\n3. Iterate through the binary representation of the private key from left to right:\n   a. Double the current value of R (i.e., perform point addition of R with itself).\n   b. If the current bit is 1, add the base point G to the current value of R.\n\nAfter iterating through all the bits, the final value of R will be the public key.\n\nPerforming these calculations, we get the public key as (28, 6) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 4x + 4 over GF(29)."
