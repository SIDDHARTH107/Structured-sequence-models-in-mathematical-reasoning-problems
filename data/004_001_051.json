    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x - 1, we will apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nSo, let's find the derivative of each term in the function:\n\n1. The derivative of 3x^4:\n   Using the power rule, we have f'(x) = 4 * 3x^(4-1) = 12x^3.\n\n2. The derivative of -2x^3:\n   Using the power rule, we have f'(x) = 3 * (-2)x^(3-1) = -6x^2.\n\n3. The derivative of 5x:\n   Using the power rule, we have f'(x) = 1 * 5x^(1-1) = 5.\n\n4. The derivative of -1 (constant term):\n   The derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, let's combine the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 5\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 12(2)^3 - 6(2)^2 + 5\nf'(2) = 12(8) - 6(4) + 5\nf'(2) = 96 - 24 + 5\nf'(2) = 77\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x - 1 at x = 2 is 77."
