    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can notice that the third equation is a multiple of the first equation (3*(x + 2y + 3z) = 3*(6)). This means that these two equations are dependent, and we can eliminate the third equation from the system.\n\nNow we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n1) x + 2y + 3z = 6\n2) 2x + 3y + z = 3\n\nNext, we can eliminate one of the variables from the remaining two equations. Let's eliminate x. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the second equation:\n\n-2*(x + 2y + 3z) = -2*6\n-2x - 4y - 6z = -12\n\nNow, add this equation to the second equation:\n\n(-2x - 4y - 6z) + (2x + 3y + z) = -12 + 3\n(-2x + 2x) + (-4y + 3y) + (-6z + z) = -9\n-y - 5z = -9\n\nNow we have a simpler equation:\n\n3) -y - 5z = -9\n\nNow, let's express y in terms of z from equation 3:\n\ny = -5z + 9\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into equation 1:\n\nx + 2(-5z + 9) + 3z = 6\nx - 10z + 18 + 3z = 6\nx - 7z = -12\n\nNow express x in terms of z:\n\nx = 7z - 12\n\nNow we have expressions for x and y in terms of z:\n\nx = 7z - 12\ny = -5z + 9\n\nSince there are infinitely many solutions for z, there is no unique solution for x, y, and z. The system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, and they can be expressed in terms of z:\n\nx = 7z - 12\ny = -5z + 9\nz = z"
