    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y''(x) = 4y(x) with initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 2, we first find the general solution of the differential equation.\n\nThe given differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. We can solve it by assuming a solution of the form y(x) = e^(rx), where r is a constant to be determined.\n\nSubstituting this assumed solution into the differential equation, we get:\n\n(e^(rx))'' = 4(e^(rx))\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives of e^(rx) with respect to x, we have:\n\ny'(x) = r * e^(rx)\ny''(x) = r^2 * e^(rx)\n\nNow, substituting these derivatives back into the differential equation:\n\nr^2 * e^(rx) = 4 * e^(rx)\n\nDividing both sides by e^(rx) (since e^(rx) is never zero):\n\nr^2 = 4\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nr = ±2\n\nSo we have two linearly independent solutions: e^(2x) and e^(-2x). The general solution of the differential equation is a linear combination of these two solutions:\n\ny(x) = A * e^(2x) + B * e^(-2x)\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions to find the constants A and B:\n\n1) y(0) = 0:\n0 = A * e^(0) + B * e^(0)\n0 = A + B\n\n2) y'(0) = 2:\nTo find y'(x), we differentiate y(x) with respect to x:\n\ny'(x) = 2A * e^(2x) - 2B * e^(-2x)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition y'(0) = 2:\n\n2 = 2A * e^(0) - 2B * e^(0)\n2 = 2A - 2B\n\nFrom the first initial condition, we have A = -B. Substituting this into the second initial condition equation:\n\n2 = 2(-B) - 2B\n2 = -4B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSince A = -B, we have:\n\nA = 1/2\n\nNow we have the particular solution:\n\ny(x) = (1/2) * e^(2x) - (1/2) * e^(-2x)\n\nFinally, we find the solution at x = 1:\n\ny(1) = (1/2) * e^(2) - (1/2) * e^(-2)\n\ny(1) ≈ 3.194528049465325"
