    "message_1": "Suppose we have two prime numbers, p = 11 and q = 19. Find the modulus (n) by multiplying p and q. Then, calculate the Euler's totient function phi(n) of the modulus by using the formula phi(n) = (p-1) * (q-1). Finally, choose a public exponent e = 7, and calculate its private exponent d using the formula d = e^-1 (mod phi(n)). What is the value of d?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the modulus (n) by multiplying p and q:\n\nn = p * q = 11 * 19 = 209\n\nNext, we'll calculate the Euler's totient function phi(n) using the formula phi(n) = (p-1) * (q-1):\n\nphi(n) = (11-1) * (19-1) = 10 * 18 = 180\n\nNow, we have chosen a public exponent e = 7. To find the private exponent d, we need to use the formula d = e^(-1) (mod phi(n)). In other words, we need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of e (mod phi(n)).\n\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse:\n\ne = 7\nphi(n) = 180\n\nApplying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n1. 180 = 7 * 25 + 5\n2. 7 = 5 * 1 + 2\n3. 5 = 2 * 2 + 1\n\nNow, we'll substitute back:\n\n1. 1 = 5 - 2 * 2\n2. 1 = 5 - 2 * (7 - 5 * 1)\n3. 1 = 5 - 2 * 7 + 2 * 5\n4. 1 = 3 * 5 - 2 * 7\n\nNow, we can see that the modular multiplicative inverse of e (mod phi(n)) is -2. However, we need a positive value for d, so we'll add phi(n) to the result:\n\nd = -2 + 180 = 178\n\nSo, the private exponent d is 178."
