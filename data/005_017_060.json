    "message_1": "The scores of 100 students in a mathematics test were recorded. The mean score was 70 and the standard deviation was 10. Use Principal Component Analysis to find the first principal component and its corresponding principal component score for these data.",
    "message_2": "To perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the given data, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Standardize the data\n2. Calculate the covariance matrix\n3. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix\n4. Choose the first principal component based on the largest eigenvalue\n\nHowever, in this case, we only have the mean and standard deviation of the scores, and not the actual data points. Therefore, we cannot perform PCA directly on this information.\n\nPCA is a technique used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction in datasets with multiple variables. Since we only have one variable (the test scores) in this problem, PCA is not applicable.\n\nIf you have more information about the dataset or additional variables, please provide them so we can perform PCA accordingly."
