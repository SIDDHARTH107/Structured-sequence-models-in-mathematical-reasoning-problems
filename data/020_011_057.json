    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products A and B. The company has limited resources and can only produce up to 1000 units of A and 2000 units of B per week. The profit earned from each unit of A is $10 and from each unit of B is $15. The company wants to maximize the total weekly profit. What is the optimal production quantity of A and B to maximize the weekly profit for the company?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. The company's constraints are:\n\nx ≤ 1000 (constraint for product A)\ny ≤ 2000 (constraint for product B)\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nSince the company wants to maximize its profit, it should produce as many units as possible within the given constraints. \n\nFirst, let's consider the constraint for product A:\n\nIf x = 1000, then the profit from product A is 10 * 1000 = $10,000.\n\nNow, let's consider the constraint for product B:\n\nIf y = 2000, then the profit from product B is 15 * 2000 = $30,000.\n\nSo, the total profit when producing the maximum number of units for both products is:\n\nP(1000, 2000) = 10 * 1000 + 15 * 2000 = $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000\n\nTherefore, the optimal production quantity to maximize the weekly profit for the company is to produce 1000 units of product A and 2000 units of product B, resulting in a total weekly profit of $40,000."
