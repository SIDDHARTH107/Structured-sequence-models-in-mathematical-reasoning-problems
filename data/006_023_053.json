    "message_1": "In a market of 500 consumers, the probability of a person buying a product is 0.6. What is the probability that among a group of 10 people randomly selected from the market, 8 will buy the product?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people buying the product) out of n trials (the number of people in the group)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, a person buying the product)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of people in the group)\n- k is the number of successes we want to find the probability for (in this case, 8 people buying the product)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 10 (the number of people in the group)\n- k = 8 (the number of people we want to buy the product)\n- p = 0.6 (the probability of a person buying the product)\n\nNow we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.6^8 * (1-0.6)^(10-8)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(10, 8):\n\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8! * (10-8)!)\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8! * 2!)\nC(10, 8) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\nC(10, 8) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1)\nC(10, 8) = 45\n\nNow we can plug this value back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 8) = 45 * 0.6^8 * (1-0.6)^(10-8)\nP(X = 8) = 45 * 0.6^8 * 0.4^2\n\nNow we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 8) ≈ 45 * 0.01679616 * 0.16\nP(X = 8) ≈ 0.120932352\n\nSo the probability that among a group of 10 people randomly selected from the market, 8 will buy the product is approximately 0.1209 or 12.09%."
