    "message_2": "To show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, we will use the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 35 = 5^1 * 7^1. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, must divide 7 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups, n_7, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is n_7 = 1.\n\nLet P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup and Q be the unique 7-Sylow subgroup. Since P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G (by Sylow's second theorem). Now, we have |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7, and since 5 and 7 are prime, P and Q are cyclic. Let p be a generator of P and q be a generator of Q.\n\nNow, consider the element pq in G. Since P and Q are normal in G, we have:\n\n(pq)^5 = p^5q^5 = (p^5)q^5 = e*q^5 = q^5,\n\nwhere e is the identity element in G. Similarly, (pq)^7 = p^7q^7 = p^7*(q^7) = p^7*e = p^7. Since |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7, we have p^5 = e and q^7 = e. Thus, (pq)^35 = (pq)^{5*7} = (pq)^5)^7 = (q^5)^7 = q^{5*7} = q^{35} = e.\n\nNow, let x be an element in G. Since P and Q are the unique 5-Sylow and 7-Sylow subgroups, x can be written as x = p^a * q^b for some integers a and b with 0 ≤ a < 5 and 0 ≤ b < 7. Then, x^{35} = (p^a * q^b)^{35} = (p^a)^{35} * (q^b)^{35} = p^{35a} * q^{35b} = (p^5)^{7a} * (q^7)^{5b} = e^{7a} * e^{5b} = e.\n\nSince every element in G has order dividing 35, by the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
