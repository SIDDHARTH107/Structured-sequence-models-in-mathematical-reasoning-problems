    "message_2": "The moduli space of smooth algebraic curves of genus g is denoted by M_g. The dimension of this moduli space can be found using the Riemann-Roch theorem and the theory of moduli spaces of curves.\n\nIn general, the dimension of M_g is given by the formula:\n\ndim(M_g) = 3g - 3\n\nFor genus 4, we have:\n\ndim(M_4) = 3(4) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9\n\nSo, the dimension of the moduli space of algebraic curves with genus 4 is 9."
