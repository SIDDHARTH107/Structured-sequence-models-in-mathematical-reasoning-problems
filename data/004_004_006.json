    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed by the curve y = 2x^2, the x-axis, and the lines x = 1 and x = 3, we need to integrate the function y = 2x^2 with respect to x from x = 1 to x = 3.\n\nThe integral of 2x^2 with respect to x is:\n\nâˆ«(2x^2) dx = (2/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this integral from x = 1 to x = 3:\n\nArea = [(2/3)(3^3) - (2/3)(1^3)]\nArea = [(2/3)(27) - (2/3)(1)]\nArea = [(54 - 2)/3]\nArea = 52/3\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the curve, x-axis, and the lines x = 1 and x = 3 is 52/3 square units."
