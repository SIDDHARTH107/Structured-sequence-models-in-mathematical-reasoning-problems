    "message_2": "To divide the group of 10 students into teams of sizes 4, 3, and 3, we can use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of students and k is the number of students in a team.\n\nFirst, we need to choose 4 students out of 10 for the first team. This can be done in C(10, 4) ways.\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!) = 10! / (4!6!) = 210 ways\n\nNow, we have 6 students left. We need to choose 3 students out of 6 for the second team. This can be done in C(6, 3) ways.\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = 20 ways\n\nThe remaining 3 students will automatically form the third team, so we don't need to calculate combinations for that.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to partition the students into 3 teams, we multiply the number of ways for each team:\n\nTotal ways = 210 (first team) * 20 (second team) = 4200 ways\n\nSo, there are 4200 ways to partition the group of 10 students into 3 teams of sizes 4, 3, and 3."
