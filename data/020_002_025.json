The profit of the company from each product is given by:\n\nProfit from product A = 5x^2 - 10x\nProfit from product B = 3y^2 - 6y\n\nwhere x represents the number of units of product A produced and y represents the number of units of product B produced. However, the production capacity of the company is limited to 100 units. Determine the number of units of each product that the company should produce in order to maximize profit.\n\nWhat are the values of x and y that maximize the company's profit, and what is the maximum profit that can be earned?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the values of x and y that maximize the total profit function, subject to the constraint that x + y ≤ 100.\n\nThe total profit function is:\nP(x, y) = 5x^2 - 10x + 3y^2 - 6y\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's introduce a new variable λ (lambda) and form the Lagrangian function:\n\nL(x, y, λ) = 5x^2 - 10x + 3y^2 - 6y + λ(100 - x - y)\n\nNow, we need to find the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂L/∂x = 10x - 10 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂y = 6y - 6 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = 100 - x - y = 0\n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three unknowns:\n\n10x - 10 - λ = 0\n6y - 6 - λ = 0\n100 - x - y = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get two possible solutions:\n\n1) x = 1, y = 99, λ = 0\n2) x = 99, y = 1, λ = 0\n\nNow we need to check which solution gives us the maximum profit:\n\nP(1, 99) = 5(1)^2 - 10(1) + 3(99)^2 - 6(99) = -5 + 3(9801) - 594 = 29,208\nP(99, 1) = 5(99)^2 - 10(99) + 3(1)^2 - 6(1) = 5(9801) - 990 + 3 - 6 = 48,510\n\nThe maximum profit is achieved when x = 99 and y = 1, and the maximum profit is $48,510."
