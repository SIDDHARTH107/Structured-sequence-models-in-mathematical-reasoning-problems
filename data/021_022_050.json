    "message_1": "Here's a problem for the math student to solve:\n\nA company produces two products A and B. The profit per unit for product A is $6 and for product B is $8. The company has limited resources and can produce no more than 800 units of product A and no more than 500 units of product B. The production process for product A requires 4 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time per unit, while production process for product B requires 6 hours of labor and 4 hours of machine time per unit. The company has a total of 2400 hours of labor and 1600 hours of machine time available. Determine the number of units of each product that the company should produce in order to maximize profit using the Firefly Algorithm.",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that is not easily implemented in a text-based environment. However, we can solve this problem using linear programming.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (profit to maximize): P = 6x + 8y\n\nConstraints:\n1. x ≤ 800 (maximum units of product A)\n2. y ≤ 500 (maximum units of product B)\n3. 4x + 6y ≤ 2400 (labor hours constraint)\n4. 3x + 4y ≤ 1600 (machine hours constraint)\n5. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x = 800\n2. y = 500\n3. y = (2400 - 4x) / 6\n4. y = (1600 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow, we'll find the corner points of the feasible region:\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and constraint 3: (800, 200)\n2. Intersection of constraint 1 and constraint 4: (800, 100)\n3. Intersection of constraint 2 and constraint 3: (300, 500)\n4. Intersection of constraint 2 and constraint 4: (200, 500)\n\nNext, we'll evaluate the objective function P at each corner point:\n1. P(800, 200) = 6(800) + 8(200) = 6400\n2. P(800, 100) = 6(800) + 8(100) = 5600\n3. P(300, 500) = 6(300) + 8(500) = 5800\n4. P(200, 500) = 6(200) + 8(500) = 5200\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (800, 200), with a profit of $6400.\n\nSo, the company should produce 800 units of product A and 200 units of product B to maximize its profit."
