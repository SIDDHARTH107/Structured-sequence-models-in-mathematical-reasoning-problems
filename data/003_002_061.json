    "message_2": "To find the values of sin(60°) and cos(45°), we can use the trigonometric ratios for special angles in a right triangle.\n\nFor a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1:√3:2, where the side opposite the 30° angle is 1, the side opposite the 60° angle is √3, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nSo, sin(60°) = opposite side / hypotenuse = √3 / 2.\n\nFor a 45-45-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1:1:√2, where the sides opposite the 45° angles are both 1, and the hypotenuse is √2.\n\nSo, cos(45°) = adjacent side / hypotenuse = 1 / √2. To rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √2, giving us cos(45°) = √2 / 2.\n\nTherefore, sin(60°) = √3 / 2 and cos(45°) = √2 / 2."
