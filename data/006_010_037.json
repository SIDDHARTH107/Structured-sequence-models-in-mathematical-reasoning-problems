    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a sample of 100 individuals from a particular demographic group, 20 will be affected by a disease with a prevalence rate of 15% in that group?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is used to find the probability of a specific number of successes (in this case, individuals affected by the disease) in a fixed number of trials (in this case, the sample of 100 individuals). The formula is:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (x!(n-x)!)) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having x successes (affected individuals) in n trials (sample size)\n- n is the number of trials (sample size)\n- x is the number of successes (affected individuals)\n- p is the probability of success (prevalence rate)\n- ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 100 (sample size)\n- x = 20 (affected individuals)\n- p = 0.15 (prevalence rate)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(20) = (100! / (20!(100-20)!)) * (0.15^20) * (1-0.15)^(100-20)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the factorials:\n- 100! = 9.33262154 × 10^157\n- 20! = 2.432902 × 10^18\n- 80! = 7.1569457 × 10^118\n\nNext, we can calculate the binomial coefficient (n! / (x!(n-x)!)):\n- (100! / (20! * 80!)) = 535983370403809682970\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of having 20 affected individuals in the sample:\n\nP(20) = 535983370403809682970 * (0.15^20) * (0.85^80)\nP(20) ≈ 0.0364\n\nSo, the probability of having 20 affected individuals out of a sample of 100 from a demographic group with a 15% prevalence rate is approximately 3.64%."
