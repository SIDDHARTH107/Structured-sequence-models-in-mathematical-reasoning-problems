    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the QR decomposition method, we first need to represent the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  1  2 |\n    | 2 -1 -1 |\n    | 1  5  4 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10  |\n    | -1  |\n    | 24  |\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A, which means we need to find orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R.\n\n1. Find the orthogonal basis for A:\n\nu1 = a1 = (3, 2, 1)\nu2 = a2 - proj_u1(a2) = (-1, -1, 5) - ((-1, -1, 5)·(3, 2, 1))/((3, 2, 1)·(3, 2, 1)) * (3, 2, 1) = (-1, -1, 5) - (1/14) * (3, 2, 1) = (-3/14, -9/14, 63/14)\nu3 = a3 - proj_u1(a3) - proj_u2(a3) = (2, -1, 4) - ((2, -1, 4)·(3, 2, 1))/((3, 2, 1)·(3, 2, 1)) * (3, 2, 1) - ((2, -1, 4)·(-3/14, -9/14, 63/14))/((-3/14, -9/14, 63/14)·(-3/14, -9/14, 63/14)) * (-3/14, -9/14, 63/14) = (0, -2, 2)\n\n2. Normalize the orthogonal basis to get the orthonormal basis:\n\nq1 = u1/||u1|| = (3, 2, 1)/√14 = (3/√14, 2/√14, 1/√14)\nq2 = u2/||u2|| = (-3/14, -9/14, 63/14)/√(9/14) = (-1/3, -1, 7/3)\nq3 = u3/||u3|| = (0, -2, 2)/2 = (0, -1, 1)\n\n3. Form the orthogonal matrix Q:\n\nQ = | 3/√14 -1/3   0 |\n    | 2/√14 -1    -1 |\n    | 1/√14  7/3   1 |\n\n4. Compute the upper triangular matrix R:\n\nR = Q^T * A\n\nR = | 14/√14  1/√14  10/√14 |\n    | 0       8/3     2/3   |\n    | 0       0       2     |\n\nNow that we have Q and R, we can solve the system RX = Q^T * B.\n\n5. Compute Q^T * B:\n\nQ^T * B = | 10/√14 |\n          |  29/3  |\n          |   2    |\n\n6. Solve the upper triangular system RX = Q^T * B using back-substitution:\n\nR = | 14/√14  1/√14  10/√14 |   X = | x |   Q^T * B = | 10/√14 |\n    | 0       8/3     2/3   |       | y |             |  29/3  |\n    | 0       0       2     |       | z |             |   2    |\n\nFrom the last row of R: 2z = 2 => z = 1\n\nFrom the second row of R: (8/3)y + (2/3) = 29/3 => y = 3\n\nFrom the first row of R: (14/√14)x + (1/√14) + (10/√14) = 10/√14 => x = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 3, and z = 1."
