    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangular piece of land, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: (base * height) / 2.\n\nArea = (60 meters * 80 meters) / 2\nArea = 4800 square meters\n\nNow, to find the maximum value of the land, we can multiply the area by the price per square meter:\n\nValue = Area * Price per square meter\nValue = 4800 square meters * $100 per square meter\nValue = $480,000\n\nThe maximum value of the land is $480,000."
