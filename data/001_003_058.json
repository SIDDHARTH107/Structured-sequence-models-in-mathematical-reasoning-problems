    "message_2": "First, we will solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the first equation for y:\n\ny = 10 - 2x\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\nx - 3(10 - 2x) = -4\n\nNow, we will solve for x:\n\nx - 30 + 6x = -4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n7x - 30 = -4\n\nAdd 30 to both sides:\n\n7x = 26\n\nDivide by 7:\n\nx = 26/7\n\nNow, we will substitute this value of x back into the expression we found for y:\n\ny = 10 - 2(26/7)\n\ny = 10 - 52/7\n\nTo subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 7:\n\ny = 70/7 - 52/7\n\ny = 18/7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 26/7 and y = 18/7."
