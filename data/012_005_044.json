    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two nodes in the graph. To find the diameter, we need to consider the possible connections between the nodes based on their degrees.\n\nLet's start by connecting the nodes with degree 1 to the nodes with higher degrees. We can connect nodes 3, 5, 7, and 10 to node 4, which has the highest degree of 4. This will leave node 4 with no more available connections.\n\nNow, we can connect the remaining nodes:\n\n- Connect node 1 to nodes 2 and 6.\n- Connect node 2 to nodes 8 and 9.\n- Connect node 6 to node 9.\n- Connect node 8 to node 9.\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n```\n  1 - 2 - 8\n  |   |   |\n  6 - 9   4\n      |   |\n      3   5\n      |   |\n      7   10\n```\n\nNow, we can find the longest shortest path between any two nodes in the graph:\n\n- The longest shortest path between nodes 1 and 10 is 5 (1-2-8-4-10).\n- The longest shortest path between nodes 3 and 7 is 4 (3-9-6-1-7).\n\nTherefore, the diameter of this graph G is 5."
