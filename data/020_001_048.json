    "message_1": "A can of soda contains 12 fluid ounces of liquid. The production cost for each can is $0.25. The soda company uses trucks to transport the cans from the production facility to the distributor. One truck can hold a maximum of 2,000 cans, and the transportation cost per truck is $500. If the soda company wants to maximize their profits, how many cans of soda should be transported in each truck? What will be the maximum profit the company can make in a single truckload?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profits, the soda company should transport the maximum number of cans that a truck can hold, which is 2,000 cans.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost and profit for a single truckload:\n\n1. Production cost for 2,000 cans:\n   $0.25 per can * 2,000 cans = $500\n\n2. Transportation cost for one truck:\n   $500\n\n3. Total cost for one truckload:\n   Production cost + Transportation cost = $500 + $500 = $1,000\n\nLet's assume the selling price per can is 'x' dollars. Then, the revenue for 2,000 cans would be 2,000x dollars.\n\n4. Profit for one truckload:\n   Revenue - Total cost = 2,000x - $1,000\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to know the selling price per can (x). However, since the problem does not provide this information, we cannot determine the maximum profit the company can make in a single truckload."
