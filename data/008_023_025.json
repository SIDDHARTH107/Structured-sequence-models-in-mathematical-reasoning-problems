    "message_1": "Consider the following system of equations:\n```\nx + 2y + z = 14\n3x - 2y + 4z = 3\n2x + y - z = 6\n```\nSuppose that due to measurement errors, the third equation should read `2x + y - z = 7` instead of `2x + y - z = 6`. Using methods from linear algebra, find a solution to the corrected system of equations.",
    "message_2": "To solve the corrected system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. The corrected system of equations is:\n\n```\nx + 2y + z = 14\n3x - 2y + 4z = 3\n2x + y - z = 7\n```\n\nFirst, we write the augmented matrix for this system:\n\n```\n| 1  2  1 | 14\n| 3 -2  4 |  3\n| 2  1 -1 |  7\n```\n\nNow, we perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix into its row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 3 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 2 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  2  1 | 14\n| 0 -8  1 | -39\n| 0 -3 -3 | -21\n```\n\n2. Divide the second row by -8:\n\n```\n| 1  2  1 |  14\n| 0  1 -1/8 | 39/8\n| 0 -3 -3  | -21\n```\n\n3. Add 3 times the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  2   1  |  14\n| 0  1 -1/8 | 39/8\n| 0  0 -23/8| -15/8\n```\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the matrix. Next, we perform back-substitution to find the solution:\n\n1. Divide the third row by -23/8:\n\n```\n| 1  2   1  |  14\n| 0  1 -1/8 | 39/8\n| 0  0   1  |  5/3\n```\n\n2. Add 1/8 times the third row to the second row, and subtract the third row from the first row:\n\n```\n| 1  2  0 |  38/3\n| 0  1  0 |  41/3\n| 0  0  1 |   5/3\n```\n\n3. Subtract 2 times the second row from the first row:\n\n```\n| 1  0  0 |  -4/3\n| 0  1  0 |  41/3\n| 0  0  1 |   5/3\n```\n\nThe solution to the corrected system of equations is:\n\nx = -4/3\ny = 41/3\nz = 5/3"
