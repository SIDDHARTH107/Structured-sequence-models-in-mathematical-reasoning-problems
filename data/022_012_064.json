    "message_2": "To find the isolated singularities of f(z), we first need to find the points where the denominator is zero. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^3 - 2z^2 + z = 0\n\nWe can factor out a z:\n\nz(z^2 - 2z + 1) = 0\n\nNow we can see that z = 0 is a root. The quadratic factor (z^2 - 2z + 1) can be factored further as (z - 1)^2. So, the roots are z = 0 and z = 1 (with multiplicity 2).\n\nNow, we need to determine the type of singularities at these points. We can do this by examining the limit of f(z) as z approaches these points.\n\n1. Singularity at z = 0:\n\nSince the numerator does not have a root at z = 0, this singularity is a pole. To find the order of the pole, we can look at the difference in the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The degree of the numerator is 2, and the degree of the denominator is 3. The difference is 1, so the pole at z = 0 is a simple pole (order 1).\n\n2. Singularity at z = 1:\n\nAgain, the numerator does not have a root at z = 1, so this singularity is also a pole. To find the order of the pole, we look at the difference in the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The degree of the numerator is 2, and the degree of the denominator is 3. The difference is 1, but since the root z = 1 has multiplicity 2, the pole at z = 1 is a pole of order 2.\n\nIn conclusion, f(z) has two isolated singularities: a simple pole at z = 0 and a pole of order 2 at z = 1. There are no removable or essential singularities."
