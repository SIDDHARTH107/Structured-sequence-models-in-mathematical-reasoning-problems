    "message_2": "Let A be a set containing 3 elements, say A = {a, b, c}. The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and the set A itself.\n\nP(A) = {∅, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}\n\nThe size of the power set of A, |P(A)|, is the number of elements in P(A). In this case, |P(A)| = 8.\n\nNow let's compare the size of the power set of A to the size of the original set A. The size of the original set A, |A|, is 3 (since it has 3 elements). Therefore, |P(A)| > |A|, as 8 > 3.\n\nTo show that the size of the power set is always greater than the size of the original set, let's consider a set B with n elements. The size of the power set of B, |P(B)|, is given by the formula 2^n (since each element can either be included or excluded from a subset). \n\nSince n ≥ 0, we have 2^n ≥ 1 (as 2^0 = 1). Therefore, 2^n > n for all n ≥ 0. This means that the size of the power set of any set is always greater than the size of the original set."
