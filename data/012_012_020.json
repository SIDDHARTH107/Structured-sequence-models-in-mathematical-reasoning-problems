    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of the graph, we can use the following inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor((m + 1) / (n - girth(G) + 2))\n\nwhere G is the graph, m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices.\n\nIn our case, m = 13 and n = 10. Let's consider the possible girth values and check the inequality:\n\n1. If girth(G) = 3 (a triangle), then:\n\n3 ≤ 2 * floor((13 + 1) / (10 - 3 + 2))\n3 ≤ 2 * floor(14 / 9)\n3 ≤ 2 * 1\n3 ≤ 2\n\nThis inequality is false, so the girth cannot be 3.\n\n2. If girth(G) = 4 (a square), then:\n\n4 ≤ 2 * floor((13 + 1) / (10 - 4 + 2))\n4 ≤ 2 * floor(14 / 8)\n4 ≤ 2 * 1\n4 ≤ 2\n\nThis inequality is also false, so the girth cannot be 4.\n\n3. If girth(G) = 5 (a pentagon), then:\n\n5 ≤ 2 * floor((13 + 1) / (10 - 5 + 2))\n5 ≤ 2 * floor(14 / 7)\n5 ≤ 2 * 2\n5 ≤ 4\n\nThis inequality is false, so the girth cannot be 5.\n\n4. If girth(G) = 6 (a hexagon), then:\n\n6 ≤ 2 * floor((13 + 1) / (10 - 6 + 2))\n6 ≤ 2 * floor(14 / 6)\n6 ≤ 2 * 2\n6 ≤ 4\n\nThis inequality is false, so the girth cannot be 6.\n\nSince the girth cannot be 3, 4, 5, or 6, and a simple graph with 10 vertices and 13 edges cannot have a girth greater than 6, we conclude that the graph has no cycles, and therefore, the girth is undefined."
