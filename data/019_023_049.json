    "message_2": "Using inductive logic and based on the observation that the professor has worn a blue shirt for the past 5 Mondays, we would predict that the professor will wear a blue shirt again on the next Monday. However, it's important to note that inductive logic is not always certain, and there could be other factors influencing the professor's choice of shirt color."
