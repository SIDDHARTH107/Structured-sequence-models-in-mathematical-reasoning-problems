    "message_2": "First, let's find A×B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A×B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA×B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nNow let's find (A×B)×{5}. This is the Cartesian product of the set A×B and the set {5}. \n\n(A×B)×{5} = {((1,3),5), ((1,4),5), ((2,3),5), ((2,4),5)}\n\nNext, let's find B×{5}. This is the Cartesian product of the set B and the set {5}.\n\nB×{5} = {(3,5), (4,5)}\n\nNow let's find A×(B×{5}). This is the Cartesian product of the set A and the set B×{5}.\n\nA×(B×{5}) = {(1,(3,5)), (1,(4,5)), (2,(3,5)), (2,(4,5))}\n\nNow, let's rewrite A×(B×{5}) in the same format as (A×B)×{5}:\n\nA×(B×{5}) = {((1,3),5), ((1,4),5), ((2,3),5), ((2,4),5)}\n\nComparing the two sets, we can see that (A×B)×{5} and A×(B×{5}) are equal:\n\n(A×B)×{5} = A×(B×{5}) = {((1,3),5), ((1,4),5), ((2,3),5), ((2,4),5)}\n\nThis demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two sets is associative."
