The distances between the points (in miles) are as follows: \n\n- A to C: 10 miles\n- C to D: 5 miles\n- D to E: 3 miles\n- E to B: 12 miles\n\nThe company wants to minimize the total distance traveled by the delivery vehicle. What is the optimal route for the vehicle to take from point A to point B, and what is the total distance traveled along the route?",
