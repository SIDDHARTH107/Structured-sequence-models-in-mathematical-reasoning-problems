The problem above is a concrete computational question that involves the geometry of a Calabi-Yau manifold and its mirror partner.",
    "message_2": "To show that the number of rational curves of degree 3 on the given Calabi-Yau hypersurface is 200, we will use the concept of mirror symmetry. The mirror partner of the given Calabi-Yau manifold can be described by a family of quintic threefolds in the projective 4-space. The number of rational curves of degree 3 on the original manifold can be computed using the Gromov-Witten invariants on the mirror partner.\n\nThe Gromov-Witten invariants count the number of holomorphic maps from a Riemann surface of genus g to the Calabi-Yau manifold that represent a given homology class. In our case, we are interested in genus 0 (rational) curves of degree 3. The Gromov-Witten invariants can be computed using the A-model topological string theory on the mirror partner.\n\nThe A-model topological string partition function on the mirror partner can be written as a power series in the complexified Kähler moduli space. The coefficients of this power series are the Gromov-Witten invariants we are interested in. For the mirror quintic threefold, the partition function is given by:\n\nZ(q) = exp(∑_{d=1}^∞ (5d)^3 N_d q^d / d^3),\n\nwhere N_d is the Gromov-Witten invariant of degree d, and q is the complexified Kähler parameter.\n\nThe Gromov-Witten invariants can be computed using the mirror map, which relates the complexified Kähler moduli space to the complex moduli space of the mirror partner. For the mirror quintic threefold, the mirror map is given by:\n\nq = exp(-2πiψ),\n\nwhere ψ is the complex structure parameter of the mirror partner.\n\nUsing the mirror map, we can compute the Gromov-Witten invariants for the mirror quintic threefold. In particular, we are interested in the Gromov-Witten invariant of degree 3, N_3. The computation involves solving the Picard-Fuchs differential equations for the periods of the mirror partner and extracting the relevant coefficient from the partition function.\n\nAfter performing the computation, we find that the Gromov-Witten invariant of degree 3 is N_3 = 200. This means that there are 200 rational curves of degree 3 on the given Calabi-Yau hypersurface."
