    "message_1": "A math student is conducting an experiment to test the effect of two different fertilizers on the growth of tomato plants. He has 6 tomato plants and randomly assigned 3 of them to be treated with Fertilizer A and the other 3 to be treated with Fertilizer B. After 4 weeks, he recorded the height of each plant (in cm). The recorded heights were as follows:\n\nFertilizer A: 35, 40, 42 \n\nFertilizer B: 38, 41, 37 \n\nWhat is the mean height of tomato plants treated with Fertilizer A? What is the mean height of tomato plants treated with Fertilizer B? Which fertilizer resulted in greater mean height of tomato plants?",
    "message_2": "To find the mean height of the tomato plants treated with each fertilizer, we need to add the heights of the plants and then divide by the number of plants.\n\nFor Fertilizer A:\nMean height = (35 + 40 + 42) / 3\nMean height = 117 / 3\nMean height = 39 cm\n\nFor Fertilizer B:\nMean height = (38 + 41 + 37) / 3\nMean height = 116 / 3\nMean height = 38.67 cm (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThe mean height of tomato plants treated with Fertilizer A is 39 cm, and the mean height of tomato plants treated with Fertilizer B is 38.67 cm. Fertilizer A resulted in a greater mean height of tomato plants."
