    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B:\n\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\n\nNow, let's find (A x B) ∩ {1}. Since {1} is a set containing only one element, there are no ordered pairs in (A x B) that have {1} as an element. Therefore, (A x B) ∩ {1} = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product B x A:\n\nB x A = {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nNow, let's find (B x A) ∩ {1}. Similar to the previous case, there are no ordered pairs in (B x A) that have {1} as an element. Therefore, (B x A) ∩ {1} = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nNow, we need to show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection. To do this, we need to show that (A x B) ∩ (B x A) ≠ A x (B ∩ A).\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection of A and B:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product A x (B ∩ A):\n\nA x (B ∩ A) = A x {2, 3} = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A x B) and (B x A):\n\n(A x B) ∩ (B x A) = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)} ∩ {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\n(A x B) ∩ (B x A) = {(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A x B) ∩ (B x A) ≠ A x (B ∩ A) since {(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)} ≠ {(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)}. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to intersection."
