    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular polygon, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (Perimeter × Apothem) / 2\n\nFirst, we need to find the perimeter of the polygon. Since it has 10 sides, each with a length of 8 cm, the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 10 × 8 = 80 cm\n\nNext, we need to find the apothem, which is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of one of its sides. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nApothem = (Side length) / (2 × tan(180° / Number of sides))\n\nIn this case, the side length is 8 cm and the number of sides is 10. So, we have:\n\nApothem = 8 / (2 × tan(180° / 10))\nApothem = 8 / (2 × tan(18°))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that tan(18°) is approximately 0.3249. So, the apothem is:\n\nApothem ≈ 8 / (2 × 0.3249)\nApothem ≈ 12.307 cm\n\nNow, we can find the area of the polygon using the formula:\n\nArea = (Perimeter × Apothem) / 2\nArea ≈ (80 × 12.307) / 2\nArea ≈ 492.28 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the regular polygon with 10 sides and a side length of 8 cm is approximately 492.28 cm²."
