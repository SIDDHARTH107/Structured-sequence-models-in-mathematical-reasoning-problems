    "message_1": "Alice and Bob agree to use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method to establish a secret key. Alice chooses a prime number p = 17 and a base g = 3. Bob chooses a secret number a = 5 and computes g^a (mod p) = 3^5 (mod 17). Alice chooses a secret number b = 10 and computes g^b (mod p) = 3^10 (mod 17).\n\nWhat is the secret key that Alice and Bob can use for their communication?",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute the values of g^a (mod p) and g^b (mod p):\n\ng^a (mod p) = 3^5 (mod 17) = 243 (mod 17) = 4\ng^b (mod p) = 3^10 (mod 17) = 59049 (mod 17) = 16\n\nNow, Alice and Bob exchange these values. Alice receives the value 4, and Bob receives the value 16.\n\nNext, Alice computes the secret key by raising the received value to the power of her secret number b (mod p):\n\nsecret_key_Alice = 4^10 (mod 17) = 1048576 (mod 17) = 1\n\nBob computes the secret key by raising the received value to the power of his secret number a (mod p):\n\nsecret_key_Bob = 16^5 (mod 17) = 1048576 (mod 17) = 1\n\nSince secret_key_Alice and secret_key_Bob are equal, Alice and Bob now share the secret key 1 for their communication."
