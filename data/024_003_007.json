    "message_1": "Consider a surface S obtained by rotating the curve given by y = x^2, (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), about the x-axis. Find the Gaussian curvature of this surface at the point (1, 1).",
    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface S, we first need to parameterize the surface. Let's use the following parameterization:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v*cos(w), v*sin(w)), where 0 ≤ u ≤ 1, 0 ≤ v ≤ u^2, and 0 ≤ w ≤ 2π.\n\nNow, we need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. To do this, we first compute the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and w:\n\nr_u = (∂r/∂u) = (1, 2*u*cos(w), 2*u*sin(w))\nr_w = (∂r/∂w) = (0, -v*sin(w), v*cos(w))\n\nNext, we compute the metric tensor g_ij, which is given by the dot products of the partial derivatives:\n\ng_11 = <r_u, r_u> = 1 + 4*u^2*cos^2(w) + 4*u^2*sin^2(w) = 1 + 4*u^2\ng_12 = g_21 = <r_u, r_w> = -2*u*v*sin(w)*cos(w) + 2*u*v*sin(w)*cos(w) = 0\ng_22 = <r_w, r_w> = v^2*sin^2(w) + v^2*cos^2(w) = v^2\n\nNow, we compute the normal vector N to the surface:\n\nN = r_u × r_w = (2*u*v*cos(w), -v*(1 + 4*u^2)*sin(w), v*(1 + 4*u^2)*cos(w))\n\nWe normalize the normal vector N:\n\n|N| = sqrt((2*u*v*cos(w))^2 + (-v*(1 + 4*u^2)*sin(w))^2 + (v*(1 + 4*u^2)*cos(w))^2)\n|N| = v*sqrt(1 + 4*u^2)\n\nThe unit normal vector n = N/|N|:\n\nn = (2*u*cos(w)/(sqrt(1 + 4*u^2)), -sin(w), cos(w))\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form. We need to find the second partial derivatives of r:\n\nr_uu = (∂²r/∂u²) = (0, 2*cos(w), 2*sin(w))\nr_uw = (∂²r/∂u∂w) = (0, -2*u*sin(w), 2*u*cos(w))\nr_ww = (∂²r/∂w²) = (0, -v*cos(w), -v*sin(w))\n\nNow, we compute the components of the second fundamental form h_ij:\n\nh_11 = <r_uu, n> = 2*cos(w)*(-sin(w)) + 2*sin(w)*cos(w) = 0\nh_12 = h_21 = <r_uw, n> = -2*u*sin^2(w) + 2*u*cos^2(w) = 2*u\nh_22 = <r_ww, n> = -v*cos^2(w) - v*sin^2(w) = -v\n\nFinally, we compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (h_11*h_22 - h_12*h_21) / (g_11*g_22 - g_12*g_21)\n\nAt the point (1, 1), we have u = 1 and v = 1^2 = 1. So, we have:\n\ng_11 = 1 + 4*1^2 = 5\ng_22 = 1^2 = 1\ng_12 = g_21 = 0\n\nh_11 = 0\nh_22 = -1\nh_12 = h_21 = 2*1 = 2\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (0*(-1) - 2*2) / (5*1 - 0*0) = -4/5\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface S at the point (1, 1) is -4/5."
