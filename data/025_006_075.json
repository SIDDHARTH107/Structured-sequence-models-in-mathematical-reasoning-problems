    "message_2": "To compute the H^2 cohomology group of V with coefficients in the field F_2, we will use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for a smooth projective variety V of dimension n, and a hyperplane section H, the restriction map H^k(V) -> H^k(H) is an isomorphism for k < n and an injection for k = n.\n\nIn our case, V is a smooth cubic surface in P^3, so it has dimension n = 2. Let H be a hyperplane section of V. Then H is a smooth curve of genus g, and we have:\n\nH^0(V) = H^0(H) = F_2 (since both V and H are connected)\nH^1(V) = H^1(H) (by Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for k < n)\nH^2(V) -> H^2(H) is injective (by Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for k = n)\n\nNow, we need to compute the cohomology of H. Since H is a smooth curve of genus g, we have:\n\nH^0(H) = F_2\nH^1(H) = F_2^(2g)\nH^2(H) = F_2\n\nBy the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have:\n\nH^2(V) -> H^2(H) = F_2 is injective\n\nThus, H^2(V) is either 0 or F_2. However, since V is a smooth projective variety of dimension 2, it has a fundamental class in H^2(V). Therefore, H^2(V) cannot be 0, and we conclude that:\n\nH^2(V) = F_2"
