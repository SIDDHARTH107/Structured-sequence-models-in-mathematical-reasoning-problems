    "message_1": "A company sells a product with a variable cost of $40 to manufacture. There are two other companies selling the same product with similar variable costs. The buyers demand 10,000 units of the product in the market. The demand curve is represented by Q = 10,000 - P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. What should be the optimal price for the company to maximize its profit assuming it behaves like a Bertrand competitor in the market?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete on price, and the firm with the lowest price captures the entire market demand. Since there are three firms with similar variable costs, we can assume that they will all set their prices equal to their marginal cost (MC) to maximize their profits. In this case, the marginal cost is equal to the variable cost, which is $40.\n\nAs a Bertrand competitor, the company should set its price equal to its marginal cost to maximize its profit. Therefore, the optimal price for the company to set is $40."
