    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit per unit for product A and B is $10 and $15, respectively. The company has 1000 units of material X and 1500 units of material Y for production. Each unit of product A requires 3 units of material X and 4 units of material Y, whereas each unit of product B requires 4 units of material X and 3 units of material Y. The maximum demand for product A and B is 200 and 150 units, respectively. Using tabu search, what is the maximum profit the company can earn?",
    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is not well-suited for simple linear programming problems like this one. Instead, we can solve this problem using linear programming techniques.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Material X constraint: 3x + 4y ≤ 1000\n2. Material Y constraint: 4x + 3y ≤ 1500\n3. Maximum demand for product A: x ≤ 200\n4. Maximum demand for product B: y ≤ 150\n5. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can graph the feasible region and find the vertices of the feasible region. Then, we can evaluate the profit function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices (0, 0), (0, 150), (200, 0), (150, 100), and (300, 0). Evaluating the profit function at each vertex, we have:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 0\n2. P(0, 150) = 2250\n3. P(200, 0) = 2000\n4. P(150, 100) = 3000\n5. P(300, 0) = 0 (not feasible because it violates the Material X constraint)\n\nThe maximum profit is $3000, which occurs when the company produces 150 units of product A and 100 units of product B."
