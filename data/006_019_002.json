    "message_1": "What is the probability of a political party winning at least 80 out of 100 seats in a parliament, given that their historic success rate in winning seats is 60%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of winning exactly k seats out of n\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes out of n trials, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (winning a seat) in a single trial, which is 60% or 0.6\n- n is the total number of trials (seats), which is 100\n- k is the number of successes (seats won), which is at least 80\n\nSince we want to find the probability of winning at least 80 seats, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for winning 80, 81, 82, ..., 100 seats. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nP(X >= 80) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 80 to 100\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X >= 80) = Σ C(100, k) * (0.6)^k * (0.4)^(100-k) for k = 80 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum can be computationally intensive, so it's best to use a calculator or software that can handle binomial probabilities. Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nP(X >= 80) ≈ 0.000118\n\nSo, the probability of the political party winning at least 80 out of 100 seats in the parliament is approximately 0.0118% or 0.000118."
