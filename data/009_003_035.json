    "message_1": "Consider a rod of length 1 meter with the ends held at temperature 0°C. Initially, the rod is at temperature 100°C. The differential equation for the temperature distribution in the rod is given by:\n\nd²T/dx² = k * dT/dt\n\nwhere T is the temperature at position x along the rod, k is a constant, and t is time.\n\nIf k = 0.001 m²/s and the time elapsed is 10 seconds, determine the temperature of the rod at x = 0.5 meters.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. First, let's assume that the temperature distribution T(x, t) can be separated into two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x) * Θ(t)\n\nNow, substitute this into the given differential equation:\n\nd²T/dx² = k * dT/dt\nd²(X * Θ)/dx² = k * d(X * Θ)/dt\n\nDivide both sides by X(x) * Θ(t):\n\n(1/X) * d²X/dx² = (k/Θ) * dΘ/dt\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call -λ:\n\n(1/X) * d²X/dx² = -λ\n(k/Θ) * dΘ/dt = -λ\n\nNow, we have two separate ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. d²X/dx² + λX = 0\n2. dΘ/dt + λkΘ = 0\n\nSolve the second equation for Θ(t):\n\nΘ(t) = C1 * exp(-λkt)\n\nNow, solve the first equation for X(x). This is an eigenvalue problem, and since the boundary conditions are X(0) = X(1) = 0, we know that the solutions will be of the form:\n\nX(x) = sin(nπx), where n is a positive integer\n\nNow, we can find the eigenvalues λ:\n\nλ = n²π²\n\nThe general solution for the temperature distribution T(x, t) is a sum of the product of X(x) and Θ(t):\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [Cn * sin(nπx) * exp(-n²π²kt)]\n\nTo find the coefficients Cn, we use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 100°C:\n\n100 = Σ [Cn * sin(nπx)]\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, and the coefficients can be found using the formula:\n\nCn = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nIn our case, f(x) = 100, L = 1, and the integral is from 0 to 1:\n\nCn = 2 * ∫[100 * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\nCn = (200/πn) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) for odd n, and 0 for even n\n\nNow, we can write the temperature distribution T(x, t) as:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ [(200/πn) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * sin(nπx) * exp(-n²π²kt)] for odd n\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature at x = 0.5 meters and t = 10 seconds:\n\nT(0.5, 10) = Σ [(200/πn) * (-1)^((n-1)/2) * sin(nπ/2) * exp(-n²π²(0.001)(10))] for odd n\n\nTo get an approximate value, we can sum the first few terms of the series:\n\nT(0.5, 10) ≈ (200/π) * [(-1) * exp(-π²(0.001)(10)) + (1/3) * exp(-9π²(0.001)(10)) + (-1/5) * exp(-25π²(0.001)(10)) + ...]\n\nT(0.5, 10) ≈ 29.3°C\n\nSo, the temperature of the rod at x = 0.5 meters and t = 10 seconds is approximately 29.3°C."
