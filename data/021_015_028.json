    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It is a heuristic optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling.\n\nTo solve the given problem using PSO, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the swarm with random positions and velocities within the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each particle.\n3. Update the personal best and global best positions.\n4. Update the velocities and positions of the particles.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the maximum number of iterations.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the PSO algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 - 5*x**2 - 3*x + 7\n\ndef pso(swarm_size, max_iter, inertia_weight, search_space):\n    particles = [{'position': random.uniform(search_space[0], search_space[1]), 'velocity': 0, 'best_position': 0, 'best_fitness': float('inf')} for _ in range(swarm_size)]\n    global_best_position = 0\n    global_best_fitness = float('inf')\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        for particle in particles:\n            fitness = f(particle['position'])\n\n            if fitness < particle['best_fitness']:\n                particle['best_fitness'] = fitness\n                particle['best_position'] = particle['position']\n\n            if fitness < global_best_fitness:\n                global_best_fitness = fitness\n                global_best_position = particle['position']\n\n        for particle in particles:\n            r1, r2 = random.random(), random.random()\n            cognitive = 2 * r1 * (particle['best_position'] - particle['position'])\n            social = 2 * r2 * (global_best_position - particle['position'])\n            particle['velocity'] = inertia_weight * particle['velocity'] + cognitive + social\n            particle['position'] += particle['velocity']\n\n    return global_best_position, global_best_fitness\n\nswarm_size = 10\nmax_iter = 100\ninertia_weight = 0.8\nsearch_space = [-5, 5]\n\nx_min, f_min = pso(swarm_size, max_iter, inertia_weight, search_space)\nprint(f\"x_min: {x_min:.4f}, f_min: {f_min:.4f}\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the value of x that minimizes the function f(x) and the corresponding minimum value of the function, accurate up to 4 decimal places. Note that due to the random nature of the PSO algorithm, the result may vary slightly between runs."
