    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph G is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in G. A complete subgraph is a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph G:\n\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nEdges: {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {4, 5}, {5, 6}}\n\nWe can see that there is a complete subgraph with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} and edges {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}}. This subgraph is a clique of size 4.\n\nThere is no complete subgraph with 5 vertices, as vertex 6 is only connected to vertex 5 and not to any other vertices.\n\nTherefore, the clique number of G is 4."
