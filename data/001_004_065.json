    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial x² + 6x + 8 completely, we look for two numbers that multiply to 8 and add to 6. Those numbers are 4 and 2. So, we can rewrite the polynomial as:\n\nx² + 4x + 2x + 8\n\nNow, we can factor by grouping:\n\nx(x + 4) + 2(x + 4)\n\nNotice that (x + 4) is a common factor in both terms. We can factor it out:\n\n(x + 4)(x + 2)\n\nSo, the completely factored form of the polynomial x² + 6x + 8 is:\n\n(x + 4)(x + 2)"
