    "message_2": "To solve the given boundary value problem, we first solve the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n\n$z \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} + (z-2)w = 0$\n\nWe can rewrite the ODE as:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} + \\frac{(z-2)}{z}w = 0$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and we can solve it using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by:\n\n$I(z) = e^{\\int \\frac{(z-2)}{z} dz} = e^{\\int (1 - \\frac{2}{z}) dz} = e^{z - 2\\ln{z}} = ze^{-z}$\n\nNow, we multiply the ODE by the integrating factor:\n\n$ze^{-z}\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} + (z-2)e^{-z}w = 0$\n\nThe left-hand side of the equation is now the derivative of the product of $w(z)$ and the integrating factor:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(we^{-z}) = 0$\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $z$, we get:\n\n$we^{-z} = C$\n\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Now, we can solve for $w(z)$:\n\n$w(z) = Ce^{z}$\n\nTo find the constant $C$, we use the boundary condition $w(1) = 2$:\n\n$2 = Ce^{1}$\n\nSo, $C = 2e^{-1}$, and the solution to the ODE is:\n\n$w(z) = 2e^{-1}e^{z}$\n\nNow, we need to check if this solution satisfies the second boundary condition:\n\n$w(re^{i\\theta}) \\rightarrow 1$ as $r \\rightarrow \\infty$\n\nSubstitute $z = re^{i\\theta}$ into the solution:\n\n$w(re^{i\\theta}) = 2e^{-1}e^{re^{i\\theta}}$\n\nAs $r \\rightarrow \\infty$, the term $e^{re^{i\\theta}}$ will dominate the expression, and the solution will not approach 1. Therefore, the given boundary value problem has no solution that satisfies both boundary conditions."
