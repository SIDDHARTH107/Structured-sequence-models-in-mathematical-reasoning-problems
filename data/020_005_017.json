    "message_1": "John has to distribute 100 bags of rice and 80 bags of sugar to a village with 120 families. Each family can only receive one bag of rice and one bag of sugar. However, due to limited storage space in the trucks, John can only load a total of 150 bags in each truck. How many trucks does John need to make sure all families in the village receive their bags of rice and sugar, and what is the maximum number of bags that will be left over? Solve this problem using integer programming.",
    "message_2": "Let's use integer programming to solve this problem. Let x be the number of trucks carrying rice and y be the number of trucks carrying sugar.\n\nObjective function: Minimize x + y (the total number of trucks)\n\nConstraints:\n1. 150x >= 100 (each truck can carry at most 150 bags of rice, and there are 100 bags of rice)\n2. 150y >= 80 (each truck can carry at most 150 bags of sugar, and there are 80 bags of sugar)\n3. x, y >= 0 (the number of trucks must be non-negative)\n\nNow, let's solve the problem:\n\n1. 150x >= 100 -> x >= 100/150 -> x >= 2/3\nSince x must be an integer, the smallest value for x is 1.\n\n2. 150y >= 80 -> y >= 80/150 -> y >= 8/15\nSince y must be an integer, the smallest value for y is 1.\n\nSo, the minimum number of trucks is x + y = 1 + 1 = 2 trucks.\n\nNow let's find the maximum number of bags that will be left over:\n\nTruck 1 (carrying rice): 150 - 100 = 50 bags left\nTruck 2 (carrying sugar): 150 - 80 = 70 bags left\n\nThe maximum number of bags that will be left over is 50 + 70 = 120 bags.\n\nTherefore, John needs 2 trucks to distribute the bags of rice and sugar, and the maximum number of bags that will be left over is 120."
