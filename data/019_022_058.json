The customer can choose between two different burger options, three different fry options, and four different drink options. How many different meal deals can a customer create?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of different meal deals a customer can create, we can use the counting principle. We multiply the number of options for each item together.\n\nNumber of burger options: 2\nNumber of fry options: 3\nNumber of drink options: 4\n\nTotal number of meal deals: 2 (burgers) × 3 (fries) × 4 (drinks) = 24 different meal deals."
