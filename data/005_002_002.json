The sample mean was found to be 2.5 hours, with a standard deviation of 0.8 hours. Using a 95% confidence interval, what is the range of times within which we can be 95% confident that the true population mean lies?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true population mean, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nFirst, we need to find the critical value for a 95% confidence interval. Since we are using a normal distribution, we will use the Z-score. For a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96.\n\nNow, we have all the information we need to calculate the confidence interval:\n\nSample Mean = 2.5 hours\nStandard Deviation = 0.8 hours\nSample Size = 100 students\nCritical Value (Z-score) = 1.96\n\nConfidence Interval = 2.5 ± (1.96 * (0.8 / √100))\n\nConfidence Interval = 2.5 ± (1.96 * (0.8 / 10))\n\nConfidence Interval = 2.5 ± (1.96 * 0.08)\n\nConfidence Interval = 2.5 ± 0.1568\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval is (2.5 - 0.1568, 2.5 + 0.1568) or (2.3432, 2.6568).\n\nWe can be 95% confident that the true population mean of the time students spend on social media per day lies between 2.3432 hours and 2.6568 hours."
