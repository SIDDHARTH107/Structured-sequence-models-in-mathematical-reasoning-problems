Specifically, find the image of the quarter disk in the upper half plane with the vertices at $0, 1, i$.",
    "message_2": "To find the image of the upper half plane under the mapping $f(z) = \\frac{1}{\\bar{z}}$, we first need to find the image of the boundary of the upper half plane, which is the real axis. Let $z = x + 0i$ be a point on the real axis, where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then, $\\bar{z} = x - 0i = x$. Thus, $f(z) = \\frac{1}{x}$, which is also a point on the real axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis under the mapping $f(z)$ is the real axis itself.\n\nNow, let $z = x + yi$ be a point in the upper half plane, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $y > 0$. Then, $\\bar{z} = x - yi$, and $f(z) = \\frac{1}{x - yi} = \\frac{x + yi}{x^2 + y^2}$. Since $y > 0$, the imaginary part of $f(z)$ is positive, which means that $f(z)$ is also in the upper half plane. Therefore, the image of the upper half plane under the mapping $f(z)$ is the upper half plane itself.\n\nNow, let's find the image of the quarter disk in the upper half plane with the vertices at $0, 1, i$. The boundary of this quarter disk consists of three segments: the line segment from $0$ to $1$, the line segment from $1$ to $i$, and the line segment from $i$ to $0$. \n\n1. For the line segment from $0$ to $1$, let $z = x + 0i$, where $0 \\le x \\le 1$. Then, $f(z) = \\frac{1}{x}$, where $1 \\le \\frac{1}{x} \\le \\infty$. This maps to the line segment from $1$ to $\\infty$ on the real axis.\n\n2. For the line segment from $1$ to $i$, let $z = 1 + yi$, where $0 \\le y \\le 1$. Then, $f(z) = \\frac{1 - yi}{1 + y^2}$. This maps to the line segment from $1$ to $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}i$.\n\n3. For the line segment from $i$ to $0$, let $z = yi$, where $0 \\le y \\le 1$. Then, $f(z) = \\frac{yi}{y^2} = \\frac{i}{y}$. This maps to the line segment from $i$ to $\\infty i$.\n\nPutting these three segments together, the image of the quarter disk in the upper half plane with the vertices at $0, 1, i$ under the mapping $f(z)$ is the region bounded by the line segments from $1$ to $\\infty$ on the real axis, from $1$ to $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}i$, and from $i$ to $\\infty i$."
