    "message_2": "To define the multiplication table for a group of order 10, we first need to list the elements of the group. Let's denote the group as G, and its elements as {e, a, a^2, ..., a^9}, where e is the identity element and a is a generator of the group.\n\nNow, we need to define the multiplication operation for the group. Since the group has order 10, the operation must satisfy the following properties:\n\n1. Closure: For all x, y in G, x * y is also in G.\n2. Associativity: For all x, y, z in G, (x * y) * z = x * (y * z).\n3. Identity: There exists an element e in G such that for all x in G, x * e = e * x = x.\n4. Inverse: For each x in G, there exists an element x' in G such that x * x' = x' * x = e.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group C10: This group is generated by a single element a, such that a^10 = e. The multiplication table for this group is defined as a^i * a^j = a^(i+j) mod 10. This group is abelian, as the operation is commutative.\n\n2. Dihedral group D5: This group represents the symmetries of a regular pentagon and has 10 elements. We can define the elements as {r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, s0, s1, s2, s3, s4}, where r represents a rotation and s represents a reflection. The multiplication operation can be defined as follows:\n\n   - ri * rj = r(i+j) mod 5\n   - ri * sj = s(i+j) mod 5\n   - si * rj = s(i-j) mod 5\n   - si * sj = r(i-j) mod 5\n\n   This group is non-abelian, as the operation is not commutative.\n\n3. Non-abelian group of order 10: There is only one non-abelian group of order 10, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5. Therefore, there is no other non-abelian group of order 10 to consider.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two possible ways to define the multiplication table for a group of order 10: the cyclic group C10 and the dihedral group D5. The cyclic group C10 is abelian, while the dihedral group D5 is non-abelian."
