    "message_2": "To calculate the Lyapunov exponent for the given dynamical system, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x(1-x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(4x(1-x))/dx = 4(1 - 2x)\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent is defined as the average growth rate of the logarithm of the distance between two nearby points in the phase space as they evolve under the dynamics of the system. For a one-dimensional system, it can be calculated as:\n\nλ = lim (n -> ∞) (1/n) * Σ[log|f'(x_i)|]\n\nwhere x_i is the sequence of iterates generated by the dynamical system.\n\nWe have x_1 = 0.2, and we can calculate a few more iterates to estimate the Lyapunov exponent:\n\nx_2 = 4 * 0.2 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.64\nx_3 = 4 * 0.64 * (1 - 0.64) = 0.9216\nx_4 = 4 * 0.9216 * (1 - 0.9216) = 0.28901376\n...\n\nNow, we can calculate the Lyapunov exponent using these iterates:\n\nλ ≈ (1/3) * [log|4(1 - 2 * 0.2)| + log|4(1 - 2 * 0.64)| + log|4(1 - 2 * 0.9216)|]\nλ ≈ (1/3) * [log|2.4| + log|-0.8| + log|3.536|]\nλ ≈ (1/3) * [0.778151 + 0.096910 + 1.548219]\nλ ≈ 0.807760\n\nSince the Lyapunov exponent λ > 0, the dynamical system is considered chaotic."
