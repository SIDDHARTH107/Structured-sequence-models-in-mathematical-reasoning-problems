    "message_1": "In a factory, the probability of an accident occurring in a day is 0.05. Calculate the probability of no accident occurring in the next 3 days.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of no accident occurring in the next 3 days, we first need to find the probability of no accident occurring in a single day. Since the probability of an accident occurring in a day is 0.05, the probability of no accident occurring in a day is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of no accident occurring for 3 consecutive days. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of no accident occurring in each day:\n\nProbability of no accident in 3 days = (0.95) * (0.95) * (0.95) = 0.857375.\n\nSo, the probability of no accident occurring in the next 3 days is approximately 0.857 or 85.7%."
