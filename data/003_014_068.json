    "message_2": "The period of a sine function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π / |B|\n\nwhere y = A sin(Bx) + C and B is the coefficient of x inside the sine function.\n\nIn the given function y = 2 sin(3x) + 4, the value of B is 3.\n\nSo, the period of the function is:\n\nPeriod = 2π / |3|\n\nPeriod = 2π / 3\n\nTherefore, the period of the function y = 2 sin(3x) + 4 is (2π/3) radians."
