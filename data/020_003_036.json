For each unit of X produced, it incurs a fixed cost of $10 and variable cost of $5. For each unit of Y produced, it incurs a fixed cost of $20 and variable cost of $2. The company has a production capacity of 200 units and 300 units for X and Y respectively. Find the optimal production quantities of X and Y that maximize the company's profit, given that the selling price of X and Y is $50 and $30 respectively.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced. The profit function P(x, y) can be defined as the total revenue minus the total cost.\n\nTotal revenue for product X = selling price * number of units = 50x\nTotal revenue for product Y = selling price * number of units = 30y\n\nTotal cost for product X = (fixed cost + variable cost) * number of units = (10 + 5)x = 15x\nTotal cost for product Y = (fixed cost + variable cost) * number of units = (20 + 2)y = 22y\n\nProfit function P(x, y) = Total revenue - Total cost = (50x + 30y) - (15x + 22y) = 35x + 8y\n\nWe need to maximize the profit function P(x, y) subject to the constraints:\n\n1. Production capacity for X: 0 ≤ x ≤ 200\n2. Production capacity for Y: 0 ≤ y ≤ 300\n\nThe profit function is linear, and the constraints define a rectangular feasible region. The maximum value of the profit function will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nThere are four vertices to consider:\n\n1. (x, y) = (0, 0)\n2. (x, y) = (200, 0)\n3. (x, y) = (0, 300)\n4. (x, y) = (200, 300)\n\nNow, we evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 35(0) + 8(0) = 0\n2. P(200, 0) = 35(200) + 8(0) = 7000\n3. P(0, 300) = 35(0) + 8(300) = 2400\n4. P(200, 300) = 35(200) + 8(300) = 9400\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (200, 300), with a profit of $9,400. Therefore, the company should produce 200 units of product X and 300 units of product Y to maximize its profit."
