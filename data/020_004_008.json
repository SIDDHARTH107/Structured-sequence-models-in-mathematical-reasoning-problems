    "message_1": "A toy manufacturer produces two types of stuffed animals, bears and rabbits. Each bear requires 2 pounds of stuffing and 1 hour of labor to produce, while each rabbit requires 1 pound of stuffing and 2 hours of labor. The company has 100 pounds of stuffing and 80 hours of labor available for production. A bear sells for $20 and a rabbit sells for $15. How many of each type of animal should be produced to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of bears produced and y be the number of rabbits produced.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are:\n\n1. Stuffing constraint: 2x + y ≤ 100 (each bear requires 2 pounds of stuffing and each rabbit requires 1 pound of stuffing)\n2. Labor constraint: x + 2y ≤ 80 (each bear requires 1 hour of labor and each rabbit requires 2 hours of labor)\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: P(x, y) = 20x + 15y (each bear sells for $20 and each rabbit sells for $15)\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region. Then, we will evaluate the profit function at each corner point of the feasible region to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, let's find the boundary lines of the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y = 100\n2. x + 2y = 80\n\nNow, let's find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of the stuffing constraint (2x + y = 100) and the labor constraint (x + 2y = 80):\n\nSubstitute y from the first equation into the second equation:\nx + 2(100 - 2x) = 80\nx + 200 - 4x = 80\n3x = 120\nx = 40\n\nSo, y = 100 - 2(40) = 20\n\nThe intersection point is (40, 20).\n\n2. Intersection of the stuffing constraint (2x + y = 100) and the x-axis (y = 0):\n2x + 0 = 100\nx = 50\n\nThe intersection point is (50, 0).\n\n3. Intersection of the labor constraint (x + 2y = 80) and the y-axis (x = 0):\n0 + 2y = 80\ny = 40\n\nThe intersection point is (0, 40).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the profit function at each corner point:\n\n1. P(40, 20) = 20(40) + 15(20) = 800 + 300 = $1100\n2. P(50, 0) = 20(50) + 15(0) = 1000 + 0 = $1000\n3. P(0, 40) = 20(0) + 15(40) = 0 + 600 = $600\n\nThe maximum profit of $1100 is achieved when 40 bears and 20 rabbits are produced."
