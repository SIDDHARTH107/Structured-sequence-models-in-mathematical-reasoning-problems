    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. To find the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 100, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 100 and see if 2p + 1 is also prime.\n\nThe first prime number greater than 100 is 101. Let's check if 2(101) + 1 is prime:\n\n2(101) + 1 = 202 + 1 = 203\n\n203 is not prime (divisible by 7), so 101 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nThe next prime number is 103. Let's check if 2(103) + 1 is prime:\n\n2(103) + 1 = 206 + 1 = 207\n\n207 is not prime (divisible by 3), so 103 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nThe next prime number is 107. Let's check if 2(107) + 1 is prime:\n\n2(107) + 1 = 214 + 1 = 215\n\n215 is not prime (divisible by 5), so 107 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nThe next prime number is 109. Let's check if 2(109) + 1 is prime:\n\n2(109) + 1 = 218 + 1 = 219\n\n219 is not prime (divisible by 3), so 109 is not a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nThe next prime number is 113. Let's check if 2(113) + 1 is prime:\n\n2(113) + 1 = 226 + 1 = 227\n\n227 is prime, so 113 is a Sophie Germain prime.\n\nTherefore, the smallest Sophie Germain prime greater than 100 is 113."
