    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of the cylindrical can, we need to calculate the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe formula for the surface area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. The diameter of the soda can is 6 cm, so the radius is half of that, which is 3 cm.\n\nSurface area of one circular base = π(3 cm)² = 9π cm²\n\nSince there are two bases, we multiply the surface area of one base by 2:\n\nTotal surface area of both bases = 2 × 9π cm² = 18π cm²\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area of the cylinder. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nLateral surface area = 2π(3 cm)(15 cm) = 90π cm²\n\nNow, we add the surface areas of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal surface area = 18π cm² + 90π cm² = 108π cm²\n\nTo round the answer to the nearest tenth, we multiply by the value of π (approximately 3.14):\n\nTotal surface area ≈ 108 × 3.14 cm² ≈ 339.12 cm²\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cylindrical can is approximately 339.1 cm² when rounded to the nearest tenth."
