    "message_2": "To compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the vector field $\\partial_y$, we need to apply the Leibniz rule for tensor fields. The Leibniz rule states that for a tensor field $T$ of type $(r, s)$ and a vector field $X$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_X T$ is also a tensor field of type $(r, s)$, and its components can be computed as follows:\n\n$(\\nabla_X T)^{i_1 \\dots i_r}_{j_1 \\dots j_s} = X(T^{i_1 \\dots i_r}_{j_1 \\dots j_s}) - \\sum_{k=1}^r T^{i_1 \\dots i_{k-1} m i_{k+1} \\dots i_r}_{j_1 \\dots j_s} \\Gamma^m_{i_k p} X^p + \\sum_{k=1}^s T^{i_1 \\dots i_r}_{j_1 \\dots j_{k-1} m j_{k+1} \\dots j_s} \\Gamma^m_{j_k p} X^p$\n\nIn our case, $T$ is a mixed tensor field of type $(1, 1)$, and $X = \\partial_y$. The components of $T$ are given by:\n\n$T^x_x = x^2, \\quad T^x_y = x^3, \\quad T^y_y = \\cos(x+y)$\n\nAll other components are zero. Since we are working on the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^m_{i_k p}$ are all zero, as the Levi-Civita connection coincides with the standard flat connection on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to $\\partial_y$ simplifies to:\n\n$(\\nabla_{\\partial_y} T)^i_j = \\partial_y(T^i_j)$\n\nNow we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\partial_y(T^x_x) = 0$\n\n$\\partial_y(T^x_y) = 0$\n\n$\\partial_y(T^y_y) = -\\sin(x+y)$\n\nAll other components are zero. Thus, the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to $\\partial_y$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\partial_y} T = -\\sin(x+y) \\mathrm{d}y \\otimes \\mathrm{d}y$"
