The three bidders believe that the item being auctioned is worth $600, $800, and $1000 to them, respectively. What is the expected revenue for the seller if the auction uses a second-price sealed bid format?\n\nHint: In a second-price sealed bid format, the highest bidder wins the item, but only pays the amount of the second highest bid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected revenue for the seller in a second-price sealed bid auction, we need to consider all possible bid combinations and their probabilities. Let's assume that each bidder bids their true valuation for the item. In this case, there are 3! (3 factorial) or 6 possible bid orderings:\n\n1. $600, $800, $1000\n2. $600, $1000, $800\n3. $800, $600, $1000\n4. $800, $1000, $600\n5. $1000, $600, $800\n6. $1000, $800, $600\n\nIn a second-price sealed bid auction, the highest bidder wins the item but pays the amount of the second-highest bid. So, for each of the 6 possible bid orderings, the revenue for the seller is:\n\n1. $800\n2. $800\n3. $600\n4. $800\n5. $800\n6. $800\n\nSince each bid ordering has an equal probability of occurring (1/6), we can calculate the expected revenue by taking the average of the revenues for each possible ordering:\n\nExpected revenue = (1/6) * ($800 + $800 + $600 + $800 + $800 + $800) = (1/6) * $4600 = $766.67\n\nSo, the expected revenue for the seller in this second-price sealed bid auction is $766.67."
