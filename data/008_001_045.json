    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the matrix method, we first represent the system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2  3  4 | 20 ]\n[ 5  6  7 | 38 ]\n[ 8  9 10 | 56 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform Gaussian elimination to obtain a row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 2.5 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[  2   3   4 |  20 ]\n[  0  -1.5 -3 | -12 ]\n[  0   3   6 |  16 ]\n```\n\n2. Multiply the second row by -2/3 to make the leading coefficient of the second row equal to 1:\n\n```\n[  2   3   4 |  20 ]\n[  0   1   2 |   8 ]\n[  0   3   6 |  16 ]\n```\n\n3. Subtract 3 times the second row from the third row:\n\n```\n[  2   3   4 |  20 ]\n[  0   1   2 |   8 ]\n[  0   0   0 |   0 ]\n```\n\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form. Since the last row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, it doesn't provide any new information. We are left with the following system of equations:\n\n```\n2x + 3y + 4z = 20\ny + 2z = 8\n```\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the solutions:\n\nFrom the second equation, we have y = 8 - 2z. We can substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n2x + 3(8 - 2z) + 4z = 20\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2x + 24 - 6z + 4z = 20\n\n2x - 2z = -4\n\nx - z = -2\n\nSince we have two variables (z and x) and only one equation, there are infinitely many solutions. We can express the solution in terms of the free variable z:\n\nx = z - 2\ny = 8 - 2z\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is given by the parametric form (z - 2, 8 - 2z, z) for any value of z."
