    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the differential evolution optimization method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population with 25 random individuals within the interval [0, 5].\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual using the function f(x) = (x-1)² + 5sin(x).\n3. Perform the mutation, crossover, and selection steps until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of fitness).\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the differential evolution algorithm to find the minimum value of the given function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return (x - 1)**2 + 5 * np.sin(x)\n\ndef differential_evolution(pop_size, bounds, F, CR, max_iter):\n    # Initialize the population\n    population = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1], size=(pop_size, 1))\n\n    # Evaluate the fitness of each individual\n    fitness = np.array([f(x) for x in population])\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        for i in range(pop_size):\n            # Mutation\n            a, b, c = population[np.random.choice(pop_size, 3, replace=False)]\n            mutant = a + F * (b - c)\n\n            # Crossover\n            trial = population[i].copy()\n            j_rand = np.random.randint(0, 1)\n            if np.random.rand() < CR or j_rand == 0:\n                trial[0] = mutant[0]\n\n            # Selection\n            trial_fitness = f(trial)\n            if trial_fitness < fitness[i]:\n                population[i] = trial\n                fitness[i] = trial_fitness\n\n    # Find the best solution\n    best_index = np.argmin(fitness)\n    best_solution = population[best_index]\n    best_fitness = fitness[best_index]\n\n    return best_solution, best_fitness\n\n# Parameters\npop_size = 25\nbounds = [0, 5]\nF = 0.8\nCR = 0.5\nmax_iter = 1000\n\n# Run the differential evolution algorithm\nbest_solution, best_fitness = differential_evolution(pop_size, bounds, F, CR, max_iter)\nprint(\"Minimum value of f(x):\", best_fitness)\nprint(\"x value at the minimum:\", best_solution)\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum value of the function f(x) and the corresponding x value. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm. You can increase the number of iterations or the population size for better accuracy."
