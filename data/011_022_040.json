    "message_1": "A student goes to a store to buy some snacks before going to a movie. The student has $20 and wants to buy as many snacks as possible. The store has three types of snacks available: chips for $5, cookies for $3, and candy for $2. What is the maximum number of snacks that the student can buy without going over their budget?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the number of snacks the student can buy, they should prioritize buying the cheapest snacks first. In this case, the cheapest snack is candy for $2. \n\nLet's see how many candies the student can buy with their $20 budget:\n\n$20 รท $2 = 10\n\nThe student can buy 10 candies with their $20 budget. However, they should also check if they can buy a combination of cookies and candies to maximize the number of snacks.\n\nLet's see how many cookies and candies they can buy:\n\n1 cookie ($3) + 8 candies ($16) = 9 snacks for $19\n\n2 cookies ($6) + 7 candies ($14) = 9 snacks for $20\n\nAs we can see, the student can buy a maximum of 9 snacks (2 cookies and 7 candies) without going over their budget."
