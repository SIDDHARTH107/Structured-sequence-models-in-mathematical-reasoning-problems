    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C respectively. In this case, we have a = 5, b = 7, and c = 9. We want to find the measure of angle C.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n9^2 = 5^2 + 7^2 - 2 * 5 * 7 * cos(C)\n\n81 = 25 + 49 - 70 * cos(C)\n\n7 = 74 - 70 * cos(C)\n\nNow, isolate cos(C):\n\ncos(C) = (74 - 7) / 70\ncos(C) = 67 / 70\n\nNow, to find the measure of angle C, we take the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value we found:\n\nC = arccos(67/70)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nC ≈ 27.46°\n\nSo, the measure of the angle opposite the side of length 9 is approximately 27.46°."
