    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set constructed by removing the middle third of a line segment repeatedly can be found using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Cantor set, there are N = 2 self-similar pieces (the two remaining line segments after removing the middle third) and the scaling factor r = 3 (each remaining segment is 1/3 the length of the original segment).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.63\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is approximately 0.63, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
