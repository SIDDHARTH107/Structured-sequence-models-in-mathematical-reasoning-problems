    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve can be found using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nAfter the first iteration of the construction process, the initial line segment is replaced by 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, N = 4 and s = 1/3.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(4) / log(1/3)\n\nD ≈ 1.2619\n\nSo, the exact Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the first iteration of the construction process is approximately 1.2619."
