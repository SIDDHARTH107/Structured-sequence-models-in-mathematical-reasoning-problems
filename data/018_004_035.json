    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to define a universal set U that contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of set A, denoted as A', will be the set of all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nFor example, if we consider the universal set U to be the set of integers from 1 to 20, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}, then the complement of set A with respect to U would be:\n\nA' = {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}\n\nThe principle of unique complement states that for any set A and its complement A', the intersection of A and A' is an empty set, and the union of A and A' is the universal set U. In this case, A ∩ A' = ∅ and A ∪ A' = U.\n\nNote that the complement of set A depends on the universal set U chosen. If a different universal set is chosen, the complement of set A will be different."
