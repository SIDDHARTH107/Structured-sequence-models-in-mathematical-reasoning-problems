    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + 2W\n\nSince the perimeter is 100 meters, we have:\n\n100 = 2L + 2W\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that maximize the area. The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nWe can rewrite the perimeter equation to isolate either L or W. Let's isolate W:\n\nW = (100 - 2L) / 2\nW = 50 - L\n\nNow, substitute this expression for W into the area equation:\n\nArea = L * (50 - L)\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of L:\n\nArea = -L^2 + 50L\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can find the vertex of this quadratic equation. The x-coordinate of the vertex (L-coordinate in this case) is given by the formula:\n\nL = -b / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = -1 and b = 50, so:\n\nL = -50 / (2 * -1)\nL = 25\n\nNow, substitute this value of L back into the equation for W:\n\nW = 50 - 25\nW = 25\n\nSo, the dimensions that maximize the area of the rectangular piece of land are 25 meters by 25 meters."
