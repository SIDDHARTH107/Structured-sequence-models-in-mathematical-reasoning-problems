The distances between the towns are as follows: \n\n- Town A to Town B: 30 km\n- Town A to Town C: 45 km\n- Town A to Town D: 55 km\n- Town B to Town C: 20 km\n- Town B to Town D: 25 km\n- Town C to Town D: 35 km\n\nAssuming the truck can only visit each town once and must return to the starting point, what is the shortest distance the truck can travel while visiting all four towns?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance, we need to consider all possible routes and calculate the total distance for each route. Since there are 4 towns, there are 3! = 6 possible routes (excluding the return to the starting point). Let's assume the truck starts at Town A:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → A\n2. A → B → D → C → A\n3. A → C → B → D → A\n4. A → C → D → B → A\n5. A → D → B → C → A\n6. A → D → C → B → A\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance for each route:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → A: 30 + 20 + 35 + 55 = 140 km\n2. A → B → D → C → A: 30 + 25 + 20 + 45 = 120 km\n3. A → C → B → D → A: 45 + 20 + 25 + 55 = 145 km\n4. A → C → D → B → A: 45 + 35 + 25 + 30 = 135 km\n5. A → D → B → C → A: 55 + 25 + 20 + 45 = 145 km\n6. A → D → C → B → A: 55 + 35 + 20 + 30 = 140 km\n\nThe shortest distance is 120 km, which corresponds to the route A → B → D → C → A."
