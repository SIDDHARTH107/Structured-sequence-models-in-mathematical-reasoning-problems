    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction algorithm. Let P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial of G with k colors. We will first label the vertices of the graph as follows:\n\n![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/7Y3y1qT.png)\n\nNow, let's apply the deletion-contraction algorithm:\n\n1. Choose an edge to delete and contract. We will choose the edge connecting vertices A and B.\n2. Delete the edge and find the chromatic polynomial of the resulting graph. This is P(G-e, k), where e is the edge we deleted.\n\n![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/5F5Qj2Q.png)\n\n3. Contract the edge by merging vertices A and B into a single vertex, and find the chromatic polynomial of the resulting graph. This is P(G/e, k), where e is the edge we contracted.\n\n![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/5F5Qj2Q.png)\n\nNow, we have two simpler graphs to find the chromatic polynomial for. Let's start with the graph G-e:\n\n- The chromatic polynomial of G-e is P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\nNext, let's find the chromatic polynomial for the graph G/e:\n\n- The chromatic polynomial of G/e is P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n\nNow, we can use the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) - k(k-1)(k-2).\n\nFactor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)[(k-3) - 1] = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-4).\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G is:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-4)."
