    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation with the given initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the solution has the form:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on space, they must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$$\n$$T''(t) + c^2 \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution for the spatial ODE is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$$\n\nSince the solution must remain bounded as $x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty$, we can conclude that $A=0$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$X(x) = B\\sin(\\lambda x)$$\n\nThe general solution for the temporal ODE is:\n\n$$T(t) = C\\cos(c\\lambda t) + D\\sin(c\\lambda t)$$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for the wave equation as:\n\n$$u(x,t) = (B\\sin(\\lambda x))(C\\cos(c\\lambda t) + D\\sin(c\\lambda t))$$\n\nTo satisfy the initial conditions, we have:\n\n1. $u(x,0) = f(x) = B\\sin(\\lambda x)C = \\sin(\\pi x)$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = g(x) = B\\sin(\\lambda x)(c\\lambda D) = 0$\n\nFrom the first initial condition, we can see that $B=1$, $\\lambda = \\pi$, and $C=1$. The second initial condition implies that $D=0$. Therefore, the complex-valued solution for the given wave equation and initial conditions is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(c\\pi t)$$"
