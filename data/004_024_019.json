    "message_2": "To find $\\frac{dy}{dx}$, we'll differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$ using the chain rule.\n\nThe chain rule states that if $u$ is a function of $x$ and $v$ is a function of $u$, then the derivative of $v$ with respect to $x$ is given by:\n\n$\\frac{dv}{dx} = \\frac{dv}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dx}$\n\nApplying this to our equation:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) - \\frac{d}{dx}(xy) + \\frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \\frac{d}{dx}(9)$\n\nDifferentiating each term:\n\n$2x - (x\\frac{dy}{dx} + y) + 2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$\n\nNow, we'll solve for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n\n$2x - y + (2y - x)\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n\n$(2y - x)\\frac{dy}{dx} = y - 2x$\n\nFinally, divide both sides by $(2y - x)$ to get the derivative:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{y - 2x}{2y - x}$"
