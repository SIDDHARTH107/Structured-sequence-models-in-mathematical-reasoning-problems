    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we can use the fact that the order of a group is equal to the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The order of a group G is denoted as |G|.\n\nGiven that |G| = 40, we can factorize 40 as 2^3 * 5^1. Now, we will find the Sylow subgroups for the prime factors 2 and 5.\n\n1. For the prime factor 2 (p = 2):\n\nThe Sylow p-subgroup of G, P, has order 2^3 = 8. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_p, must divide the other factor of |G|, which is 5, and n_p ≡ 1 (mod 2). The only possibility for n_p is 1. This means there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8.\n\n2. For the prime factor 5 (p = 5):\n\nThe Sylow p-subgroup of G, Q, has order 5^1 = 5. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_p, must divide the other factor of |G|, which is 2^3 = 8, and n_p ≡ 1 (mod 5). The possibilities for n_p are 1 and 6. \n\nNow, we consider the possibilities for the Sylow 5-subgroups:\n\na) If there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup (n_p = 1), then both the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup are normal in G. In this case, G is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, G ≅ P × Q. Since there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 (up to isomorphism), and only one group of order 5 (up to isomorphism), there is only one group in this case.\n\nb) If there are six Sylow 5-subgroups (n_p = 6), then the Sylow 5-subgroups are not normal in G. In this case, G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 and six Sylow 5-subgroups of order 5. Since there are two groups of order 8 up to isomorphism (the cyclic group Z_8 and the dihedral group D_4), we need to consider both cases:\n\n- If the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to Z_8, then G has a unique structure, and there is one group in this case.\n- If the Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to D_4, then G has a unique structure, and there is one group in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 1 (case a) + 1 (case b, Z_8) + 1 (case b, D_4) = 3 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 40."
