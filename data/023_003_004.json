Assume that the rod is initially at a temperature of $u(x,0)=\\sin x$ and insulated so that no heat flows in or out at the ends. \n\nUse the method of Fourier series to solve the heat equation for $x \\in [0,\\pi]$ and $t>0$, with periodic boundary conditions $u(0,t)=u(\\pi,t)$ for all $t$. Find an expression for $u(x,t)$ using three terms in the Fourier series. If $k = 1$ and $t = \\pi$, what is the temperature $u(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\pi)$ at the point $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$?",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using Fourier series, we first assume that the solution can be written as a product of functions of $x$ and $t$, i.e., $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u(x,t)}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} \\Rightarrow X(x) \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = k T(t) \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2}$.\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $kXT$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{kT} \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}$.\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda$:\n\n$\\frac{1}{kT} \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}$.\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$ with boundary conditions $X(0) = X(\\pi) = 0$.\n2. $T'(t) + k\\lambda T(t) = 0$.\n\nFor the first equation, we consider the cases $\\lambda > 0$, $\\lambda = 0$, and $\\lambda < 0$. The only case that satisfies the boundary conditions is $\\lambda > 0$, which gives us the solutions:\n\n$X_n(x) = \\sin(nx)$, where $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$ and $\\lambda_n = n^2$.\n\nFor the second equation, we have:\n\n$T'(t) + k\\lambda_n T(t) = 0 \\Rightarrow T_n(t) = Ce^{-k\\lambda_n t}$.\n\nThus, the general solution is given by:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\sin(nx) e^{-k\\lambda_n t}$.\n\nTo find the coefficients $a_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin x$:\n\n$\\sin x = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\sin(nx)$.\n\nThis is a Fourier sine series, and the coefficients are given by:\n\n$a_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin x \\sin(nx) dx$.\n\nFor $n=1$, we have:\n\n$a_1 = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin x \\sin x dx = 1$.\n\nFor $n>1$, we have:\n\n$a_n = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin x \\sin(nx) dx = 0$.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin x e^{-k\\lambda_1 t}$.\n\nUsing three terms in the Fourier series, we have:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin x e^{-kt}$.\n\nNow, we are given $k = 1$ and $t = \\pi$. We want to find the temperature at $x = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$:\n\n$u\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\pi\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) e^{-\\pi} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} e^{-\\pi}$."
