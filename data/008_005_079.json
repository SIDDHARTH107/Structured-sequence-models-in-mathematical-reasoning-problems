    "message_2": "To solve the non-homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate z from the first two equations by adding them:\n\n(3x + 2y - z) + (4x - 3y + z) = 7 + 2\n7x - y = 9\ny = 7x - 9 (1)\n\nNow, we will eliminate z from the second and third equations:\n\n(4x - 3y + z) - 2(x + y + 2z) = 2 - 2(1)\n4x - 3y + z - 2x - 2y - 4z = 0\n2x - 5y + 3z = 0 (2)\n\nNow, we will substitute equation (1) into equation (2):\n\n2x - 5(7x - 9) + 3z = 0\n2x - 35x + 45 + 3z = 0\n-33x + 45 + 3z = 0\n3z = 33x - 45 (3)\n\nNow, we will substitute equation (1) into the third equation:\n\nx + (7x - 9) + 2z = 1\n8x - 9 + 2z = 1\n2z = -8x + 10 (4)\n\nNow, we will equate equations (3) and (4):\n\n33x - 45 = -8x + 10\n41x = 55\nx = 55/41\nx = 5/3\n\nNow, we will substitute the value of x into equation (1):\n\ny = 7(5/3) - 9\ny = 35/3 - 27/3\ny = 8/3\n\nFinally, we will substitute the values of x and y into equation (4):\n\n2z = -8(5/3) + 10\n2z = -40/3 + 30/3\n2z = -10/3\nz = -5/3\n\nSo, the solution to the non-homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 5/3, y = 8/3, and z = -5/3."
