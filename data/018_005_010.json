    "message_1": "Let A be a set of prime numbers less than 10 and B be the set of composite numbers less than 10. Find the intersection of A and B, and prove that the intersection of A and its complement is the empty set.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the sets A and B.\n\nA: Prime numbers less than 10 are {2, 3, 5, 7}.\nB: Composite numbers less than 10 are {4, 6, 8, 9}.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B, which means finding the elements that are common to both sets. Since prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have only two distinct positive divisors (1 and itself), and composite numbers have more than two distinct positive divisors, there cannot be any numbers that are both prime and composite. Therefore, the intersection of A and B is the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nNow, let's prove that the intersection of A and its complement is the empty set. The complement of A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. In this case, the universal set U is the set of all positive integers less than 10, which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. So, A' is the set of all elements in U that are not prime numbers, which is {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and A', which means finding the elements that are common to both sets. By definition, the complement of a set contains all elements not in the original set, so there cannot be any elements that are in both A and A'. Therefore, the intersection of A and A' is the empty set, denoted as ∅.\n\nIn conclusion, the intersection of A and B is the empty set, and the intersection of A and its complement is also the empty set."
