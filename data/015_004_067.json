    "message_2": "The primary bulb of the Mandelbrot set is the largest circular region centered at the origin, and it is also known as the cardioid. The boundary of this region is defined by the equation:\n\nr(θ) = 1 - cos(θ)\n\nwhere r is the radius and θ is the angle in polar coordinates.\n\nTo find the area of the primary bulb, we can integrate the square of the radius with respect to the angle from 0 to 2π:\n\nArea = 1/2 ∫[r(θ)]^2 dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nArea = 1/2 ∫(1 - cos(θ))^2 dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nTo solve this integral, we can expand the square and use the double-angle formula for cosine:\n\nArea = 1/2 ∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + cos^2(θ)) dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nArea = 1/2 ∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + 1/2(1 + cos(2θ))) dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\nArea = 1/2 [θ - 2sin(θ) + 1/4(θ + 1/2sin(2θ))] from 0 to 2π\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\nArea = 1/2 [(2π - 0) - 2(sin(2π) - sin(0)) + 1/4((2π - 0) + 1/2(sin(4π) - sin(0)))]\n\nArea = 1/2 (2π + 1/4(2π))\n\nArea = 1/2 (5/2π)\n\nArea = 5/4π\n\nSo, the area of the primary bulb of the Mandelbrot set is 5/4π or approximately 3.92699 square units."
