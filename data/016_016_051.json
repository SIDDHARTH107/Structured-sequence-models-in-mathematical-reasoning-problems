    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that can be constructed using a Lindenmayer system (L-system). The length of the Gosper curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (initial length) * (multiplier)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations, and the multiplier for the Gosper curve is approximately 2.2842712474619.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is the perimeter of an equilateral triangle with sides of 100 units each, which is 300 units.\n\nFor the 5th iteration, we can calculate the total length as follows:\n\nLength = 300 * (2.2842712474619)^5\nLength ≈ 300 * 95.0166307\nLength ≈ 28504.98921\n\nSo, the total length of the 5th iteration of the Gosper curve with an initial equilateral triangle of 100 units per side is approximately 28,504.99 units."
