    "message_2": "To find the largest angle in the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The largest angle is opposite the longest side, which is 9 in this case. Let's denote the angles as A, B, and C, where C is the largest angle (opposite the side with length 9).\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths, and C is the angle opposite side c. In this case, a = 7, b = 8, and c = 9.\n\n9^2 = 7^2 + 8^2 - 2 * 7 * 8 * cos(C)\n\n81 = 49 + 64 - 112 * cos(C)\n\n81 = 113 - 112 * cos(C)\n\n-32 = -112 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 32/112\n\nC = arccos(32/112)\n\nC ≈ 106.26°\n\nThe largest angle in the triangle is approximately 106.26 degrees."
