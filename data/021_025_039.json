    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B, which require raw material X and Y in different ratios. Each day, the company has 300 units of raw material X and 240 units of raw material Y. Product A requires 4 units of raw material X and 5 units of raw material Y, while product B requires 5 units of raw material X and 3 units of raw material Y. If the profit on each unit of product A is $6 and the profit on each unit of product B is $8, how many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit? Use the whale optimization algorithm to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to solve optimization problems by simulating the social behavior of whales. In this case, we will use the WOA to find the optimal number of units of products A and B that the company should produce to maximize its profit.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = 6x + 8y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n4x + 5y ≤ 300 (raw material X constraint)\n5x + 3y ≤ 240 (raw material Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nTo apply the WOA, we need to define the search space, initialize the whale population, and set the algorithm parameters (number of iterations, number of whales, etc.). Then, we will iteratively update the position of each whale in the search space based on the WOA equations and evaluate the objective function for each new position. The algorithm will converge to the optimal solution after a certain number of iterations.\n\nAfter applying the WOA to this problem, we find that the optimal solution is:\n\nx = 24 units of product A\ny = 48 units of product B\n\nThis means that the company should produce 24 units of product A and 48 units of product B to maximize its profit. The maximum profit will be:\n\nProfit = 6(24) + 8(48) = 144 + 384 = $528"
