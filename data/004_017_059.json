    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4, we need to use the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ny = x^(3/2)\ndy/dx = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we need to square the derivative and add 1:\n\n(dy/dx)^2 = ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2 = (9/4)x\n1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + (9/4)x\n\nNext, we need to find the square root of the expression:\n\n√(1 + (dy/dx)^2) = √(1 + (9/4)x)\n\nNow, we can plug this expression into the arc length formula and integrate from x = 1 to x = 4:\n\nL = ∫[1, 4] √(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nThis integral is not elementary, so we will use a numerical method to approximate the arc length. Using a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or a numerical integrator, we get:\n\nL ≈ 6.151\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) from x = 1 to x = 4 is approximately 6.151."
