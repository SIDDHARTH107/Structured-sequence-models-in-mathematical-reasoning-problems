    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 6. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 = 1. Let P be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since P is of order 3, it must be cyclic, so P = {e, a, a^2}, where e is the identity element and a has order 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 3. Let Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since Q is of order 2, it must be cyclic, so Q = {e, b}, where b has order 2.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, then G has a unique element of order 2, namely b. In this case, G = {e, a, a^2, b, ab, a^2b}. Since G has an element of order 6 (ab), G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3\nIf there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, then G has two more elements of order 2, say c and d. Note that c and d must be distinct from b and from each other. Since G has 6 elements, G = {e, a, a^2, b, c, d}. Now, let's consider the product of two elements of order 2, say bc. We have (bc)^2 = bcbc = bbcc = e, so bc has order 2. Since b, c, and d are the only elements of order 2 in G, we must have bc = d. Similarly, we can show that bd = c and cd = b.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, say ab. We have (ab)^2 = a^2b^2, and (ab)^3 = a^3b^3 = e. Since ab has order 3, G has two elements of order 3, namely a and ab. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 6 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3."
