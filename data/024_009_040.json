    "message_2": "The scalar curvature of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nScalar curvature (R) = 2 * (n - 1) * K\n\nwhere n is the dimension of the sphere (in this case, n = 3 for a 3-dimensional sphere) and K is the sectional curvature. For a sphere, the sectional curvature is given by:\n\nK = 1 / radius^2\n\nIn this case, the radius of the sphere is 5. So, the sectional curvature K is:\n\nK = 1 / 5^2 = 1 / 25\n\nNow, we can calculate the scalar curvature:\n\nR = 2 * (3 - 1) * (1 / 25) = 4 * (1 / 25) = 4 / 25\n\nTherefore, the scalar curvature of a sphere of radius 5 is 4/25 or 0.16."
