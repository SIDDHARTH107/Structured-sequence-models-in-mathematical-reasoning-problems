    "message_2": "To find the phase shift, amplitude, and period of the given function f(x) = 3cos(2x - π/3), we will analyze the function based on its general form:\n\nf(x) = A*cos(Bx - C)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C determines the phase shift.\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine function. In this case, A = 3. So, the amplitude is 3.\n\n2. Period: The period of the function is determined by the coefficient of x inside the cosine function. The general formula for the period of a cosine function is (2π)/B. In this case, B = 2. So, the period is (2π)/2 = π.\n\n3. Phase Shift: The phase shift is determined by the value of C in the general form of the function. The general formula for the phase shift is C/B. In this case, C = π/3 and B = 2. So, the phase shift is (π/3)/2 = π/6.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude is 3, the period is π, and the phase shift is π/6."
