    "message_1": "Suppose A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {3, 4}. Find the Cartesian product of A and (B ∩ {3}).",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the intersection of B and {3}. The intersection is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, the intersection is:\n\nB ∩ {3} = {3}\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian product of A and (B ∩ {3}). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set (A) and b is an element of the second set (B ∩ {3}). In this case, the Cartesian product is:\n\nA × (B ∩ {3}) = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}\n\nSo, the Cartesian product of A and (B ∩ {3}) is {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}."
