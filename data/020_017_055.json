    "message_1": "A metal sheet of dimensions 8 m by 10 m is to be made into a box without a lid by cutting equal squares at each corner and then folding up the sides. Determine the size of the squares cut out to maximize the volume of the box.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the squares cut out from each corner. After cutting the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be:\n\nLength: 10 - 2x\nWidth: 8 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume of the box, V, can be expressed as the product of its dimensions:\n\nV(x) = (10 - 2x)(8 - 2x)x\n\nExpanding the expression, we get:\n\nV(x) = 4x^3 - 36x^2 + 80x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of the function by taking the first derivative of V(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\nV'(x) = 12x^2 - 72x + 80\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n12x^2 - 72x + 80 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 4:\n\n3x^2 - 18x + 20 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(3x - 10)(x - 2) = 0\n\nThe possible values for x are:\n\nx = 10/3 â‰ˆ 3.33 m\nx = 2 m\n\nSince the width of the metal sheet is 8 m, cutting out squares of size 2 m would result in a box with no width. Therefore, we discard this solution.\n\nThus, the size of the squares cut out to maximize the volume of the box is approximately 3.33 meters."
