    "message_1": "A company manufactures electronic components and the probability of a defect in each component is 0.04. If the company produces 10,000 components, what is the probability that at least 400 of them will have a defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula or the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. In this case, we will use the normal approximation since the sample size is large (n = 10,000).\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution:\n\nμ = n * p = 10,000 * 0.04 = 400\nσ = √(n * p * (1 - p)) = √(10,000 * 0.04 * 0.96) ≈ 19.6\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that there are at least 400 defective components. Since we are using the normal approximation, we will find the z-score for 400:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ = (400 - 400) / 19.6 = 0\n\nHowever, we want the probability of at least 400 defects, so we need to find the area to the right of z = 0. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, the area to the right of z = 0 is 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least 400 components will have a defect is approximately 0.5 or 50%."
