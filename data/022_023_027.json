    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution u(x,t) can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on t:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we will substitute this into the given PDE:\n\n∂²u/∂t² = c²∂²u/∂x²\n=> X(x)T''(t) = c²X''(x)T(t)\n\nNext, we will separate the variables by dividing both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nT''(t)/T(t) = c²X''(x)/X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\nT''(t)/T(t) = c²X''(x)/X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1) T''(t) + λ²T(t) = 0\n2) X''(x) + (λ²/c²)X(x) = 0\n\nWe are given the initial conditions:\n\nu(x,0) = X(x)T(0) = sin(x)\n∂u/∂t(x,0) = X(x)T'(0) = 0\n\nFrom the first initial condition, we have T(0) = 1 (since X(x) = sin(x) at t=0). Now, we will solve the ODEs.\n\nFor equation (2), we have a standard eigenvalue problem for the Sturm-Liouville system. Since the problem is defined on the interval [0, π], the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are:\n\nλ_n = n, X_n(x) = sin(nx), n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we will solve equation (1) for each eigenvalue λ_n:\n\nT_n''(t) + n²T_n(t) = 0\n\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator equation with the general solution:\n\nT_n(t) = A_n cos(nt) + B_n sin(nt)\n\nUsing the initial condition T_n(0) = 1, we get A_n = 1. The second initial condition gives:\n\nX_n(x)T_n'(0) = sin(nx)(-nB_n) = 0\n\nSince sin(nx) is not always zero, we must have B_n = 0. Therefore, the solution for each mode is:\n\nu_n(x,t) = sin(nx)cos(nt)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a sum of these modes:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [sin(nx)cos(nt)]\n\nHowever, since we are given u(x,0) = sin(x), only the first mode (n=1) is non-zero:\n\nu(x,t) = sin(x)cos(t)\n\nSo, the solution for u(x,t) for t > 0, where c = 2 and x is in the range of [0,π] is:\n\nu(x,t) = sin(x)cos(t)"
