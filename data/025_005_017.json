    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by $f(x, y) = 0$, we need to find the points where the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ are both zero. \n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives of $f$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x + x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y - 1$\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$2x + x^2 = 0$\n\n$2y - 1 = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we get $y = \\frac{1}{2}$. Now, we substitute this value into the first equation:\n\n$2x + x^2 = 0$\n\n$x(2 + x) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for $x$: $x = 0$ and $x = -2$. Thus, we have two singular points: $(0, \\frac{1}{2})$ and $(-2, \\frac{1}{2})$."
