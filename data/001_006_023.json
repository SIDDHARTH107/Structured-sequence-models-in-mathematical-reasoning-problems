    "message_2": "To graph the quadratic equation y = x² + 2x - 3 and find the important points, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the vertex.\n2. Find the x-intercepts.\n3. Find the y-intercept.\n\n1. Find the vertex:\nThe vertex of a quadratic equation in the form y = ax² + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nVertex (h, k) = (-b/2a, f(-b/2a))\n\nIn our equation, a = 1, b = 2, and c = -3. So, we have:\n\nh = -b/2a = -2/(2*1) = -1\nk = f(-1) = (-1)² + 2(-1) - 3 = 1 - 2 - 3 = -4\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is (-1, -4).\n\n2. Find the x-intercepts:\nTo find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x² + 2x - 3\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (-2 ± √(2² - 4(1)(-3))) / 2(1)\nx = (-2 ± √(4 + 12)) / 2\nx = (-2 ± √16) / 2\nx = (-2 ± 4) / 2\n\nSo, we have two x-intercepts:\nx1 = (-2 + 4) / 2 = 1\nx2 = (-2 - 4) / 2 = -3\n\nThe x-intercepts are (1, 0) and (-3, 0).\n\n3. Find the y-intercept:\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 0² + 2(0) - 3\ny = -3\n\nThe y-intercept is (0, -3).\n\nIn summary:\n- The vertex of the parabola is (-1, -4).\n- The x-intercepts are (1, 0) and (-3, 0).\n- The y-intercept is (0, -3).\n\nNow, you can graph the parabola using these points and the general shape of a quadratic equation."
