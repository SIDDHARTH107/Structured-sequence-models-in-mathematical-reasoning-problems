    "message_2": "Since G has order 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. We are given that there exists an element a in G with order 6. \n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to C6\nSince there exists an element a with order 6, we can generate a cyclic group of order 6 with a as the generator. Let H = ⟨a⟩, then H is a cyclic subgroup of G with order 6. Since |H| = |G|, it follows that H = G. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 6, and G is isomorphic to C6.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to D3\nIf G is not isomorphic to C6, then there must be another element in G that is not in the cyclic subgroup generated by a. Let b be an element in G such that b is not in ⟨a⟩. Since a has order 6, the order of b cannot be 6, otherwise G would be isomorphic to C6. The possible orders of b are 2 or 3.\n\nIf the order of b is 2, then b^2 = e (identity element). Since G has order 6, there must be another element in G that is not in ⟨a⟩ or {e, b}. Let c = ab. Note that c is not in ⟨a⟩, since a has order 6 and c has b as a factor. Also, c ≠ b, since b is not in ⟨a⟩.\n\nNow, consider the elements e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, b, and c. We have 8 elements, but G has only 6 elements. Therefore, there must be some relations between these elements. We know that a^6 = e and b^2 = e. Since a and b are not in the same cyclic subgroup, it must be the case that (ab)^2 = e or (ab)^3 = e.\n\nIf (ab)^2 = e, then abab = e, which implies that ab = b^(-1)a^(-1). This is the relation for the dihedral group D3. Thus, G is isomorphic to D3.\n\nIf (ab)^3 = e, then (ab)(ab)(ab) = e. Since a has order 6 and b has order 2, we can rewrite this as a^3b^3 = e. But a^3 ≠ e and b^2 = e, so this case is not possible.\n\nTherefore, G must be isomorphic to either C6 or D3."
