    "message_2": "To find the global minimum value of the function f(x) = x^4 - 8x^2 + x + 2 over the interval [-2, 2], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, we find the first derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 16x + 1\n\nNow, we find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero:\n\n4x^3 - 16x + 1 = 0\n\nThis equation is difficult to solve analytically, so we can use numerical methods to approximate the critical points. Using a numerical solver, we find two critical points within the interval [-2, 2]:\n\nx ≈ -1.167\nx ≈ 0.834\n\nNow, we evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^4 - 8(-2)^2 + (-2) + 2 = 16 - 32 - 2 + 2 = -16\nf(-1.167) ≈ (-1.167)^4 - 8(-1.167)^2 + (-1.167) + 2 ≈ -5.844\nf(0.834) ≈ (0.834)^4 - 8(0.834)^2 + (0.834) + 2 ≈ -5.844\nf(2) = (2)^4 - 8(2)^2 + (2) + 2 = 16 - 32 + 2 + 2 = -12\n\nComparing the function values, we find that the global minimum value of the function over the interval [-2, 2] is approximately -5.844, which occurs at the critical points x ≈ -1.167 and x ≈ 0.834."
