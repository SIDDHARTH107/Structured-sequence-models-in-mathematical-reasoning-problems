    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x/(1-x) on the interval (-1,1), we first need to determine if the function is even or odd. Since f(-x) = -x/(1+x) ≠ f(x), the function is neither even nor odd. Therefore, we need to find both the cosine and sine coefficients.\n\nThe Fourier series of a function f(x) on the interval (-L, L) is given by:\n\nf(x) = (a_0)/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L)]\n\nwhere\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nIn our case, L = 1, so the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(x) = (a_0)/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(nπx) + b_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n.\n\na_0 = ∫[-1, 1] x/(1-x) dx\n\nThis integral is not convergent, so the function f(x) does not have a Fourier series representation on the interval (-1,1)."
