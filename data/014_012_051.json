    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Vigenere cipher with the key \"CODE\", we first need to repeat the key to match the length of the plaintext. In this case, the repeated key is \"CODECODECO\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere square (or tabula recta) to find the corresponding ciphertext for each character in the plaintext. The Vigenere square consists of 26 rows of shifted alphabets, where each row starts with a different letter of the alphabet.\n\nFor each character in the plaintext, we find the intersection of the row corresponding to the key character and the column corresponding to the plaintext character. The letter at this intersection is the encrypted character.\n\nHere's the encryption process for the given plaintext and key:\n\n1. M (plaintext) + C (key) = O (ciphertext)\n2. A + O = O\n3. T + D = W\n4. H + E = L\n5. E + C = G\n6. M + O = W\n7. A + D = D\n8. T + E = W\n9. I + C = K\n10. C + O = S\n11. S + C = V\n\nSo, the ciphertext for the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Vigenere key \"CODE\" is \"OOWLGWWDWKSV\"."
