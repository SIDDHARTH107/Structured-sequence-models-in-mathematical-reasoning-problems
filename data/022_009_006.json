    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence of the power series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n! z^n$, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that the radius of convergence $R$ is given by:\n\n$$R = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right|}$$\n\nIn our case, $a_n = n!$, so we have:\n\n$$R = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\left|\\frac{(n+1)!}{n!}\\right|}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression inside the absolute value:\n\n$$\\frac{(n+1)!}{n!} = \\frac{(n+1)n!}{n!} = n+1$$\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$$R = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{|n+1|}$$\n\nAs $n$ goes to infinity, the expression $|n+1|$ also goes to infinity, and therefore the limit goes to 0:\n\n$$R = 0$$\n\nThus, the radius of convergence of the power series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n! z^n$ is 0. This means that the series converges only at the single point $z = 0$."
