    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose the current price of a stock is $50, the strike price for a call option with expiration in 6 months is $60, and the annualized risk-free interest rate is 4%. Assume that the volatility of the stock price follows a stochastic process described by the Black-Scholes-Merton equation with initial volatility sigma(0) = 0.2 and parameters alpha = 0.3, beta = 0.5, and gamma = 0.1. What is the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula?",
    "message_2": "To find the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula, we need to calculate the following variables:\n\n1. Time to expiration (T): Since the expiration is in 6 months, T = 0.5 years.\n2. Risk-free interest rate (r): Given as 4%, or 0.04 in decimal form.\n3. Stock price (S): Given as $50.\n4. Strike price (K): Given as $60.\n5. Volatility (σ): Given as 0.2.\n\nNow, we can use the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to find the call option price (C):\n\nC = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere N(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and d1 and d2 are given by:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(50/60) + (0.04 + (0.2^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.2 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 ≈ -0.3829\n\nd2 = d1 - 0.2 * sqrt(0.5)\nd2 ≈ -0.5829\n\nNow, we can find the values of N(d1) and N(d2) using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator:\n\nN(d1) ≈ 0.3510\nN(d2) ≈ 0.2801\n\nFinally, we can calculate the call option price (C):\n\nC = 50 * 0.3510 - 60 * e^(-0.04 * 0.5) * 0.2801\nC ≈ 17.55 - 16.80\nC ≈ 0.75\n\nSo, the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula is approximately $0.75."
