    "message_1": "The curve of y = x^2 - x + 1 intersects the x-axis at two points A and B. A tangent line to the curve at point A has a slope of -5. What is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at point B?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the points A and B where the curve y = x^2 - x + 1 intersects the x-axis. Since the curve intersects the x-axis, the y-coordinate of points A and B is 0. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\n0 = x^2 - x + 1\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(1))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± √(1 - 4)) / 2\nx = (1 ± √(-3)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. This means that the curve y = x^2 - x + 1 does not intersect the x-axis at any point. Therefore, the given information is incorrect, and we cannot find the slope of the tangent line to the curve at point B."
