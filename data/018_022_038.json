    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A △ B) and (B △ A). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {2, 3, 5, 7} - {3, 5} = {2, 7}\nB △ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {2, 3, 5, 7} - {3, 5} = {2, 7}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A △ B) × A and (B △ A) × A. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A △ B) × A = {2, 7} × {2, 3, 5} = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5)}\n(B △ A) × A = {2, 7} × {2, 3, 5} = {(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5)}\n\nAs we can see, (A △ B) × A = (B △ A) × A, which means they are equal."
