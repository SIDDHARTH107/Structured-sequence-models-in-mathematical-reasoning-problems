    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the LU decomposition method, we first need to decompose the matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A = [[1, 2, -3], [2, 4, 1], [-3, 0, 1]], X = [[x], [y], [z]], and B = [[6], [4], [-1]].\n\nNow, let's find the L and U matrices.\n\n1. L = [[1, 0, 0], [l21, 1, 0], [l31, l32, 1]]\n2. U = [[u11, u12, u13], [0, u22, u23], [0, 0, u33]]\n\nUsing the LU decomposition method, we get:\n\nL = [[1, 0, 0], [2, 1, 0], [-3, 2, 1]]\nU = [[1, 2, -3], [0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 5]]\n\nNow, we will solve the system of linear equations in two steps:\n\n1. L * Y = B\n2. U * X = Y\n\nStep 1: Solving L * Y = B for Y\n\n1 * y1 = 6 => y1 = 6\n2 * y1 + 1 * y2 = 4 => y2 = -4\n-3 * y1 + 2 * y2 + 1 * y3 = -1 => y3 = 2\n\nSo, Y = [[6], [-4], [2]]\n\nStep 2: Solving U * X = Y for X\n\n1 * x1 + 2 * x2 - 3 * x3 = 6 => x1 = 2\n0 * x1 + 0 * x2 + 7 * x3 = -4 => x3 = -0.57 (rounded to two decimal places)\n0 * x1 + 0 * x2 + 5 * x3 = 2 => x2 = 1.71 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, X = [[2], [1.71], [-0.57]]\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 1.71, and z = -0.57 (rounded to two decimal places)."
