    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The given SDE is a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model, which has the following closed-form solution:\n\nX(t) = X(0) * exp((α - (σ^2)/2) * t + σ * W(t))\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n\nX(t) = 1 * exp((0.3 - (0.2^2)/2) * t + 0.2 * W(t))\n\nWe want to find the probability that X(2) >= 2. To do this, we can use the properties of the Wiener process and the fact that the logarithm of a GBM is normally distributed. Let Y(t) = ln(X(t)). Then, Y(t) is normally distributed with mean and variance given by:\n\nMean: μ_Y = ln(X(0)) + (α - (σ^2)/2) * t = ln(1) + (0.3 - (0.2^2)/2) * 2 = 0.3 * 2 = 0.6\nVariance: σ_Y^2 = (σ^2) * t = (0.2^2) * 2 = 0.08\n\nNow, we want to find the probability P(X(2) >= 2), which is equivalent to finding P(Y(2) >= ln(2)). We can standardize Y(2) by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:\n\nZ = (Y(2) - μ_Y) / σ_Y = (ln(2) - 0.6) / sqrt(0.08)\n\nNow, Z is a standard normal random variable. We can use the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the probability:\n\nP(Z >= (ln(2) - 0.6) / sqrt(0.08)) = 1 - P(Z <= (ln(2) - 0.6) / sqrt(0.08))\n\nUsing a standard normal table or a calculator, we can find the value of the CDF:\n\nP(Z <= (ln(2) - 0.6) / sqrt(0.08)) ≈ 0.7241\n\nTherefore, the probability that X(2) >= 2 is:\n\nP(X(2) >= 2) = 1 - 0.7241 ≈ 0.2759\n\nSo, there is approximately a 27.59% chance that X(2) will be greater than or equal to 2."
