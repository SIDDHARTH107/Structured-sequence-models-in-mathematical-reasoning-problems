    "message_1": "In a group of 20 students, the average score on a statistics exam was 85%. However, one student got a score of 50%. Is this score considered an outlier? Use the 1.5*IQR rule to determine if it is an outlier.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the score of 50% is an outlier using the 1.5*IQR rule, we first need to find the first quartile (Q1), the third quartile (Q3), and the interquartile range (IQR).\n\n1. Arrange the scores in ascending order, including the 50% score.\n2. Find the median (Q2) of the dataset. Since there are 20 students, the median will be the average of the 10th and 11th scores.\n3. Find Q1, which is the median of the lower half of the dataset (the first 10 scores).\n4. Find Q3, which is the median of the upper half of the dataset (the last 10 scores).\n5. Calculate the IQR: IQR = Q3 - Q1.\n6. Determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers: Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5*IQR, Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5*IQR.\n7. Check if the 50% score is below the lower bound or above the upper bound.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have the individual scores of the students. However, we can provide a general guideline for determining if the 50% score is an outlier based on the information given."
