    "message_1": "Consider an RLC circuit with a resistor of 10 Ohms, an inductor of 0.5 H, and a capacitor of 10 microfarads connected in series. Initially, the capacitor is charged to a potential difference of 12 volts. Find the charge on the capacitor at time t = 0.05 seconds if the circuit is made to oscillate with a frequency of 50 Hz by connecting it to an AC source. The voltage of the AC source is given by the function V(t) = 120 sin(2π50t).",
    "message_2": "To find the charge on the capacitor at time t = 0.05 seconds, we first need to find the impedance of the RLC circuit and the current in the circuit.\n\nThe impedance Z of the RLC circuit is given by:\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)\nwhere R is the resistance, XL is the inductive reactance, and XC is the capacitive reactance.\n\nXL = ωL = 2πfL = 2π(50)(0.5) = 50π\nXC = 1/(ωC) = 1/(2πfC) = 1/(2π(50)(10 * 10^(-6))) = 1/(10π * 10^(-4)) = 1000/π\n\nNow, we can find the impedance Z:\nZ = √((10)^2 + (50π - 1000/π)^2) ≈ 159.15 Ohms\n\nNext, we find the current in the circuit at time t = 0.05 seconds using the AC source voltage function V(t):\nV(0.05) = 120 sin(2π(50)(0.05)) = 120 sin(π) = 0 V\n\nSince the voltage across the AC source is 0 V at t = 0.05 seconds, the voltage across the capacitor must also be 0 V at this time.\n\nNow, we can find the charge Q on the capacitor using the formula Q = CV, where C is the capacitance and V is the voltage across the capacitor:\nQ = (10 * 10^(-6)) * 0 = 0 C\n\nSo, the charge on the capacitor at time t = 0.05 seconds is 0 C."
