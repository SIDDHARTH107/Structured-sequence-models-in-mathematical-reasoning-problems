    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve, and its total length increases with each order. The length of the Hilbert curve of order n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (number of segments) * (length of each segment)\n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order n, the number of segments is given by:\n\nNumber of segments = 4^n\n\nIn this case, we want to find the length of the Hilbert curve of order 4. So, we have:\n\nNumber of segments = 4^4 = 256\n\nSince each straight segment of the curve has a length of 1 unit, the total length of the Hilbert curve of order 4 is:\n\nLength = 256 * 1 = 256 units"
