    "message_2": "To find the probability of making at least 3 out of 5 free throws, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (5 free throws), k is the number of successful trials (at least 3), p is the probability of success (0.7), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nWe need to find the probability of making 3, 4, or 5 free throws and then add those probabilities together.\n\nFor 3 free throws:\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * 0.7^3 * (1-0.7)^(5-3) = 10 * 0.7^3 * 0.3^2 = 10 * 0.343 * 0.09 = 0.3087\n\nFor 4 free throws:\nP(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * 0.7^4 * (1-0.7)^(5-4) = 5 * 0.7^4 * 0.3^1 = 5 * 0.2401 * 0.3 = 0.36015\n\nFor 5 free throws:\nP(X = 5) = C(5, 5) * 0.7^5 * (1-0.7)^(5-5) = 1 * 0.7^5 * 0.3^0 = 1 * 0.16807 * 1 = 0.16807\n\nNow, add the probabilities together:\nP(X â‰¥ 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) = 0.3087 + 0.36015 + 0.16807 = 0.83692\n\nSo, the probability of making at least 3 out of 5 free throws is approximately 0.83692 or 83.69%."
