    "message_2": "To form a 5-letter sequence using the letters A, B, C, and D with repetition allowed, we have 4 choices for each of the 5 positions in the sequence.\n\nSo, the total number of 5-letter sequences that can be formed is:\n\n4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 4^5 = 1024\n\nTherefore, there are 1024 different 5-letter sequences that can be formed using the letters A, B, C, and D with repetition allowed."
