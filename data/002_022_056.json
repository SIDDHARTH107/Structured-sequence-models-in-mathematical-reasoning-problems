    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 6 cm and a minor radius of 4 cm. Find its volume.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the minor radius of the torus and major_radius is the major radius of the torus.\n\nGiven the major radius (R) is 6 cm and the minor radius (r) is 4 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * 4^2) * (2 * π * 6)\n\nVolume = (π * 16) * (12 * π)\n\nVolume = 192 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 192π^2 cubic centimeters."
