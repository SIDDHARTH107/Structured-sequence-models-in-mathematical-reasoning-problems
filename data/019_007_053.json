    "message_1": "Here's an example problem for a math student to solve based on non-monotonic logic:\n\nSuppose a restaurant serves three types of pizza: vegetarian, pepperoni, and mushroom. You order a vegetarian pizza, but later find out that the restaurant is out of vegetarian pizza. The waiter then tells you that they have a special \"house pizza\" which contains all three toppings (vegetarian, pepperoni, and mushroom). \n\nIf the logical principle of non-monotonic reasoning is applied, what can you conclude about the toppings on your pizza order when the waiter makes this offer?\n\nAnswer: If the restaurant is out of vegetarian pizza, and the waiter offers you the \"house pizza\" which contains vegetarian toppings, it is not necessarily true that you will receive a vegetarian pizza. The principle of non-monotonic reasoning allows for new information to change the original assumptions, and in this case, the addition of a new topping (pepperoni and/or mushroom) may change the conclusion about the toppings on your pizza order.",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, the initial assumption was that you would receive a vegetarian pizza. However, with the new information that the restaurant is out of vegetarian pizza and the waiter offers the \"house pizza\" containing all three toppings, the original assumption is no longer valid.\n\nApplying non-monotonic reasoning, we can conclude that the toppings on your pizza order will now include vegetarian, pepperoni, and mushroom toppings, as the waiter has offered the \"house pizza\" as an alternative. The new information has changed the original assumption, and it is now clear that you will not receive a purely vegetarian pizza."
