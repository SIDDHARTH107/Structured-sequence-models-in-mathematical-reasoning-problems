    "message_1": "One possible question for a math student to solve related to birational geometry and its applications is:\n\nGiven the equation of a rational curve in the projective plane, find its parametrization.\n\nFor example, consider the rational curve defined by the equation\n$$\nC: x^2 + y^2 = z^2.\n$$\nTo find a parametrization of this curve, we can use the fact that any rational curve in the projective plane can be written as the image of a map\n$$\n\\varphi : \\mathbb{P}^1 \\to \\mathbb{P}^2,\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{P}^1$ is the projective line and $\\mathbb{P}^2$ is the projective plane. The map $\\varphi$ is given by homogeneous coordinates as\n$$\n\\varphi([s : t]) = [s^2 - t^2 : 2st : s^2 + t^2].\n$$\nWe can check that the image of $\\varphi$ is contained in the curve $C$, and that every point on $C$ can be parametrized in this way. Therefore,\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\varphi([1 : t]) = [1 - t^2 : 2t : 1 + t^2]\n$$\nis a parametrization of $C$.",
    "message_2": "To further verify that this parametrization is correct, we can substitute the expressions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ from the parametrization $\\gamma(t)$ into the equation of the curve $C$:\n\n$$\n(1 - t^2)^2 + (2t)^2 = (1 + t^2)^2.\n$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$\n(1 - 2t^2 + t^4) + (4t^2) = (1 + 2t^2 + t^4).\n$$\n\nCancelling out the terms, we find that the equation holds true:\n\n$$\n1 - 2t^2 + t^4 + 4t^2 = 1 + 2t^2 + t^4.\n$$\n\nThus, the parametrization $\\gamma(t) = [1 - t^2 : 2t : 1 + t^2]$ is indeed a valid parametrization of the rational curve $C: x^2 + y^2 = z^2$."
