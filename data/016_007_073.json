    "message_1": "If the Menger sponge has an initial cube with a side length of 3 units, and the sponge is created by removing the smaller cubes in each iteration with a ratio of 1:3 compared to the larger cubes, how many cubes will be removed in the third iteration?",
    "message_2": "In the Menger sponge, at each iteration, we remove the middle one-ninth of each face and the central cube. In the first iteration, there are 6 faces and 1 central cube, so we remove 6 * (1/9) + 1 = 6/9 + 1 = 7 cubes.\n\nIn the second iteration, we apply the same process to each of the remaining 20 cubes from the first iteration. So, we remove 20 * 7 = 140 cubes.\n\nIn the third iteration, we apply the same process to each of the remaining 20 * 20 = 400 cubes from the second iteration. So, we remove 400 * 7 = 2800 cubes."
