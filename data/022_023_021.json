    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation with the given initial conditions, we can use the method of d'Alembert's formula. The general solution for the wave equation using d'Alembert's formula is:\n\nu(x, t) = (1/2) [f(x + ct) + f(x - ct)] + (1/2c) ∫(x-ct) to (x+ct) g(s) ds\n\nwhere f(x) = u(x, 0) and g(x) = u_t(x, 0).\n\nIn this problem, we have f(x) = sin(x) and g(x) = 0. Also, c = 2. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nu(x, t) = (1/2) [sin(x + 2t) + sin(x - 2t)] + (1/4) ∫(x-2t) to (x+2t) 0 ds\n\nSince g(x) = 0, the integral term becomes 0:\n\nu(x, t) = (1/2) [sin(x + 2t) + sin(x - 2t)]\n\nNow, we need to find the solution at time t = π/4:\n\nu(x, π/4) = (1/2) [sin(x + π/2) + sin(x - π/2)]\n\nThis is the solution to the given wave equation with the given initial conditions at time t = π/4."
