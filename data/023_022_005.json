    "message_1": "The question for the math student to solve is:\n\nThe daily closing price of a particular stock for the last 30 days is given in the form of a discrete-time signal. Calculate the Fourier transform of this signal and determine the frequency at which the stock appears to be oscillating the most during this time period.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the Fourier transform and how it can be applied to a discrete-time signal. The Fourier transform is a mathematical tool that helps us analyze the frequency components of a signal. In this case, we want to find the frequency at which the stock price oscillates the most during the 30-day period.\n\nSince we are given a discrete-time signal, we will use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to analyze the signal. The DFT is given by the formula:\n\nX(k) = Σ [x(n) * e^(-j * 2 * π * k * n / N)]\n\nwhere X(k) is the k-th frequency component, x(n) is the n-th sample of the signal, N is the total number of samples (30 in this case), and j is the imaginary unit (sqrt(-1)).\n\nTo find the frequency at which the stock oscillates the most, we need to calculate the magnitude of the DFT for each frequency component and find the maximum value. The magnitude of the DFT is given by:\n\n|X(k)| = sqrt(Re(X(k))^2 + Im(X(k))^2)\n\nwhere Re(X(k)) and Im(X(k)) are the real and imaginary parts of X(k), respectively.\n\nOnce we find the maximum magnitude, we can determine the corresponding frequency by:\n\nf_max = k_max * (f_s / N)\n\nwhere f_max is the frequency with the maximum magnitude, k_max is the index of the maximum magnitude, and f_s is the sampling frequency (1 day in this case).\n\nHowever, without the actual data of the daily closing prices, we cannot perform these calculations. If you provide the data, we can then proceed to find the frequency at which the stock oscillates the most during the 30-day period."
