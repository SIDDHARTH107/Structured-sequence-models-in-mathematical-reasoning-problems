    "message_1": "Suppose two players are deciding on how to split a prize of $100. Player 1 can choose to put in effort or shirk, and Player 2 cannot observe Player 1's effort level. If Player 1 puts in effort, the probability of winning the prize increases from 50% to 75%. However, exerting effort reduces Player 1's utility by $20 due to the cost of effort. If Player 1 shirks, they still have a 50% chance of winning the prize and suffer no costs. Player 2 receives a utility of $50 regardless of Player 1's effort. \nWhat is the expected utility for each player if Player 1 chooses to put in effort? What if Player 1 shirks? And what would be the rational choice for Player 1?",
    "message_2": "Let's calculate the expected utility for each player if Player 1 chooses to put in effort:\n\n1. Player 1 puts in effort:\n- Probability of winning: 75% (0.75)\n- Prize amount: $100\n- Cost of effort: $20\n\nExpected utility for Player 1 = (0.75 * $100) - $20 = $75 - $20 = $55\n\n2. Player 2:\n- Probability of winning: 25% (0.25)\n- Prize amount: $100\n\nExpected utility for Player 2 = 0.25 * $100 = $25\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected utility for each player if Player 1 chooses to shirk:\n\n1. Player 1 shirks:\n- Probability of winning: 50% (0.5)\n- Prize amount: $100\n- Cost of effort: $0\n\nExpected utility for Player 1 = 0.5 * $100 = $50\n\n2. Player 2:\n- Probability of winning: 50% (0.5)\n- Prize amount: $100\n\nExpected utility for Player 2 = 0.5 * $100 = $50\n\nNow, let's determine the rational choice for Player 1:\n\n- If Player 1 puts in effort, their expected utility is $55.\n- If Player 1 shirks, their expected utility is $50.\n\nSince the expected utility is higher when Player 1 puts in effort ($55 > $50), the rational choice for Player 1 is to put in effort."
