    "message_1": "A company wants to produce a rectangular box with a maximum volume using a rectangular cardboard of dimensions 20 cm by 30 cm. What should be the dimensions of the rectangular box to achieve the maximum volume possible?",
    "message_2": "To create a box from a rectangular cardboard, we will need to cut squares of equal size from each corner of the cardboard and then fold the sides up. Let's denote the side length of the square cut from each corner as x.\n\nAfter cutting the squares, the dimensions of the box will be:\nLength = 30 - 2x\nWidth = 20 - 2x\nHeight = x\n\nThe volume of the box can be calculated as:\nVolume = Length × Width × Height\nV(x) = (30 - 2x)(20 - 2x)x\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the volume function with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\nV'(x) = dV/dx = (20 - 4x)(30 - 2x) - 2(30 - 2x)(20 - 2x) + 2(20 - 2x)(30 - 2x) = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get two critical points: x = 5 and x = 2.5. We can use the second derivative test to determine which of these points corresponds to a maximum volume:\n\nV''(x) = 12x - 60\n\nV''(5) = -60 < 0, so x = 5 corresponds to a maximum volume.\nV''(2.5) = 0, so x = 2.5 is an inflection point.\n\nThus, the dimensions of the box that will yield the maximum volume are:\nLength = 30 - 2(5) = 20 cm\nWidth = 20 - 2(5) = 10 cm\nHeight = 5 cm"
