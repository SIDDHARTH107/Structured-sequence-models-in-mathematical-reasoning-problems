    "message_2": "Case 1: Order of a is 27\n\nIf the order of a is 27, then the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted by ⟨a⟩, has 27 elements. Since G has 27 elements, we have G = ⟨a⟩. Thus, G is a cyclic group of order 27. Every cyclic group of order 27 is isomorphic to C27, so G is isomorphic to C27.\n\nCase 2: Order of a is 3 or 9\n\nLet's assume the order of a is 3. (The case for order 9 can be handled similarly.) Since the order of a is 3, we have a³ = e. Let H = ⟨a⟩, then |H| = 3. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G divides the order of G, so the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1, 3, 9, and 27. Since G is not cyclic (otherwise the order of a would be 27), there must exist a subgroup of order 9.\n\nLet K be a subgroup of G with order 9. Since |H| = 3 and |K| = 9, we have |H| * |K| = 27, which is equal to the order of G. Now, we claim that H ∩ K = {e}. Suppose there exists an element b ≠ e in H ∩ K. Then the order of b must divide both |H| and |K|, which are 3 and 9, respectively. The only possibility is that the order of b is 3, but this contradicts our assumption that a is the only element of order 3 in G. Thus, H ∩ K = {e}.\n\nNow, consider the product HK = {hk | h ∈ H, k ∈ K}. Since |H| * |K| = |G| and H ∩ K = {e}, we have |HK| = |H| * |K| = 27. Thus, HK = G. Moreover, for any h ∈ H and k ∈ K, we have (hk)³ = h³k³ = e, since h³ = k³ = e. This implies that the order of hk is either 1 or 3. If the order of hk is 1 for all h ∈ H and k ∈ K, then G would be a cyclic group, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, there must exist some h ∈ H and k ∈ K such that the order of hk is 3.\n\nLet b = hk, where the order of b is 3. Then G = HK, and we can define a multiplication operation on G by (h₁k₁)(h₂k₂) = h₁bh₂k₂, where h₁, h₂ ∈ H and k₁, k₂ ∈ K. This operation is associative and has an identity element e. Moreover, every element in G has an inverse, so G is a group under this operation. Since the order of b is 3, this group is non-abelian.\n\nIn conclusion, if the order of a is 3 or 9, then G is isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 27."
