    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {2, 3, 4, 5}. Take the complement of set A and set B. Calculate the symmetric difference of (A ∪ B) and the complement of set B, then calculate the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) and the complement of set B. Show that the symmetric difference of (A ∪ B) and the complement of set B is not equal to the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) and the complement of set B, proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the union and symmetric difference of sets A and B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA Δ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A) = {1} ∪ {5} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of sets A and B. We need to define a universal set U that contains all elements in A and B. Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Then:\n\nA' (complement of A) = U - A = {5, 6, 7}\nB' (complement of B) = U - B = {1, 6, 7}\n\nNext, we'll find the symmetric differences of (A ∪ B) with B' and (A Δ B) with B':\n\n(A ∪ B) Δ B' = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 6, 7}) ∪ ({1, 6, 7} - {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) = {2, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {6, 7} = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\n(A Δ B) Δ B' = ({1, 5} - {1, 6, 7}) ∪ ({1, 6, 7} - {1, 5}) = {5} ∪ {6, 7} = {5, 6, 7}\n\nNow we can see that the symmetric difference of (A ∪ B) and the complement of set B is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, while the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) and the complement of set B is {5, 6, 7}. Since these two sets are not equal, this proves that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
