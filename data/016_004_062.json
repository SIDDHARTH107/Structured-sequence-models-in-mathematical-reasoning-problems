    "message_2": "To determine the values of c in the complex plane for which the sequence generated by iterating f(z) = z^2 - 0.75 starting with z = 0 remains bounded, we need to analyze the behavior of the function under iteration.\n\nLet z_n be the sequence generated by iterating f(z), i.e., z_n+1 = f(z_n) = z_n^2 - 0.75. We start with z_0 = 0, so z_1 = f(z_0) = -0.75. Now, we want to find the values of c for which this sequence remains bounded.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the function f_c(z) = z^2 + c, when iterated from z = 0, remains bounded. In our case, f(z) = z^2 - 0.75, so we can rewrite it as f_c(z) = z^2 + c, where c = -0.75.\n\nThe corresponding points on the Mandelbrot set are the points for which the sequence generated by iterating f_c(z) remains bounded. Since c = -0.75, we can find the corresponding points on the Mandelbrot set by analyzing the behavior of the function f_{-0.75}(z) = z^2 - 0.75.\n\nThe Julia set for a given complex number c is the set of points in the complex plane for which the sequence generated by iterating f_c(z) does not tend to infinity. The Julia set is connected if and only if c belongs to the Mandelbrot set.\n\nIn our case, since c = -0.75, we need to determine whether -0.75 belongs to the Mandelbrot set. If it does, then the Julia set for f_{-0.75}(z) will be connected, and if it does not, the Julia set will be disconnected.\n\nTo check whether -0.75 belongs to the Mandelbrot set, we can iterate f_{-0.75}(z) starting from z = 0 and see if the sequence remains bounded. We have:\n\nz_0 = 0\nz_1 = f_{-0.75}(z_0) = (-0.75)^2 - 0.75 = 0.5625 - 0.75 = -0.1875\nz_2 = f_{-0.75}(z_1) = (-0.1875)^2 - 0.75 = 0.03515625 - 0.75 = -0.71484375\nz_3 = f_{-0.75}(z_2) = (-0.71484375)^2 - 0.75 â‰ˆ 0.2607\n\nThe sequence appears to remain bounded, so -0.75 is likely to belong to the Mandelbrot set. Therefore, the Julia set for f_{-0.75}(z) is connected.\n\nIn summary, the values of c in the complex plane for which the sequence generated by iterating f(z) = z^2 - 0.75 starting with z = 0 remains bounded correspond to the points on the Mandelbrot set for c = -0.75. The Julia set for this function is connected, as -0.75 belongs to the Mandelbrot set."
