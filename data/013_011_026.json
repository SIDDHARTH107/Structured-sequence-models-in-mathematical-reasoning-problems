    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms in a market with the same cost function C(q) = 50q, where q is the quantity produced by each firm. The market demand function is P(Q) = 120 - Q, where Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. Assuming that the firms set their prices simultaneously and independently, what is the Nash equilibrium price in this Bertrand competition?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete by setting prices simultaneously and independently. Since both firms have the same cost function, they will produce at the same marginal cost. The marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the cost function with respect to quantity (q).\n\nC(q) = 50q\nMC = dC(q)/dq = 50\n\nIn a Bertrand competition, firms will set their prices equal to their marginal cost to maximize profits. Therefore, both firms will set their prices at P = MC = 50.\n\nNow, we need to find the total quantity produced by both firms (Q) at this price. We can use the market demand function to find this:\n\nP(Q) = 120 - Q\n50 = 120 - Q\nQ = 120 - 50\nQ = 70\n\nSince both firms have the same cost function and produce the same quantity, we can assume that they will produce half of the total quantity each:\n\nq1 = q2 = Q/2\nq1 = q2 = 70/2\nq1 = q2 = 35\n\nSo, each firm will produce 35 units at a price of 50. The Nash equilibrium price in this Bertrand competition is 50."
