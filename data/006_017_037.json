    "message_1": "A certain type of traffic accident occurs on a specific road with a probability of 0.05. If 40 cars travel on that road, what is the probability that at least one of them will be involved in that type of accident?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one car will be involved in an accident, we can first find the probability that none of the cars will be involved in an accident and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single car will not be involved in an accident is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the cars are independent of each other, the probability that all 40 cars will not be involved in an accident is (0.95)^40.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one car will be involved in an accident by subtracting the probability that none of the cars will be involved in an accident from 1:\n\nP(at least one accident) = 1 - P(no accidents) = 1 - (0.95)^40 â‰ˆ 0.87\n\nSo, the probability that at least one car will be involved in that type of accident is approximately 0.87 or 87%."
