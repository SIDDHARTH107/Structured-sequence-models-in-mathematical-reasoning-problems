    "message_1": "Consider a company that manufactures two products, A and B. The profit per unit of A is $20 and the profit per unit of B is $30. The company can produce a maximum of 500 units of A and 700 units of B per day. Additionally, the manufacturing process requires 3 hours of labor for each unit of A and 4 hours of labor for each unit of B. The company has a maximum of 2200 hours of labor available per day. Using simulated annealing method, determine the optimal production levels of A and B that maximize the company's profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we first need to define the objective function, constraints, and initial solution.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit P = 20A + 30B\nConstraints:\n1. A <= 500\n2. B <= 700\n3. 3A + 4B <= 2200 (labor constraint)\n\nLet's start with an initial solution, for example, A = 250 and B = 350.\n\nNow, we will follow the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n1. Set an initial temperature T and a cooling rate alpha (e.g., T = 1000, alpha = 0.99).\n2. Generate a random neighboring solution by slightly perturbing the current solution (e.g., A = A + random(-10, 10), B = B + random(-10, 10)).\n3. Check if the new solution satisfies the constraints. If not, discard it and generate another one.\n4. Calculate the difference in profit between the new solution and the current solution (delta_P = P_new - P_current).\n5. If delta_P > 0, accept the new solution. If delta_P < 0, accept the new solution with probability exp(delta_P / T).\n6. Update the temperature T = alpha * T.\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the temperature is below a certain threshold or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing algorithm, we will obtain an optimal (or near-optimal) solution for the production levels of A and B that maximize the company's profit. Note that the actual solution may vary depending on the random perturbations and the parameters chosen for the algorithm."
