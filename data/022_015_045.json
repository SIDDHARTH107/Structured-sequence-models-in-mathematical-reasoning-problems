    "message_2": "Yes, there exists a function $F(z)$ satisfying the given conditions. We can construct $F(z)$ using the Schwarz reflection principle.\n\nFirst, let's define a function $h(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$h(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z) & \\text{if } \\text{Im}(z) > 0 \\\\\n\\overline{f(\\overline{z})} & \\text{if } \\text{Im}(z) < 0\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is analytic in the upper half-plane and continuous on the real axis, we can apply the Schwarz reflection principle to extend $f(z)$ to the lower half-plane as an analytic function. Moreover, $h(z)$ is real-valued on the real axis because $f(z)$ is real-valued on the real axis.\n\nNow, let's define $F(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$F(z) = \\begin{cases}\nf(z) & \\text{if } \\text{Im}(z) \\geq 0 \\\\\nh(z) & \\text{if } \\text{Im}(z) < 0\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nWe can verify that $F(z)$ satisfies the given conditions:\n\n1. $F(z)$ is analytic in the closed upper half-plane $\\overline{\\mathbb{H}}$ because $f(z)$ is analytic in the upper half-plane and continuous on the real axis, and $h(z)$ is analytic in the lower half-plane and continuous on the real axis.\n\n2. $F(z) = f(z)$ for $\\text{Im}(z) > 0$ by definition.\n\n3. $F(z) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$ for $\\text{Im}(z) = 0$ because $h(z) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$ for $\\text{Im}(z) = 0$.\n\n4. To show that $F(z)$ is bounded in $\\overline{\\mathbb{H}}$, we can use the maximum modulus principle. Since $F(z)$ is analytic in the closed upper half-plane, it attains its maximum modulus on the boundary, which is the real axis. However, $F(z)$ is real-valued on the real axis, so its modulus is bounded by the maximum absolute value of $g(x)$ on $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, there exists $M > 0$ such that $|F(z)| \\leq M$ for all $z \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{H}}$.\n\nThus, there exists a function $F(z)$ satisfying the given conditions."
