The private key is 7, and the public key is (6,11). If the encrypted message is (19,12), what is the original message?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), we need to find the original point (x, y) on the curve that represents the message. We will use the given information to perform the decryption.\n\nGiven:\n- Elliptic curve equation: y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2 (mod 23)\n- Private key: d = 7\n- Public key: P = (6, 11)\n- Encrypted message: C = (19, 12)\n\nFirst, we need to find the point R such that R = d * C. In ECC, scalar multiplication is performed using point addition and point doubling operations.\n\n1. Calculate R = 7 * (19, 12) on the elliptic curve.\n\nTo do this, we will perform point addition and point doubling operations.\n\n1.1. Double (19, 12) to get 2 * (19, 12) = (8, 7).\n\n1.2. Add (8, 7) to (19, 12) to get 3 * (19, 12) = (20, 20).\n\n1.3. Add (20, 20) to (19, 12) to get 4 * (19, 12) = (14, 19).\n\n1.4. Double (14, 19) to get 8 * (19, 12) = (13, 10).\n\n1.5. Subtract (19, 12) from (13, 10) to get 7 * (19, 12) = (13, 13).\n\nNow we have R = (13, 13).\n\n2. Calculate the original message point M.\n\nTo find the original message point M, we need to subtract the public key point P from the point R.\n\nM = R - P = (13, 13) - (6, 11)\n\n2.1. Calculate the inverse of P: P_inv = (6, -11) = (6, 12) (mod 23).\n\n2.2. Add R and P_inv: M = (13, 13) + (6, 12) = (10, 6).\n\nSo, the original message point is M = (10, 6)."
