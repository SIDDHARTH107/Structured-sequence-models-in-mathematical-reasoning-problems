    "message_1": "Suppose two players are playing Ultimatum Game. Player 1 receives 20 tokens and offers to split them with player 2. If player 2 accepts, both get to keep the tokens according to the agreed split; if player 2 rejects, both get nothing. What is the minimum number of tokens player 1 should offer to player 2 so that player 2 will accept the offer?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, the minimum number of tokens player 1 should offer to player 2 so that player 2 will accept the offer depends on player 2's preferences and rationality. In a purely rational scenario, player 2 should accept any offer greater than 0 tokens, as receiving something is better than receiving nothing. Therefore, the minimum number of tokens player 1 should offer to player 2 in this case is 1 token. However, in real-life situations, people may have different preferences and may reject offers they perceive as unfair."
