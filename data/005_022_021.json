    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the scores in ascending order: 73, 75, 82, 85, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 99.\n\nTo find the median, we take the average of the middle two scores since there are an even number of scores: (85 + 86) / 2 = 85.5. So, the median score is 85.5.\n\nTo find the interquartile range (IQR), we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Since there are 10 scores, we can find Q1 by taking the median of the first 5 scores and Q3 by taking the median of the last 5 scores.\n\nQ1: (75 + 82) / 2 = 78.5\nQ3: (88 + 90) / 2 = 89\n\nNow, we can find the interquartile range by subtracting Q1 from Q3: IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 89 - 78.5 = 10.5.\n\nSo, the median score is 85.5 and the interquartile range is 10.5."
