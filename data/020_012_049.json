    "message_1": "A company wants to maximize its profits by producing and selling the optimal amount of a certain product. The production cost is determined by the following function: C(x) = 8000 + 50x + 0.5x^2, where x is the number of products produced. The selling price p(x) is given by p(x) = 300 - 0.1x. Determine the optimal number of products the company should produce to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we first need to find the profit function. The profit function, P(x), is the difference between the revenue function, R(x), and the cost function, C(x). The revenue function is the product of the selling price and the number of products produced, which is R(x) = p(x) * x.\n\nFirst, let's find the revenue function R(x):\nR(x) = p(x) * x = (300 - 0.1x) * x = 300x - 0.1x^2\n\nNow, let's find the profit function P(x):\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x) = (300x - 0.1x^2) - (8000 + 50x + 0.5x^2) = -0.6x^2 + 250x - 8000\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function. We do this by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\nP'(x) = d/dx(-0.6x^2 + 250x - 8000) = -1.2x + 250\n\nNow, set P'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n-1.2x + 250 = 0\n-1.2x = -250\nx = 250 / 1.2\nx ≈ 208.33\n\nSince the company cannot produce a fraction of a product, we need to check the profit for both 208 and 209 products:\n\nP(208) = -0.6(208)^2 + 250(208) - 8000 ≈ 2600\nP(209) = -0.6(209)^2 + 250(209) - 8000 ≈ 2604.4\n\nSince P(209) > P(208), the company should produce 209 products to maximize its profit."
