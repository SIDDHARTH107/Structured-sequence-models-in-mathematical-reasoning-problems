    "message_1": "Alicia and Ben play a game with a pile of 20 stones. They take turns removing either 1, 2, or 3 stones from the pile. The player who removes the last stone from the pile wins the game. If Alicia goes first, how many possible ways are there for her to guarantee a win?",
    "message_2": "To guarantee a win, Alicia needs to ensure that she leaves Ben with a multiple of 4 stones at some point during the game. This is because no matter how many stones Ben takes (1, 2, or 3), Alicia can always take enough stones to bring the total removed back to a multiple of 4. By doing this, Alicia ensures that she will be the one to take the last stone.\n\nTo achieve this, Alicia should aim to leave Ben with 16 stones after her first move. She can do this by taking either 1, 2, or 3 stones on her first turn. Let's consider each of these cases:\n\n1. Alicia takes 1 stone, leaving 19 stones in the pile. Ben can take 1, 2, or 3 stones. If Ben takes 1 stone, there will be 18 stones left, and Alicia can take 2 stones to leave 16 stones for Ben. If Ben takes 2 stones, there will be 17 stones left, and Alicia can take 1 stone to leave 16 stones for Ben. If Ben takes 3 stones, there will be 16 stones left, which is already a multiple of 4.\n\n2. Alicia takes 2 stones, leaving 18 stones in the pile. Ben can take 1, 2, or 3 stones. If Ben takes 1 stone, there will be 17 stones left, and Alicia can take 3 stones to leave 14 stones for Ben. If Ben takes 2 stones, there will be 16 stones left, which is already a multiple of 4. If Ben takes 3 stones, there will be 15 stones left, and Alicia can take 1 stone to leave 14 stones for Ben.\n\n3. Alicia takes 3 stones, leaving 17 stones in the pile. Ben can take 1, 2, or 3 stones. If Ben takes 1 stone, there will be 16 stones left, which is already a multiple of 4. If Ben takes 2 stones, there will be 15 stones left, and Alicia can take 3 stones to leave 12 stones for Ben. If Ben takes 3 stones, there will be 14 stones left, and Alicia can take 2 stones to leave 12 stones for Ben.\n\nIn each of these cases, Alicia can guarantee a win by leaving Ben with a multiple of 4 stones. Therefore, there are 3 possible ways for Alicia to guarantee a win."
