    "message_1": "A company wants to use RSA encryption to send a message securely. They choose two prime numbers, p = 17 and q = 19, and use e = 7 as the public key exponent. The message to be encrypted is 11. What is the encrypted message, and how would you decrypt it?",
    "message_2": "To use RSA encryption, we first need to compute the public key (n, e) and the private key (n, d). We are given p = 17, q = 19, and e = 7. \n\n1. Compute n = p * q:\nn = 17 * 19 = 323\n\n2. Compute the totient function φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1):\nφ(n) = (17 - 1) * (19 - 1) = 16 * 18 = 288\n\n3. Find the private key exponent d such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1:\nWe are given e = 7, so we need to find d such that (7 * d) % 288 = 1. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of e.\n\nAfter applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 247.\n\n4. Encrypt the message m = 11 using the public key (n, e):\nThe encrypted message c is calculated as c ≡ m^e (mod n).\nc ≡ 11^7 (mod 323)\nc ≡ 194781 (mod 323)\nc = 187\n\nThe encrypted message is 187.\n\n5. Decrypt the encrypted message c = 187 using the private key (n, d):\nThe decrypted message m is calculated as m ≡ c^d (mod n).\nm ≡ 187^247 (mod 323)\nm ≡ 11 (mod 323)\n\nThe decrypted message is 11, which is the original message.\n\nSo, the encrypted message is 187, and the decrypted message is 11."
