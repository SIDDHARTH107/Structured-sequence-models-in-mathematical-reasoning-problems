    "message_1": "Suppose there are 25 people planning to take a road trip together. The probability of any given person getting car sick on the trip is 0.3. What is the probability that at least 5 people will get car sick on the trip?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 people will get car sick, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring. In this case, we want to find the probability of at least 5 people getting car sick, which is equal to 1 minus the probability of 0 to 4 people getting car sick.\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to find the probability of k successes (car sick) in n trials (people) with a probability of success p:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also known as \"n choose k\".\n\nFor our problem, n = 25, p = 0.3, and we want to find the probability of 0 to 4 people getting car sick:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(25, 0) * 0.3^0 * (1-0.3)^(25-0)\nP(X = 1) = C(25, 1) * 0.3^1 * (1-0.3)^(25-1)\nP(X = 2) = C(25, 2) * 0.3^2 * (1-0.3)^(25-2)\nP(X = 3) = C(25, 3) * 0.3^3 * (1-0.3)^(25-3)\nP(X = 4) = C(25, 4) * 0.3^4 * (1-0.3)^(25-4)\n\nNow, we can calculate these probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.000006\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.000162\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.001944\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.012672\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.048674\n\nNext, we find the probability of 0 to 4 people getting car sick by summing these probabilities:\n\nP(0 to 4) ≈ 0.000006 + 0.000162 + 0.001944 + 0.012672 + 0.048674 ≈ 0.063458\n\nFinally, we use the complement rule to find the probability of at least 5 people getting car sick:\n\nP(at least 5) = 1 - P(0 to 4) ≈ 1 - 0.063458 ≈ 0.936542\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 people will get car sick on the trip is approximately 0.936542 or 93.65%."
