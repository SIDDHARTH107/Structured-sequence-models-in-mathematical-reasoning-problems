    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the substitution method, we first solve one of the equations for one of the variables. Let's solve the second equation for x:\n\nx - 2y = -5\nx = 2y - 5\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for x into the first equation:\n\n2(2y - 5) + 3y = 11\n\nNow, we simplify and solve for y:\n\n4y - 10 + 3y = 11\n7y - 10 = 11\n7y = 21\ny = 3\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = 2(3) - 5\nx = 6 - 5\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1 and y = 3."
