    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 5 < 13, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n2x + 5 - 5 < 13 - 5\n2x < 8\n\n2. Divide both sides of the inequality by 2:\n2x/2 < 8/2\nx < 4\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x < 4.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a number line and label it with numbers. Make sure to include the number 4.\n\n2. Since x < 4, we will use an open circle at 4 to indicate that 4 is not included in the solution.\n\n3. Shade the region to the left of the open circle at 4, indicating that all numbers less than 4 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n<---( )--->\n    4"
