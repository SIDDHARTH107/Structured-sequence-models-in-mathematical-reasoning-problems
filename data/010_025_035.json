    "message_1": "Consider the topological quantum field theory known as the Chern-Simons theory. Suppose we have a 3-manifold M with a boundary consisting of two disjoint tori, T1 and T2, and a gauge group G. Compute the partition function Z(M) for this theory. Assume that the level k of the Chern-Simons theory is a positive integer.",
    "message_2": "To compute the partition function Z(M) for the Chern-Simons theory on a 3-manifold M with boundary consisting of two disjoint tori T1 and T2, we will use the path integral formulation of the theory. The partition function is given by the path integral over all gauge field configurations A on M:\n\nZ(M) = ∫ [DA] exp(i * k * CS(A))\n\nwhere CS(A) is the Chern-Simons action, which is given by:\n\nCS(A) = (1/4π) ∫_M Tr(A ∧ dA + (2/3) A ∧ A ∧ A)\n\nHere, Tr denotes the trace in the representation of the gauge group G, and ∧ denotes the wedge product of differential forms.\n\nTo compute the path integral, we will use the technique of surgery, which allows us to cut M along the tori T1 and T2 and glue it back together in a different way. This will simplify the computation of the path integral by reducing it to a product of simpler path integrals over simpler 3-manifolds.\n\nLet M1 and M2 be the two 3-manifolds obtained by cutting M along T1 and T2, respectively. Then, the partition function Z(M) can be expressed as a product of partition functions Z(M1) and Z(M2) and a gluing factor:\n\nZ(M) = Z(M1) * Z(M2) * G(T1, T2)\n\nThe partition functions Z(M1) and Z(M2) can be computed using the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariants, which are topological invariants of 3-manifolds associated with the Chern-Simons theory. The gluing factor G(T1, T2) can be computed using the Verlinde formula, which expresses it as a sum over the irreducible representations of the gauge group G:\n\nG(T1, T2) = ∑_R S_{R1, R2} * S_{R1, R2}^*\n\nHere, S_{R1, R2} is the modular S-matrix, which is an important object in the study of conformal field theories, and R1 and R2 are the irreducible representations of G associated with T1 and T2, respectively.\n\nIn summary, to compute the partition function Z(M) for the Chern-Simons theory on a 3-manifold M with boundary consisting of two disjoint tori T1 and T2, one needs to compute the WRT invariants for the 3-manifolds M1 and M2 obtained by cutting M along T1 and T2, and the gluing factor G(T1, T2) using the Verlinde formula. The partition function is then given by the product of these factors:\n\nZ(M) = Z(M1) * Z(M2) * G(T1, T2)"
