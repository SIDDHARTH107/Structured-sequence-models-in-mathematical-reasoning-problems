    "message_1": "According to recent polls, the probability of candidate A winning the election in a certain country is 0.6. If the probability of candidate B winning is 0.3, what is the probability that neither candidate A nor candidate B will win the election?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that neither candidate A nor candidate B will win the election, we can use the complementary rule. The complementary rule states that the probability of an event not occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event occurring.\n\nIn this case, we need to find the probability of neither candidate A nor candidate B winning. First, we find the probability of either candidate A or candidate B winning. This is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.6 + 0.3 = 0.9\n\nNow, we can use the complementary rule to find the probability of neither candidate A nor candidate B winning:\n\nP(not A and not B) = 1 - P(A or B) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1\n\nSo, the probability that neither candidate A nor candidate B will win the election is 0.1 or 10%."
