    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 7, we will integrate the function with respect to x. \n\nThe antiderivative F(x) is given by:\n\nF(x) = ∫(3x^2 - 4x + 7) dx\n\nWe will integrate each term separately:\n\nF(x) = ∫(3x^2) dx - ∫(4x) dx + ∫(7) dx\n\nFor each term, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n is x^(n+1)/(n+1):\n\nF(x) = (3/3)x^(2+1) - (4/2)x^(1+1) + 7x^1\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nF(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration."
