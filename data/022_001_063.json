    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = z^2 - 1/(z-1) along the path from z=2 to z=3i, we first need to find a suitable path connecting these two points in the complex plane. A simple path to consider is a straight line segment connecting z=2 and z=3i. We can parameterize this path using a parameter t, where t varies from 0 to 1:\n\nz(t) = (1-t)(2) + t(3i) = 2(1-t) + 3ti.\n\nNow, we need to check if the function f(z) is analytic along this path. The function f(z) is analytic everywhere except at the point z=1, where the denominator becomes zero. Since the path from z=2 to z=3i does not pass through z=1, the function f(z) is analytic along this path.\n\nTo find the analytic continuation of f(z) along this path, we can substitute the parameterized path z(t) into the function f(z):\n\nf(z(t)) = (2(1-t) + 3ti)^2 - 1/(2(1-t) + 3ti - 1).\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression:\n\nf(z(t)) = (2 - 2t + 3ti)^2 - 1/(1 - 2t + 3ti).\n\nThis expression represents the analytic continuation of f(z) along the path from z=2 to z=3i."
