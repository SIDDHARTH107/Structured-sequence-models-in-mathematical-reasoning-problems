Calculate the penalty cost for each row and column by subtracting the smallest cost from the second smallest cost.\n2. Select the row or column with the highest penalty cost.\n3. Allocate the maximum possible amount of goods to the cell with the lowest cost in the selected row or column.\n4. Update the supply and demand values.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 until all demands are met.\n\nFollowing these steps, we get the following allocations:\n\n1.
