    "message_2": "To find all the isometries that preserve the metric of the surface M given by the equation z = x^2 + y^2, we first need to find the metric tensor of M. \n\nThe metric tensor is a matrix that describes the geometry of a surface and is used to calculate distances, angles, and other geometric properties. It is given by the matrix of dot products of the tangent vectors of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface M using the following parameterization:\n\nΦ(u, v) = (u*cos(v), u*sin(v), u^2), where u ∈ ℝ and v ∈ [0, 2π).\n\nNow, we need to find the tangent vectors of the surface M:\n\nΦ_u = (∂Φ/∂u) = (cos(v), sin(v), 2u)\nΦ_v = (∂Φ/∂v) = (-u*sin(v), u*cos(v), 0)\n\nNext, we compute the metric tensor g_ij:\n\ng_11 = Φ_u • Φ_u = (cos(v))^2 + (sin(v))^2 + (2u)^2 = 1 + 4u^2\ng_12 = Φ_u • Φ_v = -u*cos(v)*sin(v) + u*sin(v)*cos(v) = 0\ng_21 = Φ_v • Φ_u = 0 (since g_12 = g_21)\ng_22 = Φ_v • Φ_v = (-u*sin(v))^2 + (u*cos(v))^2 = u^2\n\nNow, the metric tensor g is given by:\n\ng = | 1 + 4u^2    0    |\n    |    0      u^2 |\n\nAn isometry is a transformation that preserves the metric tensor. In other words, if T is an isometry, then the metric tensor of the transformed surface T(M) must be the same as the metric tensor of M.\n\nFor the surface M given by z = x^2 + y^2, the isometries that preserve the metric tensor are:\n\n1. Translations along the z-axis: (x, y, z) → (x, y, z + c), where c is a constant.\n2. Rotations around the z-axis: (x, y, z) → (x*cos(θ) - y*sin(θ), x*sin(θ) + y*cos(θ), z), where θ is the angle of rotation.\n\nThese isometries preserve the metric tensor because they do not change the shape of the surface M, and they only involve transformations that keep the surface's geometry intact."
