    "message_2": "Yes, the conclusion R is valid. \n\nUsing the given statements P and Q, we can deduce the conclusion R through a logical argument. Since all whales are mammals (Q) and all mammals are warm-blooded (P), it follows that all whales must also be warm-blooded. Thus, the conclusion R is valid based on the premises P and Q."
