    "message_2": "The scaling factor of the Barnsley fern can be determined by multiplying the vertical stretch by the horizontal stretch. In this case, the vertical stretch is 85% (0.85) and the horizontal stretch is 60% (0.6). \n\nScaling factor = Vertical stretch × Horizontal stretch\nScaling factor = 0.85 × 0.6\nScaling factor = 0.51\n\nThe scaling factor of the Barnsley fern is 0.51 when the vertical stretch is 85% and the horizontal stretch is 60%."
