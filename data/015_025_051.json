    "message_2": "To find the maximum amplitude of a forced van der Pol oscillator, we can use the following formula:\n\nA_max = F_0 / sqrt((k - mω^2)^2 + (cω)^2)\n\nwhere:\nA_max is the maximum amplitude,\nF_0 is the amplitude of the driving force (2 in this case),\nk is the spring constant (k = mω_n^2, where ω_n is the natural frequency),\nm is the mass of the oscillator (not given, but we can assume it's 1 for simplicity),\nω is the driving frequency (4π in this case),\nc is the damping coefficient (0.5 in this case).\n\nFirst, we need to find the spring constant k:\n\nk = mω_n^2 = 1 * (2π)^2 = 4π^2\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nA_max = 2 / sqrt((4π^2 - 1*(4π)^2)^2 + (0.5*(4π))^2)\n\nA_max = 2 / sqrt((-12π^2)^2 + (2π)^2)\n\nA_max = 2 / sqrt(144π^4 + 4π^2)\n\nA_max ≈ 0.138\n\nSo, the maximum amplitude of the forced van der Pol oscillator is approximately 0.138."
