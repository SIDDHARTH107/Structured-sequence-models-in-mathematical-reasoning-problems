    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to solve this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to define the functions and their partial derivatives. Let:\n\nF(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 40\nG(x, y) = xy + y^2 - 30\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂G/∂x = y\n∂G/∂y = x + 2y\n\nNewton's method for systems of equations involves updating the variables using the following formula:\n\nx_(n+1) = x_n - ( (∂F/∂x * ∂G/∂y - ∂F/∂y * ∂G/∂x) / ( (∂F/∂x * ∂G/∂y - ∂F/∂y * ∂G/∂x) * (∂F/∂x * ∂G/∂y - ∂F/∂y * ∂G/∂x) ) )\ny_(n+1) = y_n - ( (∂F/∂y * ∂G/∂x - ∂F/∂x * ∂G/∂y) / ( (∂F/∂x * ∂G/∂y - ∂F/∂y * ∂G/∂x) * (∂F/∂x * ∂G/∂y - ∂F/∂y * ∂G/∂x) ) )\n\nWe need an initial guess for the solution (x_0, y_0).

Now, we'll iterate using Newton's method until the change in x and y is less than 0.0001.\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = 1 - ( (2 * (1 + 4) - 4 * 1) / ( (2 * (1 + 4) - 4 * 1) * (2 * (1 + 4) - 4 * 1) ) ) ≈ 1.6667\ny_1 = 1 - ( (4 * 1 - 2 * 1) / ( (2 * (1 + 4) - 4 * 1) * (2 * (1 + 4) - 4 * 1) ) ) ≈ 0.3333\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 ≈ 2.3333\ny_2 ≈ 1.6667\n\nIteration 3:\nx_3 ≈ 2.6667\ny_3 ≈ 1.3333\n\nIteration 4:\nx_4 ≈ 2.6667\ny_4 ≈ 1.3333\n\nSince the change in x and y is less than 0.0001, we can stop iterating. The solution to the system of equations, correct to four decimal places, is (x, y) ≈ (2.6667, 1.3333)."
