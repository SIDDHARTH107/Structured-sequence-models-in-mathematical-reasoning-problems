    "message_1": "A student is designing a rectangular garden that will use a fence on three sides and a straight wall on one side. The student has 50 meters of fence material and 20 meters of wall material. Find the dimensions of the rectangular garden that yield the maximum area.",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the wall be x meters and the width of the garden be y meters. Since the wall is on one side and the fence is on the other three sides, we can write the constraint equation as:\n\nx + 2y = 50 (since the student has 50 meters of fence material)\n\nNow, we need to find the dimensions that yield the maximum area. The area of the rectangular garden can be represented as:\n\nArea = x * y\n\nWe can solve the constraint equation for x and substitute it into the area equation:\n\nx = 50 - 2y\n\nArea = (50 - 2y) * y = 50y - 2y^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area equation with respect to y and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Area)/dy = 50 - 4y = 0\n\nSolving for y:\n\n4y = 50\ny = 12.5\n\nNow, we can plug this value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 50 - 2(12.5) = 25\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular garden that yield the maximum area are 25 meters for the length of the wall (x) and 12.5 meters for the width (y)."
