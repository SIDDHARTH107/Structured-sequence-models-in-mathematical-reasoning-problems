    "message_2": "Polya's Enumeration Theorem is used to count the number of distinct ways to partition a set into groups under some symmetry conditions. In this case, we want to divide 25 students into 5 groups of 5 students each.\n\nFirst, let's consider the number of ways to arrange the 25 students in a row. This is simply 25! (25 factorial) ways.\n\nNow, we need to account for the symmetry in the problem. Since there are 5 groups of 5 students each, there is a cyclic symmetry of order 5. This means that we can rotate the groups, and the arrangement will still be considered the same.\n\nTo apply Polya's Enumeration Theorem, we need to compute the cycle index polynomial for the symmetric group acting on the set of students. In this case, the symmetric group is the cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C_5.\n\nThe cycle index polynomial for C_5 is given by:\n\nP_C5(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) = (x_1^5 + x_2^2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5)/5\n\nNow, we need to substitute x_i = (y^i) for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, where y is the number of students in each group (in this case, y = 5).\n\nP_C5(y, y^2, y^3, y^4, y^5) = (y^5 + (y^2)^2 + y^3 + y^4 + y^5)/5\n\nP_C5(5, 25, 125, 625, 3125) = (3125 + 625 + 125 + 625 + 3125)/5\n\nP_C5(5, 25, 125, 625, 3125) = (6625)/5\n\nP_C5(5, 25, 125, 625, 3125) = 1325\n\nSo, there are 1325 distinct ways to divide the 25 students into 5 groups of 5 students each using Polya's Enumeration Theorem."
