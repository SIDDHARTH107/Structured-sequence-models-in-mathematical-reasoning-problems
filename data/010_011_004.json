    "message_2": "To show that M is either a connected sum of tori or a prime manifold, we will use the Prime Decomposition Theorem for 3-manifolds. The Prime Decomposition Theorem states that every compact, connected, orientable 3-manifold without boundary can be uniquely decomposed as a connected sum of prime 3-manifolds.\n\nA 3-manifold is called prime if it cannot be written as a connected sum of two non-trivial 3-manifolds. A torus is a prime 3-manifold, as it cannot be decomposed further.\n\nNow, let M be a compact, connected, orientable 3-manifold without boundary. By the Prime Decomposition Theorem, we can write M as a connected sum of prime 3-manifolds:\n\nM = P_1 # P_2 # ... # P_n\n\nwhere P_i are prime 3-manifolds and # denotes the connected sum operation.\n\nWe want to show that M is either a connected sum of tori or a prime manifold. If n = 1, then M is already a prime manifold, and we are done. So, let's consider the case when n > 1.\n\nIn this case, we will show that each of the prime 3-manifolds P_i is a torus. Suppose, for contradiction, that one of the prime 3-manifolds, say P_1, is not a torus. Then, P_1 must have a non-trivial fundamental group, since the fundamental group of a torus is abelian and non-trivial.\n\nHowever, the connected sum operation implies that the fundamental group of M is the free product of the fundamental groups of the prime 3-manifolds:\n\nπ_1(M) = π_1(P_1) * π_1(P_2) * ... * π_1(P_n)\n\nSince π_1(P_1) is non-trivial, the fundamental group of M is non-trivial as well. But this contradicts the fact that M is a connected sum of tori, as the fundamental group of a connected sum of tori is abelian and non-trivial.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that P_1 is not a torus must be false, and each of the prime 3-manifolds P_i must be a torus. Hence, M is a connected sum of tori.\n\nIn conclusion, M is either a connected sum of tori or a prime manifold, as required."
