If the total Chern class of $E$ is $c(E) = 1 + p_1 + p_2$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the first and second Pontryagin classes of $E$ respectively, then what is the value of $p_2(M)$, the integral of $p_2$ over $M$?",
    "message_2": "Since $M$ is a 2-dimensional manifold, the only non-trivial cohomology class that can be integrated over $M$ is a 2-dimensional class. The Pontryagin classes $p_1$ and $p_2$ are 4-dimensional and 8-dimensional classes, respectively. Therefore, their integrals over $M$ will be zero, as they cannot be paired with the fundamental class of $M$.\n\nSo, the value of $p_2(M)$, the integral of $p_2$ over $M$, is 0."
