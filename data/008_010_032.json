    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The given system of equations can be represented as the following augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  7 ]\n[ 2 -3  2 | -11]\n[-1  1 -3 | -6 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Add the first row multiplied by -2 to the second row, and add the first row to the third row.\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  7 ]\n[ 0 -7  4 | -25]\n[ 0  3 -4 |  1 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -7.\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  7 ]\n[ 0  1 -4/7 | 25/7]\n[ 0  3 -4 |  1 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Subtract the second row multiplied by 2 from the first row, and subtract the second row multiplied by 3 from the third row.\n\n```\n[ 1  0  5/7 | -11/7]\n[ 0  1 -4/7 | 25/7]\n[ 0  0  0 | -16 ]\n```\n\nSince the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = -16, which is a contradiction, there is no solution to this system of linear equations. The system is inconsistent."
