The number of infected people at time t (in days) is given by the differential equation:\n\ndy/dt = (0.03)y(1000-y)\n\nwhere y(0) = 100 and y(t) represents the number of infected people at time t.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of infected people during the epidemic, and at what time does it occur?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of infected people during the epidemic, we need to analyze the given differential equation:\n\ndy/dt = (0.03)y(1000-y)\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the differential equation as a separable equation:\n\ndy/y(1000-y) = 0.03 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/y(1000-y)) dy = ∫0.03 dt\n\nTo solve the integral on the left side, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Let:\n\n1/y(1000-y) = A/y + B/(1000-y)\n\nMultiplying both sides by y(1000-y), we get:\n\n1 = A(1000-y) + B(y)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by choosing appropriate values for y:\n\ny = 0: 1 = 1000A => A = 1/1000\n\ny = 1000: 1 = 1000B => B = 1/1000\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n∫(1/1000)(1/y + 1/(1000-y)) dy = ∫0.03 dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n(1/1000)(ln|y| - ln|1000-y|) = 0.03t + C\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition y(0) = 100:\n\n(1/1000)(ln|100| - ln|900|) = C\n\nC = (1/1000)(ln(1/9))\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\n(1/1000)(ln|y| - ln|1000-y|) = 0.03t + (1/1000)(ln(1/9))\n\nTo find the maximum number of infected people, we can find the critical points by setting dy/dt = 0:\n\n0 = (0.03)y(1000-y)\n\nThis occurs when y = 0 or y = 1000. However, y = 0 is the minimum number of infected people, so we are interested in y = 1000.\n\nNow, we need to find the time t when y = 1000. We can plug y = 1000 into our equation:\n\n(1/1000)(ln|1000| - ln|0|) = 0.03t + (1/1000)(ln(1/9))\n\nSince ln|0| is undefined, we can't directly solve for t. However, we can infer that as the number of infected people approaches 1000, the time t approaches infinity. This means that the maximum number of infected people during the epidemic is 1000, and it occurs as time goes to infinity."
