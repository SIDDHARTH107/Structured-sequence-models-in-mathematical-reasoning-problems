    "message_2": "In the Sierpinski pyramid (also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron), each iteration involves replacing each pyramid with four smaller pyramids. The number of small pyramids at each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of pyramids = 4^n\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the third iteration:\n\nNumber of pyramids = 4^3 = 4 * 4 * 4 = 64\n\nSo, on the third iteration of constructing the Sierpinski pyramid, there will be 64 small pyramids present."
