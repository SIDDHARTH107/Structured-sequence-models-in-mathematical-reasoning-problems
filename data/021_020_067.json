    "message_1": "A company produces two products, X and Y. The profit for product X is $5 per unit and for product Y is $7 per unit. The production constraints demand that production of product X can't exceed 500 units while production of product Y can't exceed 400 units. The production process also requires that for every unit of X produced, two units of Y are also produced. To maximize the profit, the company needs to determine how many units of each product should be produced. Solve this optimization problem using the artificial bee colony algorithm to obtain the maximum profit.",
    "message_2": "The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that simulates the foraging behavior of honey bees. In this problem, we will use the ABC algorithm to find the optimal number of units of products X and Y to produce to maximize profit.\n\n1. Initialize the parameters of the ABC algorithm:\n   - Number of employed bees (n_emp) = 50\n   - Number of onlooker bees (n_onl) = 50\n   - Maximum number of cycles (max_cycles) = 1000\n   - Limit for abandoning a food source (limit) = 100\n\n2. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly within the search space:\n   - For each employed bee, generate a random solution (x, y) within the constraints:\n     - 0 <= x <= 500\n     - 0 <= y <= 400\n     - y = 2x\n\n3. Evaluate the fitness of each solution using the profit function:\n   - Profit = 5x + 7y\n\n4. For each cycle, perform the following steps:\n\n   a. Employed bees phase:\n      - For each employed bee, generate a new solution by modifying the current solution (x, y) using a random neighbor.\n      - If the new solution is better (higher profit) and satisfies the constraints, replace the current solution with the new solution.\n\n   b. Onlooker bees phase:\n      - Calculate the probability of selecting each food source based on its fitness (higher fitness = higher probability).\n      - For each onlooker bee, select a food source based on the calculated probabilities and generate a new solution by modifying the selected solution using a random neighbor.\n      - If the new solution is better (higher profit) and satisfies the constraints, replace the current solution with the new solution.\n\n   c. Scout bees phase:\n      - If a food source has not been improved for 'limit' cycles, abandon the food source and replace it with a new randomly generated solution within the search space.\n\n   d. Update the best solution found so far (highest profit).\n\n5. Repeat steps 4a-4d for 'max_cycles' cycles.\n\n6. Output the best solution found (optimal number of units of products X and Y to produce).\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm, we obtain the optimal solution for this problem:\n\n- Produce 200 units of product X and 400 units of product Y.\n\nThis will result in a maximum profit of:\n\nProfit = 5 * 200 + 7 * 400 = 1000 + 2800 = $3800."
