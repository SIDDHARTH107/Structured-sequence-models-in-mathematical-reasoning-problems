    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, using two resources, X and Y. Each unit of product A requires 5 units of resource X and 10 units of resource Y, while each unit of product B requires 2 units of resource X and 4 units of resource Y. The company has 120 units of resource X and 200 units of resource Y available for production. The selling price of product A is $20 per unit and the selling price of product B is $15 per unit. The company wants to maximize its total revenue. How many units of each product should the company produce?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of units of product A produced as a and the number of units of product B produced as b. The company's constraints can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n5a + 2b ≤ 120 (resource X constraint)\n10a + 4b ≤ 200 (resource Y constraint)\n\nThe company wants to maximize its total revenue, which can be represented by the following equation:\n\nRevenue = 20a + 15b\n\nTo find the optimal production levels, we will first solve the constraint inequalities for the feasible region:\n\n5a + 2b ≤ 120\n2b ≤ 120 - 5a\nb ≤ 60 - 2.5a\n\n10a + 4b ≤ 200\n4b ≤ 200 - 10a\nb ≤ 50 - 2.5a\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of these inequalities, which is:\n\nb ≤ 60 - 2.5a\nb ≤ 50 - 2.5a\na ≥ 0\nb ≥ 0\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. (a, b) = (0, 0)\n2. Intersection of b = 60 - 2.5a and b = 50 - 2.5a: No intersection since they are parallel lines.\n3. (a, b) = (0, 50 - 2.5*0) = (0, 50)\n4. (a, b) = (120/5, 0) = (24, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the revenue function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. Revenue(0, 0) = 20*0 + 15*0 = $0\n2. Revenue(0, 50) = 20*0 + 15*50 = $750\n3. Revenue(24, 0) = 20*24 + 15*0 = $480\n\nThe maximum revenue is achieved when producing 0 units of product A and 50 units of product B, resulting in a total revenue of $750."
