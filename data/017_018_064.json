    "message_2": "By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 32. Since P is a p-group, its center Z(P) is nontrivial. Let x be an element of Z(P) with order 2. Then, the centralizer of x in G, C_G(x), contains Z(P), so |C_G(x)| is divisible by 2. Since x has order 2, the index of C_G(x) in G is also divisible by 2. By the Orbit-Stabilizer theorem, the number of elements of order 2 in G is equal to the index of C_G(x) in G, which is divisible by 2.\n\nNow, let's count the number of elements of order 2 in P. Since P is a group of order 32, it is a 2-group, and by the classification of finite abelian groups, we know that P is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. Z_32\n2. Z_16 × Z_2\n3. Z_8 × Z_4\n4. Z_8 × Z_2 × Z_2\n5. Z_4 × Z_4 × Z_2\n6. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2\n7. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2\n\nIn each case, we can count the number of elements of order 2:\n\n1. Z_32 has 1 element of order 2.\n2. Z_16 × Z_2 has 2 elements of order 2.\n3. Z_8 × Z_4 has 4 elements of order 2.\n4. Z_8 × Z_2 × Z_2 has 4 elements of order 2.\n5. Z_4 × Z_4 × Z_2 has 4 elements of order 2.\n6. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 has 8 elements of order 2.\n7. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 has 16 elements of order 2.\n\nSince the number of elements of order 2 in G is equal to the number of elements of order 2 in P, we can conclude that G contains 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 elements of order 2."
