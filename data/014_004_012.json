    "message_1": "Here is an example problem for a math student to solve in elliptic curve cryptography:\n\nSuppose we have an elliptic curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$. We also have a base point $P=(2,3)$ and a secret key $k=4$. Compute the public key $Q=kP$. Hint: use point addition and doubling formulas.\n\nCan you solve for the value of the public key $Q$?",
    "message_2": "To compute the public key $Q=kP$, we need to perform point addition and doubling on the elliptic curve. Since $k=4$, we need to compute $Q=2(2P)$.\n\nFirst, let's compute $2P$. To do this, we'll use the point doubling formula:\n\n$\\lambda = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1} \\mod p$\n\n$\\nu = \\frac{-x_1^3 + \\lambda(x_1^2 - x_2) - y_1}{2} \\mod p$\n\nwhere $P=(x_1, y_1)$, $a=2$, and $p=7$.\n\nFor $P=(2,3)$, we have:\n\n$\\lambda = \\frac{3(2)^2 + 2}{2(3)} \\mod 7 = \\frac{16}{6} \\mod 7 = \\frac{2}{-1} \\mod 7 = 2 \\cdot 6 \\mod 7 = 12 \\mod 7 = 5$\n\nNow, we can compute the coordinates of $2P=(x_2, y_2)$:\n\n$x_2 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_1 \\mod p = 5^2 - 2 - 2 \\mod 7 = 21 \\mod 7 = 0$\n\n$y_2 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_2) - y_1 \\mod p = 5(2 - 0) - 3 \\mod 7 = 7 \\mod 7 = 0$\n\nSo, $2P=(0,0)$.\n\nNow, we need to compute $Q=2(2P) = 4P$. Since $2P=(0,0)$, we can use the point doubling formula again:\n\n$\\lambda = \\frac{3(0)^2 + 2}{2(0)} \\mod 7$\n\nHowever, the denominator is $0$, which means that the point at infinity is reached. In elliptic curve cryptography, the point at infinity serves as the identity element for the group operation. Therefore, $Q=4P$ is the point at infinity, which is usually denoted as $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nSo, the public key $Q$ is the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$."
