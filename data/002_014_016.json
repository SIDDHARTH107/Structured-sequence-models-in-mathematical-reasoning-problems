    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 16 cm, a width of 7 cm and a height of 5 cm. Find the surface area of the prism in square centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of one pair of opposite faces (length x width): 16 cm * 7 cm = 112 square centimeters. Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 * 112 = 224 square centimeters.\n\n2. The area of the second pair of opposite faces (length x height): 16 cm * 5 cm = 80 square centimeters. Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 * 80 = 160 square centimeters.\n\n3. The area of the third pair of opposite faces (width x height): 7 cm * 5 cm = 35 square centimeters. Since there are two of these faces, their total area is 2 * 35 = 70 square centimeters.\n\nNow, we add the total areas of all three pairs of faces: 224 + 160 + 70 = 454 square centimeters.\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 454 square centimeters."
