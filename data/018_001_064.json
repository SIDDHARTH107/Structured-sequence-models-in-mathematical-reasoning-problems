    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set {} is a subset of set A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of set A.\n\nBy definition, the empty set has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A. Since there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A, it is trivially true that every element in the empty set is also an element of set A.\n\nThus, the empty set {} is a subset of set A."
