    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2x - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 2x\n\nx^2 = x\n\nx(x - 1) = 0\n\nx = 0 or x = 1\n\nSo the points of intersection are (0, 0) and (1, 1).\n\nNow we can set up the integral to find the area between the curves. We will integrate the difference between the two functions from x = 0 to x = 1:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - x^2 - x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 2x^2) dx from 0 to 1\n\nNow we can find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\nAntiderivative = x^2 - (2/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow we can evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of integration:\n\nArea = [x^2 - (2/3)x^3] from 0 to 1\n\nArea = (1^2 - (2/3)(1)^3) - (0^2 - (2/3)(0)^3)\n\nArea = (1 - (2/3)) - (0)\n\nArea = 1/3\n\nSo the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2 is 1/3 square units."
