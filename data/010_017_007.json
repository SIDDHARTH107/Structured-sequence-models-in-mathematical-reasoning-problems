    "message_2": "First, let's recall the Morse inequalities for a smooth function $f: M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ on a compact smooth manifold $M$ without boundary:\n\n$$h_k - h_{k-1} + \\cdots + (-1)^k \\chi(M) \\geq 0$$\n\nwhere $h_k$ is the number of critical points of index $k$, and $\\chi(M)$ is the Euler characteristic of $M$.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with no critical points outside of a closed and bounded subset $D\\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. Since $D$ is closed and bounded, it is compact. We can think of $D$ as a compact smooth manifold with boundary. Let $M = D$ in the Morse inequalities above. The Euler characteristic of a compact smooth manifold with boundary is given by:\n\n$$\\chi(M) = 1 - g(M)$$\n\nwhere $g(M)$ is the genus of $M$. Thus, the Morse inequalities for $f$ restricted to the subset $D$ are:\n\n$$h_0(D) - h_1(D) + h_2(D) \\geq 1 - g(D)$$\n\nNow, let's determine the Morse inequalities for $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$, where $D$ is the closed unit disk centered at the origin. The function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ has only one critical point, which is the minimum at the origin $(0,0)$. The Hessian matrix of $f$ is:\n\n$$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the Hessian are both positive, so the index of the critical point is $0$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$h_0(D) = 1, \\quad h_1(D) = 0, \\quad h_2(D) = 0$$\n\nThe genus of the closed unit disk is $0$, since it is simply connected. Thus, the Morse inequalities for $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ restricted to the closed unit disk are:\n\n$$h_0(D) - h_1(D) + h_2(D) \\geq 1 - g(D) \\Rightarrow 1 - 0 + 0 \\geq 1 - 0$$\n\nwhich is true."
