    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations with complex coefficients, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n2(x + 2y + 3iz) = 2(4 + 2i)\n1(2x - y + 4z) = 1(3 + 3i)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2x + 4y + 6iz = 8 + 4i\n2x - y + 4z = 3 + 3i\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(2x + 4y + 6iz) - (2x - y + 4z) = (8 + 4i) - (3 + 3i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n5y + 6iz - 4z = 5 + i\n\nNow, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the third equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal:\n\n3(x + 2y + 3iz) = 3(4 + 2i)\n1(3x + 4iy - 2z) = 1(2 - i)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3x + 6y + 9iz = 12 + 6i\n3x + 4iy - 2z = 2 - i\n\nNow, subtract the third equation from the first equation:\n\n(3x + 6y + 9iz) - (3x + 4iy - 2z) = (12 + 6i) - (2 - i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n6y + 9iz + 4iy - 2z = 10 + 7i\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n5y + 6iz - 4z = 5 + i\n6y + 9iz + 4iy - 2z = 10 + 7i\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 5 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal:\n\n6(5y + 6iz - 4z) = 6(5 + i)\n5(6y + 9iz + 4iy - 2z) = 5(10 + 7i)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n30y + 36iz - 24z = 30 + 6i\n30y + 45iz + 20iy - 10z = 50 + 35i\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(30y + 45iz + 20iy - 10z) - (30y + 36iz - 24z) = (50 + 35i) - (30 + 6i)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n9iz + 20iy + 14z = 20 + 29i\n\nNow, let's divide the equation by 9i:\n\nz + (20/9)i*y + (14/9) = (20 + 29i) / 9i\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = ((20 + 29i) / 9i) - (20/9)i*y - (14/9)\n\nz = (29/9) - (20/9)i - (20/9)i*y\n\nNow we can substitute the value of z back into the equation 5y + 6iz - 4z = 5 + i:\n\n5y + 6i((29/9) - (20/9)i - (20/9)i*y) - 4((29/9) - (20/9)i - (20/9)i*y) = 5 + i\n\nSolving for y:\n\ny = (1/3) + (4/3)i\n\nNow we can substitute the values of y and z back into the first equation x + 2y + 3iz = 4 + 2i:\n\nx + 2((1/3) + (4/3)i) + 3i((29/9) - (20/9)i - (20/9)i*((1/3) + (4/3)i)) = 4 + 2i\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = (2/3) - (2/3)i\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = (2/3) - (2/3)i\ny = (1/3) + (4/3)i\nz = (29/9) - (20/9)i - (20/9)i*((1/3) + (4/3)i)"
