    "message_2": "To prove that 7 is a prime number using the proof by contradiction method, we will assume the opposite of our statement, which is that 7 is not a prime number. If 7 is not a prime number, then it must have factors other than 1 and itself.\n\nLet's assume that 7 can be factored into two integers, a and b, such that:\n\n7 = a * b\n\nSince 7 is an odd number, both a and b must be odd numbers as well (because the product of two even numbers is even, and the product of an even and an odd number is also even). Therefore, we can write:\n\na = 2m + 1\nb = 2n + 1\n\nwhere m and n are integers.\n\nNow, let's substitute these expressions for a and b back into our original equation:\n\n7 = (2m + 1) * (2n + 1)\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n7 = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we have:\n\n6 = 4mn + 2m + 2n\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the right side of the equation:\n\n3 = 2(mn + m + n)\n\nSince the left side of the equation is an odd number (3), and the right side of the equation is an even number (2 times the quantity of mn + m + n), we have reached a contradiction. This means that our initial assumption that 7 is not a prime number must be false.\n\nTherefore, we have proven by contradiction that 7 is a prime number, as it cannot be factored into two integers other than 1 and itself."
