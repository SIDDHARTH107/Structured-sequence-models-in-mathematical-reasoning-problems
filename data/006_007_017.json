    "message_1": "Suppose the current price of a stock is $100 and its probability of increasing to $120 is 0.3 and the probability of decreasing to $80 is 0.5. What is the probability that the price of the stock will remain unchanged?",
    "message_2": "Let P(unchanged) be the probability that the price of the stock will remain unchanged. Since there are only three possible outcomes (increasing, decreasing, or remaining unchanged), the sum of the probabilities of these three outcomes should be equal to 1.\n\nP(increasing) + P(decreasing) + P(unchanged) = 1\n\nWe are given the probabilities of increasing and decreasing:\n\nP(increasing) = 0.3\nP(decreasing) = 0.5\n\nNow we can solve for P(unchanged):\n\n0.3 + 0.5 + P(unchanged) = 1\n\n0.8 + P(unchanged) = 1\n\nP(unchanged) = 1 - 0.8\n\nP(unchanged) = 0.2\n\nTherefore, the probability that the price of the stock will remain unchanged is 0.2 or 20%."
