    "message_2": "To find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π/2, we first need to find the antiderivative of sin(x). The antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x). Now we will evaluate the definite integral:\n\n∫(sin(x) dx) from 0 to π/2 = [-cos(x)] from 0 to π/2\n\nNow we will plug in the limits of integration:\n\n[-cos(π/2)] - [-cos(0)]\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0 and cos(0) = 1, the expression becomes:\n\n[0] - [-1]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n1\n\nSo, the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π/2 is 1."
