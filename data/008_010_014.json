    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its reduced row echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 1  1  2 |  8  |\n| 2  3  4 | 20  |\n| 4  5  6 | 32  |\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row.\n\n| 1  1   2 |  8  |\n| 0  1   0 |  4  |\n| 0  1  -2 |  0  |\n\nStep 2: Subtract the second row from the third row.\n\n| 1  1   2 |  8  |\n| 0  1   0 |  4  |\n| 0  0  -2 | -4  |\n\nStep 3: Divide the third row by -2.\n\n| 1  1   2 |  8  |\n| 0  1   0 |  4  |\n| 0  0   1 |  2  |\n\nStep 4: Subtract 2 times the third row from the first row, and add the third row to the second row.\n\n| 1  1  0 |  4  |\n| 0  1  1 |  6  |\n| 0  0  1 |  2  |\n\nStep 5: Subtract the second row from the first row.\n\n| 1  0 -1 | -2  |\n| 0  1  1 |  6  |\n| 0  0  1 |  2  |\n\nNow, we can read the solution from the reduced row echelon form:\n\nx = -2, y = 6, z = 2"
