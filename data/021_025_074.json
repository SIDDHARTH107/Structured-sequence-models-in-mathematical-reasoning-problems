    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize the cost of producing a product by adjusting the amount of two different raw materials used in the production process. Raw material A costs $5 per unit and raw material B costs $8 per unit. The production process requires at least 6 units of raw material A and 3 units of raw material B. The company can purchase a maximum of 40 units of raw material A and 25 units of raw material B. Using the whale optimization algorithm, what is the minimum cost of producing one unit of the product?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the whale optimization algorithm, we need to define the objective function and constraints. The objective function is the cost of producing one unit of the product, which is the sum of the costs of raw materials A and B. The constraints are the minimum and maximum amounts of raw materials A and B that can be used in the production process.\n\nObjective function: Minimize C = 5A + 8B\n\nConstraints:\n1. A >= 6 (at least 6 units of raw material A)\n2. B >= 3 (at least 3 units of raw material B)\n3. A <= 40 (maximum of 40 units of raw material A)\n4. B <= 25 (maximum of 25 units of raw material B)\n\nThe whale optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that simulates the social behavior of humpback whales. It is an iterative process that searches for the best solution in the search space by updating the positions of the whales. However, it is not suitable for solving this linear programming problem directly.\n\nInstead, we can use a more appropriate method, such as the simplex method or graphical method, to find the optimal solution.\n\nUsing the graphical method, we can plot the constraints on a graph and find the feasible region. The vertices of the feasible region are the potential optimal solutions. By evaluating the objective function at each vertex, we can find the minimum cost.\n\nVertices of the feasible region:\n1. (6, 3)\n2. (6, 25)\n3. (40, 3)\n4. (40, 25) (not feasible due to constraint 4)\n\nEvaluating the objective function at each vertex:\n1. C(6, 3) = 5(6) + 8(3) = 30 + 24 = 54\n2. C(6, 25) = 5(6) + 8(25) = 30 + 200 = 230\n3. C(40, 3) = 5(40) + 8(3) = 200 + 24 = 224\n\nThe minimum cost is $54 when using 6 units of raw material A and 3 units of raw material B. Therefore, the minimum cost of producing one unit of the product is $54."
