    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we need to consider the divisors of the order of G, which is 10. The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. For each divisor, we will find the corresponding cyclic subgroup generated by an element of G.\n\n1. The subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup {1}, which is cyclic since it only contains the identity element.\n\n2. The subgroups of order 2 can be generated by elements of order 2. In G, the elements of order 2 are 5 (since 5 + 5 = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 10)). The cyclic subgroup generated by 5 is {1, 5}, which is a subgroup of G.\n\n3. The subgroups of order 5 can be generated by elements of order 5. In G, the elements of order 5 are 2 and 8 (since 2^5 = 32 ≡ 1 (mod 10) and 8^5 = 32768 ≡ 1 (mod 10)). The cyclic subgroups generated by 2 and 8 are {1, 2, 4, 6, 8} and {1, 8, 6, 4, 2}, respectively. Both of these subgroups are isomorphic and are subgroups of G.\n\n4. The subgroup of order 10 is G itself, which is cyclic since it is generated by the element 1 (or any other element of order 10, such as 3, 7, or 9).\n\nNow, we have found all the subgroups of G: {1}, {1, 5}, {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}, {1, 8, 6, 4, 2}, and G itself. All of these subgroups are cyclic, as they are generated by a single element. Therefore, every subgroup of G is cyclic."
