Suppose that the inverse image of each point on S^1 consists of exactly k points, where k is a positive integer. Prove that the fundamental group of X is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order k. \n\nAssuming the student has the necessary background in algebraic topology, this problem can be solved by constructing a covering space of S^1 with k sheets, and then applying the theory of covering spaces to calculate the fundamental group of X. The answer will confirm the student's understanding of both the fundamental group and covering spaces in topology.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the theory of covering spaces and the fundamental group.\n\nFirst, let's construct a covering space of S^1 with k sheets. Consider the map p: ℝ → S^1 defined by p(t) = e^(2πit), where t is a real number. This map is a universal covering map, and ℝ is the universal covering space of S^1. Now, let's define an equivalence relation on ℝ by saying that t1 ~ t2 if and only if t1 - t2 is an integer multiple of k. We can then form the quotient space ℝ/~, which is a covering space of S^1 with k sheets.\n\nNow, let's consider the composition of maps g: X → ℝ/~ → S^1, where the first map is the quotient map and the second map is the covering map. Since f: X → S^1 is given to be a continuous map with the inverse image of each point on S^1 consisting of exactly k points, we can lift f to a map f': X → ℝ/~ such that g = f' * p.\n\nNow, we will use the lifting criterion for covering spaces. Let x0 be a point in X, and let x1, x2, ..., xk be the k points in the inverse image of f(x0). Then, the induced homomorphism f_*: π_1(X, x0) → π_1(S^1, f(x0)) is surjective, since f is onto.\n\nFurthermore, the kernel of f_* is the image of the induced homomorphism (f')_*: π_1(X, x0) → π_1(ℝ/~, f'(x0)). Since ℝ/~ is a covering space of S^1 with k sheets, the fundamental group of ℝ/~ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order k, denoted by Z_k.\n\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, we have that π_1(X, x0) / ker(f_*) ≅ im(f_*). Since f_* is surjective, im(f_*) = π_1(S^1, f(x0)), and ker(f_*) = im((f')_*). Therefore, we have π_1(X, x0) / im((f')_*) ≅ π_1(S^1, f(x0)).\n\nSince π_1(S^1, f(x0)) is isomorphic to Z (the integers), and im((f')_*) is isomorphic to Z_k, we have π_1(X, x0) / Z_k ≅ Z. This implies that the fundamental group of X, π_1(X, x0), is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order k, as desired."
