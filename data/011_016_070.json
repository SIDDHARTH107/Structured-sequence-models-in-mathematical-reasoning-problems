    "message_1": "A designer is planning a seating arrangement for a banquet with 10 guests. There are 5 circular tables that can each seat 4 people. In how many ways can the guests be seated at the tables?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the number of ways to assign the 10 guests to the 5 tables. We can use the stars and bars method to do this. We have 10 guests (stars) and 4 dividers (bars) to separate them into 5 groups (tables). So, we have a total of 14 positions to place the stars and bars.\n\nWe can choose 4 positions for the dividers out of the 14 positions, which can be done in C(14, 4) ways, where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from n items. So, C(14, 4) = 14! / (4! * (14-4)!) = 1001 ways to assign the guests to the tables.\n\nNow, we need to consider the seating arrangements at each table. Since the tables are circular, we need to divide by the number of seats to account for the rotational symmetry. For a table with k guests, there are (k-1)! ways to arrange the guests.\n\nLet's consider the possible cases for the number of guests at each table:\n\n1. Two tables with 4 guests each, and three tables with 0 guests:\nFor each table with 4 guests, there are (4-1)! = 3! = 6 ways to arrange the guests. Since there are 2 such tables, there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 ways to arrange the guests at these tables.\n\n2. One table with 4 guests, two tables with 2 guests each, and two tables with 0 guests:\nFor the table with 4 guests, there are (4-1)! = 3! = 6 ways to arrange the guests. For each table with 2 guests, there are (2-1)! = 1! = 1 way to arrange the guests. Since there are 2 such tables, there are a total of 6 * 1 * 1 = 6 ways to arrange the guests at these tables.\n\n3. Four tables with 2 guests each, and one table with 0 guests:\nFor each table with 2 guests, there are (2-1)! = 1! = 1 way to arrange the guests. Since there are 4 such tables, there are a total of 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1 way to arrange the guests at these tables.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways to assign the guests to the tables (1001) by the number of ways to arrange the guests at the tables for each case, and then sum up the results for all cases:\n\n1. Two tables with 4 guests each, and three tables with 0 guests: 1001 * 36 = 36036\n2. One table with 4 guests, two tables with 2 guests each, and two tables with 0 guests: 1001 * 6 = 6006\n3. Four tables with 2 guests each, and one table with 0 guests: 1001 * 1 = 1001\n\nTotal number of ways to seat the guests = 36036 + 6006 + 1001 = 43043"
