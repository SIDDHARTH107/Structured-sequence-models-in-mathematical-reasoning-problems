    "message_1": "A group of six friends are planning a road trip and have decided to take turns driving their car. Each person will drive for 1 hour before switching with another friend. What is the probability that Sarah will be driving during the 4th hour of the trip?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that Sarah will be driving during the 4th hour of the trip, we need to consider the total number of possible driving orders and the number of orders in which Sarah is driving during the 4th hour.\n\nThere are 6 friends, so there are 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange the driving order. 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720 possible driving orders.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where Sarah is driving during the 4th hour. Since Sarah is fixed in the 4th position, we only need to arrange the remaining 5 friends in the other 5 positions. There are 5! (5 factorial) ways to do this. 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 possible orders with Sarah driving during the 4th hour.\n\nThe probability that Sarah will be driving during the 4th hour is the number of favorable orders divided by the total number of possible orders:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable orders) / (Total number of possible orders)\nProbability = 120 / 720\nProbability = 1/6 or approximately 0.1667\n\nSo, the probability that Sarah will be driving during the 4th hour of the trip is 1/6 or approximately 16.67%."
