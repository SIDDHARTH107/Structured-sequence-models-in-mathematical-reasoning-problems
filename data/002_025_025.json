    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the lengths of the two equal sides are 10 cm each. If the length of the third side of the triangle is 12 cm less than twice the length of the equal sides, what is the length of the third side?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the third side be x. According to the problem, the length of the third side is 12 cm less than twice the length of the equal sides. So, we can write the equation:\n\nx = 2 * 10 - 12\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 20 - 12\nx = 8\n\nSo, the length of the third side is 8 cm."
