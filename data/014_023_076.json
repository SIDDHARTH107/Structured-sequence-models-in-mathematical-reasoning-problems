    "message_1": "Suppose you intercept a Rail fence cipher message that was encrypted by writing it diagonally over a number of rows, and you know that the message has a length of 24 characters. If the cipher was written over 4 rows, what is the length of each row of the original message?",
    "message_2": "In a Rail fence cipher with 4 rows, the message is written diagonally in a zigzag pattern. To determine the length of each row of the original message, we need to analyze the pattern of the zigzag.\n\nThe first and last rows will have one character in every full cycle of the zigzag, while the middle rows will have two characters in every full cycle. A full cycle consists of going from the top row to the bottom row and back up to the second row (excluding the first row). In this case, a full cycle covers 4 + (4 - 2) = 6 characters.\n\nSince the message has a length of 24 characters, there are 24 / 6 = 4 full cycles. Now, let's calculate the number of characters in each row:\n\n- First row: 1 character per cycle * 4 cycles = 4 characters\n- Second row: 2 characters per cycle * 4 cycles = 8 characters\n- Third row: 2 characters per cycle * 4 cycles = 8 characters\n- Fourth row: 1 character per cycle * 4 cycles = 4 characters\n\nSo, the length of each row of the original message is 4, 8, 8, and 4 characters, respectively."
