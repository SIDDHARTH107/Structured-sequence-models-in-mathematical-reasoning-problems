    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first eliminate the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is 10 in this case.\n\n10 * (2x + 3) / 5 = 10 * (7x - 1) / 10\n\nNow, we can cancel out the denominators:\n\n2 * (2x + 3) = 1 * (7x - 1)\n\nNow, distribute the constants:\n\n4x + 6 = 7x - 1\n\nNext, we will isolate the variable x by moving all the x terms to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side:\n\n4x - 7x = -1 - 6\n\n-3x = -7\n\nNow, divide by -3 to solve for x:\n\nx = -7 / -3\n\nx = 7/3"
