    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (Central Angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere r is the radius and the central angle is in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 7 units and the central angle is 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (60 / 360) × π × 7²\n\nArea = (1/6) × π × 49\n\nArea = 49π/6\n\nThe area of the sector is (49π/6) square units."
