    "message_2": "To find the exact area under the velocity curve between $t = 2$ and $t = 5$, we need to integrate the velocity function with respect to time from $t = 2$ to $t = 5$.\n\nThe integral of the velocity function $v(t) = t^2 - 6t + 8$ is:\n\n$$\\int_{2}^{5} (t^2 - 6t + 8) dt$$\n\nNow, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\n$$\\int (t^2 - 6t + 8) dt = \\frac{1}{3}t^3 - 3t^2 + 8t + C$$\n\nWe don't need to worry about the constant $C$ since we are finding a definite integral.\n\nNow, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds $t = 5$ and $t = 2$:\n\n$$\\left[\\frac{1}{3}(5)^3 - 3(5)^2 + 8(5)\\right] - \\left[\\frac{1}{3}(2)^3 - 3(2)^2 + 8(2)\\right]$$\n\n$$= \\left[\\frac{125}{3} - 75 + 40\\right] - \\left[\\frac{8}{3} - 12 + 16\\right]$$\n\n$$= \\left[\\frac{117}{3}\\right] - \\left[\\frac{4}{3}\\right]$$\n\n$$= \\frac{113}{3}$$\n\nSo, the exact area under the velocity curve between $t = 2$ and $t = 5$ is $\\frac{113}{3}$."
