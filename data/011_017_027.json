    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 3x3 Latin square using the numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n\nWe can start by filling in the first row and first column, which can be done in (3-1)! ways, since the first element is fixed (without loss of generality, we can assume it's 1). So, there are 2! = 2 ways to fill in the first row and first column.\n\nNow, we have two remaining positions in the second row and two remaining positions in the second column. There are two possibilities for the second row and second column:\n\n1. They have the same number (e.g., both have 2 or both have 3).\n2. They have different numbers (e.g., one has 2 and the other has 3).\n\nIn the first case, there is only 1 way to fill in the rest of the Latin square, since the remaining number must go in the third row and third column.\n\nIn the second case, there are also only 1 way to fill in the rest of the Latin square, since the remaining numbers must go in the third row and third column.\n\nSo, there are 2 ways to fill in the first row and first column, and for each of those ways, there are 2 possibilities for the second row and second column, giving a total of 2 x 2 = 4 distinct 3x3 Latin squares using the numbers 1, 2, and 3."
