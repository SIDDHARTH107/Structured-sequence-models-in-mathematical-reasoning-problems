    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies these conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let's denote the integer we are looking for as x.\n\nWe have the following system of congruences:\n\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 4 (mod 9)\nx ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n\nFirst, we find the product of the moduli: N = 7 * 9 * 11 = 693.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\n\nN1 = N/7 = 693/7 = 99\nN2 = N/9 = 693/9 = 77\nN3 = N/11 = 693/11 = 63\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of these partial products:\n\ny1 ≡ N1^(-1) (mod 7) => 99^(-1) ≡ 1 (mod 7)\ny2 ≡ N2^(-1) (mod 9) => 77^(-1) ≡ 1 (mod 9)\ny3 ≡ N3^(-1) (mod 11) => 63^(-1) ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nBy trying out different values, we find:\n\ny1 = 1 (since 99 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 7))\ny2 = 4 (since 77 * 4 ≡ 1 (mod 9))\ny3 = 2 (since 63 * 2 ≡ 1 (mod 11))\n\nNow, we can compute the solution x:\n\nx = (3 * N1 * y1) + (4 * N2 * y2) + (5 * N3 * y3)\nx = (3 * 99 * 1) + (4 * 77 * 4) + (5 * 63 * 2)\nx = 297 + 1232 + 630\nx = 2159\n\nHowever, we need the smallest positive integer, so we should find the smallest positive x by taking x % N:\n\nx = 2159 % 693 = 466\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is 466."
