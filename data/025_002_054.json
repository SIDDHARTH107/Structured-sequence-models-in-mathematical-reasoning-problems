    "message_2": "To find the points of intersection between the curve $y = x^3 + 3x^2$ and the line $y = x + 3$, we need to solve the following equation for $x$:\n\n$$x^3 + 3x^2 = x + 3$$\n\nRearrange the equation to get a polynomial:\n\n$$x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 3 = 0$$\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this polynomial. We can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (3) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). So, the possible rational roots are $\\pm1, \\pm3$. \n\nBy trying these possible roots, we find that $x = -1$ is a root:\n\n$$(-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 - (-1) - 3 = -1 + 3 + 1 - 3 = 0$$\n\nSince $x = -1$ is a root, we can divide the polynomial by $(x + 1)$ to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n$$\\frac{x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 3}{x + 1} = x^2 + 2x + 3$$\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the quadratic $x^2 + 2x + 3$. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(3)}}{2(1)}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 12}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{-8}}{2}$$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has two complex roots. Therefore, the original polynomial has one real root and two complex roots.\n\nSo, the curve $y = x^3 + 3x^2$ intersects the line $y = x + 3$ in exactly three distinct points: one real point corresponding to the real root $x = -1$, and two complex points corresponding to the complex roots of the quadratic."
