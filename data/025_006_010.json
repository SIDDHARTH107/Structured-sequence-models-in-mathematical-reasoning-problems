    "message_2": "To compute the second cohomology group H^2(X, Z) of X with integer coefficients, we can use the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem. The Lefschetz fixed-point theorem states that if X is a smooth projective variety over the complex numbers and f: X â†’ X is a morphism, then the number of fixed points of f is equal to the alternating sum of the traces of the action of f* on the cohomology groups of X.\n\nIn our case, X is a smooth projective curve given by the equation f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 in the complex projective plane P^2. This curve is a smooth conic, which is isomorphic to the projective line P^1. The cohomology groups of P^1 are given by:\n\nH^0(P^1, Z) = Z\nH^1(P^1, Z) = 0\nH^2(P^1, Z) = Z\n\nSince X is isomorphic to P^1, the cohomology groups of X are the same as those of P^1. Therefore, the second cohomology group H^2(X, Z) of X with integer coefficients is Z."
