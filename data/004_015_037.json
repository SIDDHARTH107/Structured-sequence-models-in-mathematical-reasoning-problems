    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = 3x^3 - 9x^2 + 4x - 2, we need to find the points where the second derivative changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^3 - 9x^2 + 4x - 2) = 9x^2 - 18x + 4\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\nf''(x) = d/dx(9x^2 - 18x + 4) = 18x - 18\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to solve f''(x) = 0:\n18x - 18 = 0\n18x = 18\nx = 1\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 1. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, plug x = 1 into the original function f(x):\nf(1) = 3(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 4(1) - 2 = 3 - 9 + 4 - 2 = -4\n\nThus, the inflection point is at (1, -4)."
