    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext, we need to use the RSA encryption formula:\n\nciphertext = message^e mod n\n\nwhere message = 17, e = 13, and n = 77.\n\nciphertext = 17^13 mod 77\n\nFirst, let's calculate 17^13:\n\n17^13 = 9904578032905937\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when this number is divided by 77:\n\n9904578032905937 mod 77 = 63\n\nSo, the ciphertext that Alice will send to Bob is 63."
