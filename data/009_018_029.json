    "message_2": "First, we find the complementary solution by solving the homogeneous equation:\n\ny'' + 2y' - 3y = 0\n\nWe use the auxiliary equation method:\n\nm^2 + 2m - 3 = 0\n\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as:\n\n(m + 3)(m - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the solutions are m1 = -3 and m2 = 1. Therefore, the complementary solution is:\n\nyc(t) = C1 * e^(-3t) + C2 * e^t\n\nNow, we find the particular solution using the method of undetermined coefficients. Since the right-hand side of the given differential equation is 6sin(2t), we assume a particular solution of the form:\n\nyp(t) = A * cos(2t) + B * sin(2t)\n\nNow, we find the first and second derivatives of yp(t):\n\nyp'(t) = -2A * sin(2t) + 2B * cos(2t)\nyp''(t) = -4A * cos(2t) - 4B * sin(2t)\n\nSubstitute yp(t), yp'(t), and yp''(t) into the given differential equation:\n\n(-4A * cos(2t) - 4B * sin(2t)) + 2(-2A * sin(2t) + 2B * cos(2t)) - 3(A * cos(2t) + B * sin(2t)) = 6sin(2t)\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients of cos(2t) and sin(2t):\n\n-4A + 4B - 3A = 0  => A = 2B\n-4B - 4A - 3B = 6  => -7B = 6\n\nSolving for A and B, we get:\n\nB = -6/7\nA = -12/7\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\nyp(t) = (-12/7) * cos(2t) - (6/7) * sin(2t)\n\nFinally, the general solution of the given differential equation is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions:\n\ny(t) = C1 * e^(-3t) + C2 * e^t - (12/7) * cos(2t) - (6/7) * sin(2t)"
