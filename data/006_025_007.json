    "message_2": "If the dancer has 10 different dance moves and performs each move for an equal amount of time, then each move will be performed for 1/10 of the total time.\n\nSince the performance is 5 minutes long, each move will be performed for (1/10) * 5 = 1/2 minute.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of the dancer performing a specific type of dance move during the 5-minute performance. Since each move is performed for an equal amount of time, the probability of performing any specific move at any given time is 1/10.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the dancer performing a specific type of dance move during the 5-minute performance is 1/10 or 10%."
