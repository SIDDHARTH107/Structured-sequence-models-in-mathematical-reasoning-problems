    "message_2": "M is a 2-dimensional sphere with radius 1 centered at the origin. The isometries of M are the rotations and reflections that preserve the distance between points on the sphere. Since we are looking for isometries that fix the point (1, 0, 0) and have determinant 1, we can focus on rotations around the x-axis.\n\nLet R(θ) be a rotation matrix around the x-axis by an angle θ:\n\nR(θ) = | 1    0         0    |\n       | 0  cos(θ) -sin(θ) |\n       | 0  sin(θ)  cos(θ) |\n\nWe want to find the rotations R(θ) that fix the point (1, 0, 0). This means that R(θ)(1, 0, 0) = (1, 0, 0). Applying the rotation matrix to the point (1, 0, 0), we get:\n\nR(θ)(1, 0, 0) = | 1    0         0    | | 1 |\n               | 0  cos(θ) -sin(θ) | | 0 |\n               | 0  sin(θ)  cos(θ) | | 0 |\n\nMultiplying the matrix by the point, we obtain:\n\nR(θ)(1, 0, 0) = | 1 |\n               | 0 |\n               | 0 |\n\nSince R(θ)(1, 0, 0) = (1, 0, 0) for any θ, all rotations around the x-axis fix the point (1, 0, 0).\n\nNow, we need to find the rotations with determinant 1. The determinant of R(θ) is:\n\ndet(R(θ)) = 1 * (cos(θ) * cos(θ) - (-sin(θ)) * sin(θ)) = cos^2(θ) + sin^2(θ)\n\nSince cos^2(θ) + sin^2(θ) = 1 for all θ, all rotations around the x-axis have determinant 1.\n\nTherefore, the isometries of M that fix the point (1, 0, 0) and have determinant 1 are all rotations around the x-axis, represented by the rotation matrix R(θ) for any angle θ."
