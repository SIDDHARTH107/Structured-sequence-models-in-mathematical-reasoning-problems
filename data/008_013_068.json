    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to find the L and U matrices. The given system can be represented as the matrix equation Ax = b, where:\n\nA = |  3   2  -1 |\n    |  2  -2   4 |\n    | -1  1/2 -1 |\n\nb = |  6 |\n    | -3 |\n    |  0 |\n\nNow, we perform LU decomposition on matrix A. We want to find matrices L and U such that A = LU, where L is a lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix.\n\nStep 1: Initialize L and U matrices\n\nL = | 1  0  0 |\n    | 0  1  0 |\n    | 0  0  1 |\n\nU = | 3   2  -1 |\n    | 0   0   0 |\n    | 0   0   0 |\n\nStep 2: Perform Gaussian elimination to find U\n\nFirst row remains the same:\nU = | 3   2  -1 |\n    | 0   0   0 |\n    | 0   0   0 |\n\nSubtract (2/3) times the first row from the second row:\nU = |  3    2   -1  |\n    |  0  -4/3  4/3 |\n    |  0    0    0  |\n\nAdd the first row to the third row:\nU = |  3    2   -1  |\n    |  0  -4/3  4/3 |\n    |  0  5/2  -2  |\n\nStep 3: Fill in the L matrix with the multipliers used during Gaussian elimination\n\nL = |  1    0    0  |\n    | 2/3   1    0  |\n    | -1/3  3/5   1 |\n\nNow we have the L and U matrices. Next, we solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\nL = |  1    0    0  |       y = | y1 |       b = |  6  |\n    | 2/3   1    0  |           | y2 |           | -3  |\n    | -1/3  3/5   1 |           | y3 |           |  0  |\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny1 = 6\ny2 = -3 - (2/3) * 6 = -7\ny3 = 0 - (-1/3) * 6 - (3/5) * (-7) = 2\n\nSo, y = |  6  |\n        | -7  |\n        |  2  |\n\nFinally, we solve the system Ux = y for x:\n\nU = |  3    2   -1  |       x = | x1 |       y = |  6  |\n    |  0  -4/3  4/3 |           | x2 |           | -7  |\n    |  0   5/2  -2  |           | x3 |           |  2  |\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx3 = (2 + 5) / 2 = 3.5\nx2 = (-7 - 4/3 * 3.5) * (-3/4) = 1.5\nx1 = (6 - 2 * 1.5 + 3.5) / 3 = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1\ny = 1.5\nz = 3.5"
