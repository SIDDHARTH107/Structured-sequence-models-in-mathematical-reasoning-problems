    "message_2": "To solve the equation 4^x ≡ 7 (mod 11) using the discrete logarithm problem, we need to find the value of x such that:\n\n4^x ≡ 7 (mod 11)\n\nFirst, let's find the powers of 4 modulo 11:\n\n4^1 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n4^2 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n4^3 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n4^4 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n4^5 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we can see that 4^5 ≡ 1 (mod 11), which means that the powers of 4 will start repeating after this point. This is because 4 has a multiplicative order of 5 modulo 11. So, we only need to check the powers of 4 up to 4^5.\n\nComparing the powers of 4 modulo 11 with 7, we can see that:\n\n4^3 ≡ 9 ≡ 7 (mod 11)\n\nSo, the solution to the equation 4^x ≡ 7 (mod 11) is x = 3."
