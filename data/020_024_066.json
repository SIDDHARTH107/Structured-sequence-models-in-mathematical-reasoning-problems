    "message_1": "A wholesaler is selling a product for $20 per unit. The cost of production for this product is $12 per unit. The demand function for this product is given by Q = 100 – P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price per unit. What should be the optimal price at which the wholesaler should sell the product to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to maximize profit, we need to first find the profit function. Profit is calculated as the difference between total revenue and total cost.\n\nTotal revenue (TR) is the product of the price per unit (P) and the quantity demanded (Q). In this case, TR = P * Q.\n\nTotal cost (TC) is the product of the cost of production per unit ($12) and the quantity demanded (Q). In this case, TC = 12 * Q.\n\nProfit (π) is the difference between total revenue and total cost: π = TR - TC.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given demand function (Q = 100 - P) into the profit function:\n\nπ = P * (100 - P) - 12 * (100 - P)\n\nNext, we will expand and simplify the profit function:\n\nπ = 100P - P^2 - 1200 + 12P\n\nπ = -P^2 + 112P - 1200\n\nTo find the optimal price to maximize profit, we need to find the vertex of this quadratic function. The x-coordinate of the vertex (P) can be found using the formula P = -b / 2a, where a = -1 and b = 112:\n\nP = -112 / (2 * -1)\n\nP = 56\n\nSo, the optimal price at which the wholesaler should sell the product to maximize their profit is $56 per unit."
