Each project requires a different number of workers: Project A needs 3 workers, Project B needs 2 workers, Project C needs 4 workers, and Project D needs 1 worker. How many possible ways can the company allocate the workers to the projects?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula, which is used to find the number of ways to divide a set of items into distinct groups. The formula is:\n\nMultinomial Coefficient = n! / (n1! * n2! * n3! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, workers), and n1, n2, n3, ..., nk are the number of items in each group (in this case, the number of workers required for each project).\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\nn = 10 (total number of workers)\nn1 = 3 (workers needed for Project A)\nn2 = 2 (workers needed for Project B)\nn3 = 4 (workers needed for Project C)\nn4 = 1 (workers needed for Project D)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the multinomial coefficient formula:\n\nMultinomial Coefficient = 10! / (3! * 2! * 4! * 1!)\n\nFirst, let's find the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n2! = 2 × 1 = 2\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n1! = 1\n\nNow, we can plug these factorials back into the formula:\n\nMultinomial Coefficient = 3,628,800 / (6 * 2 * 24 * 1)\nMultinomial Coefficient = 3,628,800 / 288\n\nFinally, we can calculate the result:\n\nMultinomial Coefficient = 12,600\n\nSo, there are 12,600 possible ways for the company to allocate the 10 workers to the 4 projects."
