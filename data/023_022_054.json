    "message_2": "To find the integral ∫ |sin(πt)| |f(t)| dt for t in [-1,1], we can first find the Fourier series representation of the function f(t) = 2t^2 + 3t + 1 over the interval [-1, 1].\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a function f(t) over the interval [-L, L] is given by:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ [an * cos(nπt/L) + bn * sin(nπt/L)]\n\nwhere a0, an, and bn are the Fourier coefficients, given by:\n\na0 = (1/L) ∫ f(t) dt over [-L, L]\nan = (1/L) ∫ f(t) * cos(nπt/L) dt over [-L, L]\nbn = (1/L) ∫ f(t) * sin(nπt/L) dt over [-L, L]\n\nIn our case, L = 1, so we have:\n\na0 = ∫ f(t) dt over [-1, 1]\nan = ∫ f(t) * cos(nπt) dt over [-1, 1]\nbn = ∫ f(t) * sin(nπt) dt over [-1, 1]\n\nNow, let's compute the Fourier coefficients:\n\na0 = ∫ (2t^2 + 3t + 1) dt over [-1, 1]\na0 = [2/3 * t^3 + 3/2 * t^2 + t] evaluated from -1 to 1\na0 = (2/3 + 3/2 + 1) - (-2/3 + 3/2 - 1) = 2\n\nan = ∫ (2t^2 + 3t + 1) * cos(nπt) dt over [-1, 1]\nSince the function f(t) is even, all the bn coefficients will be zero. So, we only need to compute the an coefficients.\n\nTo compute an, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = 2t^2 + 3t + 1, dv = cos(nπt) dt\nThen, du = (4t + 3) dt, v = (1/nπ) * sin(nπt)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nan = (1/nπ) * (2t^2 + 3t + 1) * sin(nπt) evaluated from -1 to 1 - (1/nπ) * ∫ (4t + 3) * sin(nπt) dt over [-1, 1]\n\nThe first term will be zero since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n.\n\nNow, we need to compute the second term:\n\nLet u = 4t + 3, dv = sin(nπt) dt\nThen, du = 4 dt, v = (-1/n^2π^2) * cos(nπt)\n\nUsing integration by parts again:\n\nan = (4/n^2π^2) * (4t + 3) * cos(nπt) evaluated from -1 to 1 - (4/n^2π^2) * ∫ cos(nπt) dt over [-1, 1]\n\nThe second term will be zero since the integral of cos(nπt) over [-1, 1] is zero.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nan = (4/n^2π^2) * [(4 + 3) - (-4 + 3)] = (56/n^2π^2)\n\nNow, we have the Fourier series representation of f(t):\n\nf(t) = 2 + Σ (56/n^2π^2) * cos(nπt)\n\nNow, we need to compute the integral ∫ |sin(πt)| |f(t)| dt for t in [-1,1]:\n\n∫ |sin(πt)| |f(t)| dt = ∫ |sin(πt)| (2 + Σ (56/n^2π^2) * cos(nπt)) dt\n\nThis integral is difficult to compute directly. However, we can approximate the integral by considering a finite number of terms in the Fourier series representation of f(t) and using numerical integration methods such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule to compute the integral. The more terms we include in the Fourier series representation, the better the approximation will be."
