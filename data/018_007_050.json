    "message_2": "Let X be a set with 3 distinct elements, i.e., X = {a, b, c}. The power set of X, denoted as P(X), is the set of all possible subsets of X, including the empty set and X itself.\n\nP(X) = {âˆ…, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}\n\nThe size of set X is 3, as it has 3 distinct elements. The size of the power set P(X) is 8, as it has 8 distinct subsets.\n\nNow, let's prove that the power set of set X is always larger than the set X itself using this specific example.\n\nThe size of set X is 3, and the size of the power set P(X) is 8. Since 8 > 3, the power set P(X) is larger than the set X.\n\nIn general, for a set with n distinct elements, the size of its power set is 2^n. In this case, n = 3, so the size of the power set is 2^3 = 8. Since 2^n > n for all positive integers n, the power set of a set is always larger than the set itself."
