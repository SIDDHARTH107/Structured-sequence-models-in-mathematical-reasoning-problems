    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we can use the Sylow theorems and some group theory concepts.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of 72: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nNow, we will use the Sylow theorems to find the possible number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the prime factor 2 (p = 2):\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups have order 2^3 = 8.\n2. Let n_2 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. By Sylow's third theorem, n_2 must divide 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9.\n\nFor the prime factor 3 (p = 3):\n\n1. Sylow 3-subgroups have order 3^2 = 9.\n2. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. By Sylow's third theorem, n_3 must divide 2^3 = 8, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, we will analyze the possible combinations of n_2 and n_3 values:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: There is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, the group is the direct product of these subgroups, and the group is abelian (Z_8 x Z_9). We are looking for non-abelian groups, so this case is not relevant.\n\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: There is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, the group is the semi-direct product of these subgroups. There are two possible semi-direct products, one of which is abelian, and the other is non-abelian. So, there is one non-abelian group in this case.\n\n3. If n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1: There are nine Sylow 2-subgroups and one Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, the group is the semi-direct product of these subgroups. There are three possible semi-direct products, all of which are non-abelian. So, there are three non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n4. If n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4: There are nine Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, the group is the semi-direct product of these subgroups. There are six possible semi-direct products, all of which are non-abelian. So, there are six non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 3 + 6 = 10 non-abelian groups of order 72."
