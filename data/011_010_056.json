    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's create a 5x5 grid (since we have points from (0,0) to (4,4)) and fill it with the number of paths to reach each point while staying below the line y=x.\n\nFirst, initialize the grid with 0s and set the value at (0,0) to 1, since there's only one way to start at (0,0).\n\n```\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nNow, we can fill in the grid row by row, starting from the top-left corner. For each cell (i, j), the number of paths to reach it is the sum of the paths to reach the cell above it (i-1, j) and the cell to the left of it (i, j-1), as long as the cell is below the line y=x. If the cell is on the line y=x, we only consider the paths to reach the cell above it (i-1, j).\n\nAfter filling in the grid, we get:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 3 5 7 9\n1 4 7 10 13\n1 5 9 13 0\n```\n\nThe number of paths to reach point (4,4) while staying below the line y=x is 13."
