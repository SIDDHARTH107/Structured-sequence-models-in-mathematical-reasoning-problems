    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of sheets in the covering map f as n. Since Y is connected, we can use the fact that the number of sheets is equal to the index of the image of the induced homomorphism on the fundamental groups.\n\nLet's denote the base points in X and Y as x_0 and y_0, respectively, with f(y_0) = x_0. The induced homomorphism on the fundamental groups is given by $f_*: \\pi_1(Y, y_0) \\to \\pi_1(X, x_0)$. \n\nSince $\\pi_1(X, x_0) = \\mathbb{Z}_3$, the possible orders of subgroups of $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ are 1 and 3, as these are the divisors of 3. If the index of the image of $f_*$ is 1, then the image is the whole group, and the covering would be trivial. However, since Y is connected, the covering is nontrivial, so the index must be 3.\n\nTherefore, the covering map f has 3 sheets."
