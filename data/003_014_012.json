    "message_1": "A math student is asked to graph the sine function y = 2 sin x for values of x between 0 and 2π. What is the maximum and minimum value of y for this function? At what values of x do these maximum and minimum values occur?",
    "message_2": "The maximum and minimum values of the sine function y = 2 sin x can be found by analyzing the amplitude of the function. The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function, which in this case is 2. Therefore, the maximum value of y is 2 and the minimum value of y is -2.\n\nThe maximum value of y = 2 sin x occurs when sin x = 1, and the minimum value occurs when sin x = -1. To find the values of x for which these maximum and minimum values occur, we can look at the unit circle.\n\nFor sin x = 1, this occurs at x = π/2 (90 degrees).\nFor sin x = -1, this occurs at x = 3π/2 (270 degrees).\n\nSo, the maximum value of y is 2, which occurs at x = π/2, and the minimum value of y is -2, which occurs at x = 3π/2."
