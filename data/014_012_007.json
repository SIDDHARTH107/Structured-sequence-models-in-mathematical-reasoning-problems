    "message_1": "If a message is encrypted using Vigenere cipher with the keyword \"MATH\", and the plaintext is \"CALCULUS\", what is the ciphertext?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"CALCULUS\" using the Vigenere cipher with the keyword \"MATH\", we first need to repeat the keyword to match the length of the plaintext. In this case, the keyword becomes \"MATHMATH\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere square to find the corresponding ciphertext letters. The Vigenere square is a 26x26 grid of letters, where each row and column represent the 26 letters of the alphabet. To find the ciphertext letter, we locate the intersection of the plaintext letter's row and the keyword letter's column.\n\nHere's the encryption process for each letter:\n\n1. C (plaintext) and M (keyword): The intersection is X.\n2. A (plaintext) and A (keyword): The intersection is A.\n3. L (plaintext) and T (keyword): The intersection is Z.\n4. C (plaintext) and H (keyword): The intersection is O.\n5. U (plaintext) and M (keyword): The intersection is E.\n6. L (plaintext) and A (keyword): The intersection is L.\n7. U (plaintext) and T (keyword): The intersection is F.\n8. S (plaintext) and H (keyword): The intersection is Z.\n\nSo, the ciphertext for the plaintext \"CALCULUS\" with the keyword \"MATH\" is \"XAZOELFZ\"."
