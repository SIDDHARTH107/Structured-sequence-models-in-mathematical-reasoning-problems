    "message_1": "Suppose there are two prime numbers, 13 and 17. We want to create a digital signature using these primes. Assuming that the message to be signed is the integer 5, what would be the value of the digital signature using the RSA algorithm? (Assume the public key is (85, 187) and the private key is (29, 187).)",
    "message_2": "To create a digital signature using the RSA algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the modulus n by multiplying the two prime numbers: n = 13 * 17 = 221.\n2. Calculate the totient of n: φ(n) = (13 - 1) * (17 - 1) = 12 * 16 = 192.\n3. Choose a public exponent e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1. In this case, e = 85.\n4. Calculate the private exponent d such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n)). In this case, d = 29.\n5. The public key is (e, n) = (85, 221) and the private key is (d, n) = (29, 221).\n\nNow, to sign the message (integer 5) using the private key, we need to compute the signature S using the following formula:\n\nS ≡ M^d (mod n)\n\nwhere M is the message (5) and d is the private exponent (29).\n\nS ≡ 5^29 (mod 221)\nS ≡ 133 (mod 221)\n\nSo, the digital signature for the message 5 using the RSA algorithm with the given public and private keys is 133."
