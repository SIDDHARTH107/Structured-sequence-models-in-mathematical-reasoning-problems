    "message_2": "An isometry is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points in the space. In this case, we are looking for isometries of the Euclidean metric $g = dx^2 + dy^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that fix the origin.\n\nLet $T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ be an isometry that fixes the origin. Then, for any points $p, q \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we have:\n\n$g(T(p), T(q)) = g(p, q)$.\n\nSince $T$ fixes the origin, we have $T(0, 0) = (0, 0)$. Now, let $p = (x, y)$ be an arbitrary point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We can write the isometry $T$ as a matrix transformation:\n\n$T(p) = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ax + by \\\\ cx + dy \\end{pmatrix}$,\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the conditions on $a, b, c, d$ such that $T$ is an isometry. Using the metric $g$, we have:\n\n$g(T(p), T(q)) = (ax + by)^2 + (cx + dy)^2$,\n\nand\n\n$g(p, q) = x^2 + y^2$.\n\nFor $T$ to be an isometry, we must have:\n\n$(ax + by)^2 + (cx + dy)^2 = x^2 + y^2$.\n\nExpanding this equation, we get:\n\n$a^2x^2 + 2abxy + b^2y^2 + c^2x^2 + 2cdxy + d^2y^2 = x^2 + y^2$.\n\nComparing the coefficients of the powers of $x$ and $y$, we obtain the following system of equations:\n\n1. $a^2 + c^2 = 1$\n2. $b^2 + d^2 = 1$\n3. $2ab + 2cd = 0$\n\nFrom equation (3), we have $ab + cd = 0$. Now, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n$ad - bc = \\pm 1$.\n\nThe isometries that fix the origin are rotations and reflections. For rotations, we have $ad - bc = 1$, and for reflections, we have $ad - bc = -1$. Thus, the isometries of the metric $g$ that fix the origin can be represented by matrices of the form:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$,\n\nwhere $a^2 + c^2 = b^2 + d^2 = 1$, $ab + cd = 0$, and $ad - bc = \\pm 1$."
