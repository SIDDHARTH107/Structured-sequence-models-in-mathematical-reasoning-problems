    "message_1": "A math student wants to find a number that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 4 when divided by 7. Using Chinese remainder theorem, what is the smallest possible positive integer that satisfies these conditions?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Chinese remainder theorem, we first need to find the product of the moduli, which in this case are 5, 3, and 7. The product is N = 5 * 3 * 7 = 105.\n\nNext, we need to find the partial products, which are obtained by dividing N by each of the moduli:\nN1 = N/5 = 105/5 = 21\nN2 = N/3 = 105/3 = 35\nN3 = N/7 = 105/7 = 15\n\nNow, we need to find the modular inverses of the partial products. These are the numbers that, when multiplied by the partial products, give a remainder of 1 when divided by the respective moduli. We can denote these as M1, M2, and M3.\n\nM1 ≡ N1^(-1) mod 5\n21 * M1 ≡ 1 mod 5\nM1 ≡ 1 mod 5 (since 21 * 1 = 21 ≡ 1 mod 5)\n\nM2 ≡ N2^(-1) mod 3\n35 * M2 ≡ 1 mod 3\nM2 ≡ 2 mod 3 (since 35 * 2 = 70 ≡ 1 mod 3)\n\nM3 ≡ N3^(-1) mod 7\n15 * M3 ≡ 1 mod 7\nM3 ≡ 1 mod 7 (since 15 * 1 = 15 ≡ 1 mod 7)\n\nNow, we can find the solution using the formula:\nx ≡ (a1 * N1 * M1) + (a2 * N2 * M2) + (a3 * N3 * M3) mod N\n\nIn this problem, a1 = 3, a2 = 2, and a3 = 4. Plugging in the values, we get:\nx ≡ (3 * 21 * 1) + (2 * 35 * 2) + (4 * 15 * 1) mod 105\nx ≡ 63 + 140 + 60 mod 105\nx ≡ 263 mod 105\n\nThe smallest positive integer that satisfies the conditions is x = 263 % 105 = 53."
