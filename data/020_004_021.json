    "message_2": "To minimize the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 6x + 5 subject to the constraint g(x) = 3x - 2 ≥ 0 using the quadratic programming method, we first need to find the critical points of the function and then check if they satisfy the constraint.\n\nThe critical points can be found by taking the first derivative of the function f(x) and setting it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 4x - 6\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n4x - 6 = 0\n4x = 6\nx = 3/2\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point satisfies the constraint g(x) = 3x - 2 ≥ 0:\n\ng(3/2) = 3(3/2) - 2 = 9/2 - 2 = 5/2\n\nSince 5/2 > 0, the constraint is satisfied. Therefore, the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 6x + 5 subject to the constraint g(x) = 3x - 2 ≥ 0 occurs at x = 3/2.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging x = 3/2 back into the function f(x):\n\nf(3/2) = 2(3/2)^2 - 6(3/2) + 5 = 2(9/4) - 9 + 5 = 9/2 - 9 + 5 = 1/2\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 6x + 5 subject to the constraint g(x) = 3x - 2 ≥ 0 is f(3/2) = 1/2."
