    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Tetrix, is a fractal constructed by repeatedly removing tetrahedra from a larger tetrahedron. To find the total number of triangles in the Sierpinski pyramid up to the 5th level, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal triangles = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nwhere n is the number of levels.\n\nFor the 5th level:\n\nTotal triangles = (4^5 - 1) / 3\nTotal triangles = (1024 - 1) / 3\nTotal triangles = 1023 / 3\nTotal triangles = 341\n\nSo, there are 341 triangles in the Sierpinski pyramid when constructing it up to the 5th level."
