    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\n$x + 2y - 3z = 10$\n\n$2x + 4y - 6z = 20$\n\n$3x + 6y - 9z = 30$\n\nFind the solution(s) of the system of linear equations.",
    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are not independent, and the system is actually equivalent to a single equation:\n\n$x + 2y - 3z = 10$\n\nTo find the solutions, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. For example, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$ and $z$:\n\n$x = 10 - 2y + 3z$\n\nNow we have a parametric solution for the system, where $y$ and $z$ can be any real numbers, and $x$ is determined by the equation above. The solution set is:\n\n$(x, y, z) = (10 - 2y + 3z, y, z)$, where $y$ and $z$ are any real numbers."
