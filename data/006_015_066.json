    "message_1": "What is the probability of a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) cyber attack occurring on a network within a given day if the historical data shows an average of 2 DDoS attacks per week?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a DDoS attack occurring on a network within a given day, we first need to find the average number of attacks per day.\n\nGiven that there are 2 DDoS attacks per week, we can find the average number of attacks per day by dividing the number of attacks by the number of days in a week:\n\n2 attacks / 7 days = 2/7 ≈ 0.2857 attacks per day\n\nNow, we can use the Poisson distribution to find the probability of a DDoS attack occurring on a given day. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, DDoS attacks) occurring in a fixed interval of time (one day).\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of events (DDoS attacks), k is the number of events we want to find the probability for (in this case, at least 1 attack), λ is the average number of events per interval (0.2857 attacks per day), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nTo find the probability of at least 1 DDoS attack occurring on a given day, we can find the probability of no attacks occurring and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\n\nUsing the Poisson PMF formula with k = 0:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.2857) * 0.2857^0) / 0! = e^(-0.2857)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - e^(-0.2857) ≈ 1 - 0.7513 ≈ 0.2487\n\nSo, the probability of a DDoS attack occurring on a network within a given day is approximately 24.87%."
