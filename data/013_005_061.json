    "message_1": "In a game of chicken, Player 1 has two options: swerve (S) or continue straight (C). Player 2 also has two options: swerve (S) or continue straight (C). If both players swerve, both incur a cost of 0. If both players continue straight, both incur a cost of 10. If one player swerves and the other continues straight, the player who swerved incurs a cost of 15 and the player who continued straight incurs a cost of 0. Find the Nash equilibrium of the game.",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the payoffs for each player in each possible scenario. We can represent the payoffs in a matrix:\n\n```\n          Player 2\n          S    C\n        +----+----+\n   S  | 0,0 |15,0 |\nP      +----+----+\nl C  | 0,15|10,10|\na      +----+----+\ny\ne\nr\n1\n```\n\nNow, let's find the best responses for each player:\n\n1. If Player 1 swerves (S), Player 2's best response is to continue straight (C) since the payoff is 0 for swerving and 0 for continuing straight.\n2. If Player 1 continues straight (C), Player 2's best response is to swerve (S) since the payoff is 15 for swerving and 10 for continuing straight.\n3. If Player 2 swerves (S), Player 1's best response is to continue straight (C) since the payoff is 0 for swerving and 0 for continuing straight.\n4. If Player 2 continues straight (C), Player 1's best response is to swerve (S) since the payoff is 15 for swerving and 10 for continuing straight.\n\nThere are two Nash equilibria in this game: (S, C) and (C, S). In the first equilibrium, Player 1 swerves and Player 2 continues straight, while in the second equilibrium, Player 1 continues straight and Player 2 swerves. Both equilibria result in one player incurring a cost of 15 and the other player incurring a cost of 0."
