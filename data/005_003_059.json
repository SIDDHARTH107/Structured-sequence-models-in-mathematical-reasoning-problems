The company collected data for last 5 years and obtained the following results:\n\n| Year | Number of employees (x) | Yearly revenue (y) |\n|------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| 1    | 10                     | 30                  |\n| 2    | 15                     | 38                  |\n| 3    | 12                     | 32                  |\n| 4    | 18                     | 43                  |\n| 5    | 20                     | 50                  |\n\nFind the equation of the best-fit line using regression analysis, and use it to predict the revenue if the number of employees is 25.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the best-fit line using regression analysis, we will use the least squares method. First, we need to calculate the mean of x (number of employees) and y (yearly revenue).\n\nMean of x (number of employees):\n(10 + 15 + 12 + 18 + 20) / 5 = 75 / 5 = 15\n\nMean of y (yearly revenue):\n(30 + 38 + 32 + 43 + 50) / 5 = 193 / 5 = 38.6\n\nNow, we need to calculate the slope (b1) and the y-intercept (b0) of the best-fit line using the following formulas:\n\nb1 = Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] / Σ(xi - x_mean)^2\nb0 = y_mean - b1 * x_mean\n\nFirst, let's calculate the values for the numerator and denominator of the b1 formula:\n\nΣ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] = (10-15)(30-38.6) + (15-15)(38-38.6) + (12-15)(32-38.6) + (18-15)(43-38.6) + (20-15)(50-38.6)\n= (-5)(-8.6) + (0)(-0.6) + (-3)(-6.6) + (3)(4.4) + (5)(11.4)\n= 43 + 0 + 19.8 + 13.2 + 57\n= 133\n\nΣ(xi - x_mean)^2 = (10-15)^2 + (15-15)^2 + (12-15)^2 + (18-15)^2 + (20-15)^2\n= (-5)^2 + (0)^2 + (-3)^2 + (3)^2 + (5)^2\n= 25 + 0 + 9 + 9 + 25\n= 68\n\nNow, we can calculate b1 and b0:\n\nb1 = 133 / 68 ≈ 1.9559\nb0 = 38.6 - 1.9559 * 15 ≈ 9.7618\n\nSo, the equation of the best-fit line is:\n\ny = 1.9559x + 9.7618\n\nNow, we can use this equation to predict the revenue if the number of employees is 25:\n\ny = 1.9559 * 25 + 9.7618 ≈ 58.6393\n\nTherefore, the predicted yearly revenue for 25 employees is approximately $58.64 million."
