Let $f: B \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. For any $v \\in E$, define $f(v) = f(\\pi(v))$. Show that the set $S = \\{v \\in E : f(v) = 0 \\}$ is a vector subbundle of $\\pi: E \\rightarrow B$. \n\nFor $n=3$, find the cross section of the vector subbundle $S$ of the vector bundle $\\pi: E \\rightarrow B$ given $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1$, where $B$ is the 2-sphere $S^2$.",
    "message_2": "To show that $S$ is a vector subbundle of $\\pi: E \\rightarrow B$, we need to show that for each $b \\in B$, the fiber $S_b = \\{v \\in E_b : f(v) = 0\\}$ is a vector subspace of $E_b$. Let $v_1, v_2 \\in S_b$ and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We want to show that $\\alpha v_1 + \\beta v_2 \\in S_b$.\n\nSince $v_1, v_2 \\in S_b$, we have $f(v_1) = f(\\pi(v_1)) = 0$ and $f(v_2) = f(\\pi(v_2)) = 0$. Now, $\\pi(\\alpha v_1 + \\beta v_2) = \\pi(v_1) = \\pi(v_2) = b$ because $\\pi$ is linear on the fibers. Therefore, $f(\\alpha v_1 + \\beta v_2) = f(\\pi(\\alpha v_1 + \\beta v_2)) = f(b) = 0$. This implies that $\\alpha v_1 + \\beta v_2 \\in S_b$, and thus $S_b$ is a vector subspace of $E_b$. Therefore, $S$ is a vector subbundle of $\\pi: E \\rightarrow B$.\n\nNow, let's find the cross section of the vector subbundle $S$ of the vector bundle $\\pi: E \\rightarrow B$ given $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1$, where $B$ is the 2-sphere $S^2$. Since $B$ is the 2-sphere, we can parameterize it using spherical coordinates:\n\n$$x = \\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi$$\n$$y = \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi$$\n$$z = \\cos\\theta$$\n\nwhere $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$ and $0 \\leq \\phi \\leq 2\\pi$. Now, we want to find the cross section $s: B \\rightarrow S$ such that $\\pi(s(b)) = b$ for all $b \\in B$. Since $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0$ on $S^2$, we have:\n\n$$s(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$$\n\nThis cross section maps points on the 2-sphere $S^2$ to points in the vector subbundle $S$ with the property that $f(s(\\theta, \\phi)) = 0$."
