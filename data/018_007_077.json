    "message_2": "Let A be a set containing 3 distinct elements, i.e., A = {a, b, c}. The power set of A, denoted by P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and the set A itself.\n\nP(A) = {∅, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}\n\nThe size of the power set of A is the number of elements in P(A). In this case, there are 8 elements in P(A). The size of set A is 3, as it contains 3 distinct elements.\n\nNow, let's prove that the power set of A is always larger than the set A itself. For any set A with n distinct elements, the size of its power set P(A) is 2^n. This is because each element in A can either be included or excluded from a subset, resulting in 2 choices for each element. Therefore, there are 2^n possible subsets in P(A).\n\nSince the size of A is n, we need to show that 2^n > n for all n ≥ 0.\n\nFor n = 0, 2^0 = 1 > 0.\nFor n = 1, 2^1 = 2 > 1.\nFor n = 2, 2^2 = 4 > 2.\nFor n = 3, 2^3 = 8 > 3.\n\nLet's assume that 2^k > k for some k ≥ 0. Now, we need to show that 2^(k+1) > (k+1).\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k > 2 * k (since 2^k > k by our assumption)\n2 * k > k + k ≥ k + 1 (since k ≥ 0)\n\nThus, 2^(k+1) > (k+1).\n\nBy induction, we have shown that the power set of A is always larger than the set A itself for all n ≥ 0."
