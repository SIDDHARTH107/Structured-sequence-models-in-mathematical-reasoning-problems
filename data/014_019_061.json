    "message_1": "A ciphertext reads \"0R1YTEEOWRMSR_SHRY_PMTOATO_TEELVA\" which was encrypted using a transposition cipher. If the plaintext message was originally 28 characters long, what was the dimension of the matrix used for encryption?",
    "message_2": "To determine the dimensions of the matrix used for encryption, we need to find two factors of the plaintext length (28 characters) that could form a matrix. The factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. \n\nSince a transposition cipher involves rearranging the characters in the plaintext, it is reasonable to assume that the matrix dimensions are not 1x28 or 28x1, as these would not result in any meaningful rearrangement.\n\nThe remaining possible dimensions for the matrix are 2x14, 4x7, and 7x4. Without more information about the specific transposition cipher used, we cannot definitively determine which of these dimensions was used for encryption. However, these are the possible dimensions of the matrix used for the transposition cipher."
