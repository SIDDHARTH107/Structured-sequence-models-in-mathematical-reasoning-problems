    "message_1": "Consider a game where two players, A and B, are trying to split a $100 prize between themselves. Player A has a private information about the prize: it is either $60 or $40 with equal probability. Before the split, both players can communicate with each other. However, player A is known to be a liar: whatever he says about the prize is not necessarily true. Player B knows this fact. Assuming that player B is rational and wants to maximize his own payoffs, what should he do when player A says that the prize is $60?",
    "message_2": "When player A says the prize is $60, player B should consider the fact that player A is a liar and could be lying about the prize amount. Since the prize is either $60 or $40 with equal probability, player B should assume that there is a 50% chance that the prize is $60 and a 50% chance that the prize is $40.\n\nTo maximize his own payoffs, player B should propose a split that takes into account the equal probability of both prize amounts. One way to do this is to propose a split based on the expected value of the prize, which is the average of the two possible prize amounts:\n\nExpected value = (0.5 * $60) + (0.5 * $40) = $30 + $20 = $50\n\nPlayer B should propose a 50-50 split, where each player would receive $50. This way, player B is maximizing his expected payoff regardless of whether player A is lying or telling the truth about the prize amount."
