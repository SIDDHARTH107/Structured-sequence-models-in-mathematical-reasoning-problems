    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 5 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (5 cm)³\nV = (4/3) * π * 125 cm³\nV = (4 * 125 * π) / 3 cm³\nV ≈ 523.6 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 523.6 cubic centimeters."
