    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The daily production capacity is 200 units. The company earns a profit of $10 on each unit of Product A and $15 on each unit of Product B. The production cost per unit of Product A and Product B are $6 and $8 respectively. Formulate a Quadratic programming problem to determine the daily production quantities of Product A and B that maximize the total profit of the company.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced daily and y be the number of units of Product B produced daily. We are given the following information:\n\n1. The daily production capacity is 200 units: x + y ≤ 200\n2. The profit per unit of Product A is $10, and the production cost per unit is $6: Profit A = 10x - 6x = 4x\n3. The profit per unit of Product B is $15, and the production cost per unit is $8: Profit B = 15y - 8y = 7y\n\nOur objective is to maximize the total profit of the company, which is the sum of the profits from Product A and Product B:\n\nTotal Profit = Profit A + Profit B = 4x + 7y\n\nNow we can formulate the Quadratic programming problem:\n\nMaximize: P(x, y) = 4x + 7y\n\nSubject to:\nx + y ≤ 200\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThis is a linear programming problem rather than a quadratic programming problem since the objective function and constraints are linear. To solve this problem, you can use linear programming techniques such as the simplex method or graphical methods to find the optimal daily production quantities of Product A and B that maximize the total profit of the company."
