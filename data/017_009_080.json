    "message_2": "First, we note that there is a mistake in the problem statement. If G is a group of order 9, it cannot be isomorphic to D3, which is a group of order 6. Instead, we will show that G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nSince G has order 9, by the Sylow theorems, there must exist a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, which is a subgroup of order 3^2 = 9. Let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup of G. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2. n_3 divides the order of G, which is 9.\n\nThe only possibility for n_3 is 1, which means that there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, and it must be a normal subgroup of G. Thus, P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, since P has order 9, by the classification of finite abelian groups, P must be isomorphic to either C9 (cyclic group of order 9) or C3 × C3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3). If P is isomorphic to C9, then G is isomorphic to P, since P is a normal subgroup of G and G has no other elements.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to C3 × C3, then P has an element of order 3, say a, and another element of order 3, say b, such that a ≠ b and a ≠ b^(-1). Since P is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the product of a and b, which is an element of G. However, the order of the product ab must divide the order of G, which is 9. Since the orders of a and b are both 3, the order of ab cannot be 1, 3, or 9. This is a contradiction, so P cannot be isomorphic to C3 × C3.\n\nTherefore, G must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
