    "message_2": "To find the number of $\\mathbb{Q}$-rational points on the elliptic curve $E$, we can use the method of 2-descent. This method involves finding the rank of the curve and the torsion points.\n\nFirst, we find the discriminant of the curve, which is given by the formula:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)$\n\nFor our curve, $a = -7$ and $b = 10$, so the discriminant is:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4(-7)^3 + 27(10)^2) = -16(1372) = -21952$\n\nSince $\\Delta \\neq 0$, the curve is non-singular.\n\nNext, we find the torsion points on the curve. The torsion points are the points of finite order, and their number is finite. The possible torsion groups for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $1 \\leq n \\leq 10$ and $n = 12$, or $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $1 \\leq n \\leq 4$.\n\nFor this curve, we can find the torsion points by trial and error. We find that there are no non-trivial torsion points, so the torsion subgroup is trivial, i.e., isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/1\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow we need to find the rank of the curve. The rank is the number of independent points of infinite order. We can use the method of 2-descent to find the rank. This involves finding the 2-Selmer group, which is a finite abelian group that contains the Mordell-Weil group (the group of $\\mathbb{Q}$-rational points) as a subgroup.\n\nFor this curve, we find that the 2-Selmer group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Since the torsion subgroup is trivial, the Mordell-Weil group is a subgroup of the 2-Selmer group with the same rank. Thus, the rank of the curve is 2.\n\nFinally, we find the number of $\\mathbb{Q}$-rational points on the curve. Since the torsion subgroup is trivial and the rank is 2, the Mordell-Weil group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. This means that there are infinitely many $\\mathbb{Q}$-rational points on the curve $E$."
