In this case, the intersection of A and B is:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, we need to verify that this intersection is a subset of both A and B. A subset is a set whose elements are all members of another set.\n\nFor A ∩ B to be a subset of A, all elements in A ∩ B must be in A:\n\n2 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A, so A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nFor A ∩ B to be a subset of B, all elements in A ∩ B must be in B:\n\n2 ∈ B and 4 ∈ B, so A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have verified that the intersection of A and B, A ∩ B = {2, 4}, is a subset of both A and B."
