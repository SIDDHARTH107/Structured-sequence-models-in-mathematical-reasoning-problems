    "message_2": "To use the gradient descent method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x. The derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2 is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 3\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent update rule:\n\nx_new = x_old - α * f'(x_old)\n\nwhere α is the learning rate (0.1 in this case).\n\nWe will start with the initial guess x0 = -5 and iterate until the change in x (|x_new - x_old|) is less than the error tolerance (0.01).\n\nLet's perform the iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_old = -5\nx_new = -5 - 0.1 * (2 * (-5) + 3) = -5 - 0.1 * (-7) = -5 + 0.7 = -4.3\n\nIteration 2:\nx_old = -4.3\nx_new = -4.3 - 0.1 * (2 * (-4.3) + 3) = -4.3 - 0.1 * (-5.6) = -4.3 + 0.56 = -3.74\n\nIteration 3:\nx_old = -3.74\nx_new = -3.74 - 0.1 * (2 * (-3.74) + 3) = -3.74 - 0.1 * (-4.48) = -3.74 + 0.448 = -3.292\n\nIteration 4:\nx_old = -3.292\nx_new = -3.292 - 0.1 * (2 * (-3.292) + 3) = -3.292 - 0.1 * (-3.584) = -3.292 + 0.3584 = -2.9336\n\nIteration 5:\nx_old = -2.9336\nx_new = -2.9336 - 0.1 * (2 * (-2.9336) + 3) = -2.9336 - 0.1 * (-2.8672) = -2.9336 + 0.28672 = -2.64688\n\nWe can see that the change in x between iteration 4 and 5 is |x_new - x_old| = |-2.64688 - (-2.9336)| = 0.28672, which is greater than the error tolerance of 0.01. We need to continue iterating until the change in x is less than 0.01.\n\nAfter performing more iterations, we find that:\n\nIteration 15:\nx_old = -1.49953488896\nx_new = -1.49953488896 - 0.1 * (2 * (-1.49953488896) + 3) = -1.49953488896 - 0.1 * (-0.00093122208) = -1.49953488896 + 0.000093122208 = -1.499441766752\n\nThe change in x between iteration 14 and 15 is |x_new - x_old| = |-1.499441766752 - (-1.49953488896)| = 0.000093122208, which is less than the error tolerance of 0.01.\n\nSo, it takes 15 iterations for the gradient descent algorithm to find the minimum of the function within an error tolerance of 0.01."
