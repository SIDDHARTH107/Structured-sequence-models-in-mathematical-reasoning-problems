    "message_2": "To find the average value of a continuous function on a given interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function f(x) = sin(x) and the interval is [0, π]. So, a = 0 and b = π.\n\nAverage value = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[0, π] sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π.\n\n∫ sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we will evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n-(-cos(π)) + cos(0) = 2\n\nNow, we will plug this value back into the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * 2 = 2/π\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the average value of the function f(x) = sin(x) on the interval [0, π] is approximately 0.64."
