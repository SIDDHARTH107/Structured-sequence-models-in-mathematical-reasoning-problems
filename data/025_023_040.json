    "message_2": "To compute the intersection cohomology of the complex projective curve given by the equation $y^2z = x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$, we first need to determine the singularities of the curve and then compute the cohomology groups.\n\nLet's denote the curve by $C$ and the equation by $F(x, y, z) = y^2z - x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z) = 0$. To find the singularities, we compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -y^2 + 2xz - x\\lambda z - z^2 + \\lambda z^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2yz$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = y^2 - x^2 + 2x\\lambda z - \\lambda^2 z^2$\n\nA point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a singularity if and only if $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(x_0, y_0, z_0) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(x_0, y_0, z_0) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}(x_0, y_0, z_0) = 0$ and $F(x_0, y_0, z_0) = 0$. By analyzing these equations, we can see that the curve has three singular points: $(0, 0, 1)$, $(1, 0, 1)$, and $(\\lambda, 0, 1)$.\n\nNow, we compute the cohomology groups. Since $C$ is a complex projective curve, it is a one-dimensional complex manifold, and its intersection cohomology groups are given by:\n\n$IH^0(C) = H^0(C) = \\mathbb{C}$\n\n$IH^1(C) = H^1(C)$\n\n$IH^2(C) = H^2(C) = \\mathbb{C}$\n\nTo compute $H^1(C)$, we use the fact that for a smooth projective curve, the first Betti number $b_1$ is equal to $2g$, where $g$ is the genus of the curve. The genus can be computed using the formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In our case, $d = 3$, so the genus is:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3-1)(3-2)}{2} = 1$\n\nThus, $b_1 = 2g = 2$, and $H^1(C) = \\mathbb{C}^2$.\n\nFinally, the intersection cohomology groups of the curve are:\n\n$IH^0(C) = \\mathbb{C}$\n\n$IH^1(C) = \\mathbb{C}^2$\n\n$IH^2(C) = \\mathbb{C}$"
