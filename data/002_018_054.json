    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Side length of the cube = 6 cm\n\nNow, we can find the radius by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nRadius (r) = Diameter / 2 = 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume (V) = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nSubstitute the radius (r = 3 cm) into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (3 cm)^3\nV = (4/3) * π * 27 cm^3\nV = 36π cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is 36π cubic centimeters."
