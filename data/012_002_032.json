    "message_2": "The chromatic number of the given graph is 3.\n\nHere's one way to color the graph with three colors:\n\nColor 1: A, E\nColor 2: B, C\nColor 3: D, F\n\nNo adjacent vertices have the same color, and it is not possible to color the graph with only two colors since there are odd cycles (e.g., A-C-D-A). Therefore, the chromatic number is 3."
