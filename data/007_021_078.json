    "message_2": "To find the smallest factor of the composite number 4891 using Pollard's rho algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a random function f(x) that maps integers to integers. A common choice is f(x) = (x^2 + 1) % n, where n is the number we want to factor (in this case, 4891).\n\n2. Choose two initial values for x and y, usually x = y = 2.\n\n3. Iterate the function for both x and y, but apply the function twice for y at each step (this is the \"tortoise and hare\" method to avoid cycles).\n\n4. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and n. If the GCD is greater than 1 and less than n, we have found a non-trivial factor of n.\n\nLet's perform the algorithm:\n\n1. f(x) = (x^2 + 1) % 4891\n2. x = 2, y = 2\n\nIteration 1:\n- x = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) % 4891 = 5\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) % 4891 = 26\n- GCD(|5 - 26|, 4891) = GCD(21, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nIteration 2:\n- x = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) % 4891 = 26\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) % 4891 = 470\n- GCD(|26 - 470|, 4891) = GCD(444, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nIteration 3:\n- x = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) % 4891 = 677\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(470)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 1) % 4891 = 470\n- GCD(|677 - 470|, 4891) = GCD(207, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nIteration 4:\n- x = f(x) = (677^2 + 1) % 4891 = 470\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(470)) = f(470) = (470^2 + 1) % 4891 = 677\n- GCD(|470 - 677|, 4891) = GCD(207, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nIteration 5:\n- x = f(x) = (470^2 + 1) % 4891 = 677\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(677)) = f(470) = (470^2 + 1) % 4891 = 677\n- GCD(|677 - 677|, 4891) = GCD(0, 4891) = 4891 (continue, since it's equal to n)\n\nIteration 6:\n- x = f(x) = (677^2 + 1) % 4891 = 470\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(677)) = f(470) = (470^2 + 1) % 4891 = 677\n- GCD(|470 - 677|, 4891) = GCD(207, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nAt this point, the algorithm seems to be stuck in a cycle. To break the cycle, we can change the initial values of x and y or change the function f(x). Let's change the initial values to x = 3 and y = 3 and repeat the process.\n\nIteration 1:\n- x = f(x) = (3^2 + 1) % 4891 = 10\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(3)) = f(10) = (10^2 + 1) % 4891 = 101\n- GCD(|10 - 101|, 4891) = GCD(91, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nIteration 2:\n- x = f(x) = (10^2 + 1) % 4891 = 101\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(101)) = f(470) = (470^2 + 1) % 4891 = 677\n- GCD(|101 - 677|, 4891) = GCD(576, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nIteration 3:\n- x = f(x) = (101^2 + 1) % 4891 = 470\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(677)) = f(470) = (470^2 + 1) % 4891 = 677\n- GCD(|470 - 677|, 4891) = GCD(207, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nWe are back in the same cycle. Let's change the function to f(x) = (x^2 + 2) % 4891 and start with x = 2 and y = 2.\n\nIteration 1:\n- x = f(x) = (2^2 + 2) % 4891 = 6\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(6) = (6^2 + 2) % 4891 = 38\n- GCD(|6 - 38|, 4891) = GCD(32, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nIteration 2:\n- x = f(x) = (6^2 + 2) % 4891 = 38\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(38)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 2) % 4891 = 471\n- GCD(|38 - 471|, 4891) = GCD(433, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nIteration 3:\n- x = f(x) = (38^2 + 2) % 4891 = 677\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(471)) = f(470) = (470^2 + 2) % 4891 = 676\n- GCD(|677 - 676|, 4891) = GCD(1, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nIteration 4:\n- x = f(x) = (677^2 + 2) % 4891 = 470\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(676)) = f(677) = (677^2 + 2) % 4891 = 470\n- GCD(|470 - 470|, 4891) = GCD(0, 4891) = 4891 (continue, since it's equal to n)\n\nIteration 5:\n- x = f(x) = (470^2 + 2) % 4891 = 676\n- y = f(f(y)) = f(f(470)) = f(676) = (676^2 + 2) % 4891 = 677\n- GCD(|676 - 677|, 4891) = GCD(1, 4891) = 1 (continue)\n\nAt this point, it seems that Pollard's rho algorithm is not finding a factor for 4891. In this case, it's better to switch to a different factoring method, such as trial division.\n\nUsing trial division, we can find that the smallest factor of 4891 is 53 (since 4891 = 53 * 89)."
