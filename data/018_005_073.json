    "message_2": "To determine the intersection of A and its complement in U, we first need to find the complement of A in U. The complement of A in U, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A.\n\nA' = {5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of A and A', denoted as A ∩ A'. The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ A' = {}\n\nAs we can see, there are no common elements between A and A', so the intersection is the empty set, denoted as {} or ∅.\n\nThus, the intersection of A and its complement in U is equal to the empty set. This is consistent with set theory, as the intersection of a set and its complement should always be the empty set."
