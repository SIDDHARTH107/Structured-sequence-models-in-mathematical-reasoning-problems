    "message_1": "Consider the non-commutative algebraic variety defined by the polynomial ring $R = k\\langle x, y\\rangle/(yx - qxy -1)$, where $q \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is a parameter and $k$ is an algebraically closed field. Let $I \\triangleleft R$ be the left ideal generated by $x - a$ and $y - b$. Determine all complex numbers $q$ such that the variety $V(I)$ is non-empty.",
    "message_2": "To determine the complex numbers $q$ for which the variety $V(I)$ is non-empty, we need to find the values of $q$ for which there exists a point $(a, b) \\in V(I)$. Recall that $V(I)$ is the set of points $(a, b)$ such that the polynomials in the ideal $I$ vanish, i.e., $x - a = 0$ and $y - b = 0$.\n\nSince $R = k\\langle x, y\\rangle/(yx - qxy -1)$, we have the relation $yx - qxy = 1$. Substituting $x = a$ and $y = b$, we get:\n\n$ab - qab = 1$.\n\nNow, we want to solve this equation for $q$. If $ab \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $ab$ to get:\n\n$1 - q = \\frac{1}{ab}$.\n\nSolving for $q$, we obtain:\n\n$q = 1 - \\frac{1}{ab}$.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ can be any elements of the algebraically closed field $k$, there are no restrictions on the values of $ab$. Therefore, $q$ can be any complex number of the form $1 - \\frac{1}{ab}$, where $a, b \\in k$ and $ab \\neq 0$. In other words, the variety $V(I)$ is non-empty for all complex numbers $q$ except $q = 1$.\n\nIf $q = 1$, the relation becomes $yx - xy = 1$, which implies that $x(y - 1) = 1$. If $x = a$, then $(a - 1)b = 1$. If $a = 1$, then $b$ can be any element of $k$, and if $a \\neq 1$, then $b = \\frac{1}{a - 1}$. In either case, there exists a point $(a, b) \\in V(I)$.\n\nThus, the variety $V(I)$ is non-empty for all complex numbers $q$."
