    "message_2": "To find the period, amplitude, and vertical shift of the function f(x) = 3sin(4x - π) + 2, we need to identify the different components of the function.\n\nThe general form of a sine function is f(x) = A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where:\n\n- A is the amplitude\n- B determines the period\n- C is the horizontal shift\n- D is the vertical shift\n\nIn our given function, f(x) = 3sin(4x - π) + 2, we can see that:\n\n- A = 3, so the amplitude is 3.\n- B = 4, so the period is (2π) / B = (2π) / 4 = π/2.\n- C = π, but since it's in the form (4x - π), the horizontal shift is C/B = π/4 (to the right).\n- D = 2, so the vertical shift is 2 units up.\n\nSo, the period is π/2, the amplitude is 3, and the vertical shift is 2 units up."
