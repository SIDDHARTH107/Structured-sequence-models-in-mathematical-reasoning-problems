    "message_2": "To prove that every group of order 49 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7, we will use the Sylow Theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 49. Since 49 = 7^2, by the Sylow Theorems, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_7, must divide 49 and satisfy n_7 ≡ 1 (mod 7). The only possibilities for n_7 are 1 and 49. However, since there cannot be 49 subgroups of order 7 in G, we must have n_7 = 1.\n\nLet P be the unique 7-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is the only 7-Sylow subgroup, it is normal in G. Now, we consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then it is isomorphic to Z_49, the cyclic group of order 49. In this case, we are done.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nSince G is not cyclic, it cannot have an element of order 49. Let x and y be two non-identity elements in G. Since P is a normal subgroup of G, we can form the quotient group G/P. The order of G/P is |G|/|P| = 49/7 = 7. Since G/P is a group of prime order, it is cyclic. Let gP be a generator of G/P, where g ∈ G.\n\nNow, consider the element xy. Since x and y are non-identity elements in G, their orders must be 7. Therefore, x^7 = y^7 = e, where e is the identity element in G. We have (xy)^7 = x^7y^7 = ee = e, so the order of xy is at most 7. If the order of xy is 1, then xy = e, which implies x = y^(-1), a contradiction since x and y are distinct non-identity elements. Thus, the order of xy must be 7.\n\nNow, we claim that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7, i.e., G ≅ Z_7 × Z_7. Define a map φ: G → Z_7 × Z_7 by φ(x^i y^j) = (i, j) for all x^i y^j ∈ G. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is well-defined: Since G is generated by x and y, every element in G can be uniquely represented as x^i y^j for some i, j ∈ {0, 1, ..., 6}. Thus, φ is well-defined.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let x^a y^b, x^c y^d ∈ G. Then,\nφ((x^a y^b)(x^c y^d)) = φ(x^a y^b x^c y^d) = φ(x^a x^c y^b y^d) = φ(x^(a+c) y^(b+d)) = (a+c, b+d) = (a, b) + (c, d) = φ(x^a y^b) + φ(x^c y^d).\n\n3. φ is injective: Suppose φ(x^i y^j) = φ(x^a y^b) for some x^i y^j, x^a y^b ∈ G. Then, (i, j) = (a, b), which implies i = a and j = b. Thus, x^i y^j = x^a y^b, and φ is injective.\n\n4. φ is surjective: For any (i, j) ∈ Z_7 × Z_7, there exists an element x^i y^j ∈ G such that φ(x^i y^j) = (i, j). Thus, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined homomorphism that is both injective and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G ≅ Z_7 × Z_7.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 49 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7."
