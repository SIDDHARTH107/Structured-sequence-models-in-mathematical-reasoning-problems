    "message_1": "Let X and Y be two algebraic varieties defined over a field k. Assume that X is birational to Y, and the dimension of X is equal to 3. Suppose that X has 2 singular points of multiplicity 2 and 3, respectively. Find the maximum possible number of singular points of Y.",
    "message_2": "Let's first recall the definition of birational equivalence. Two algebraic varieties X and Y are called birationally equivalent if there exist rational functions f: X → Y and g: Y → X such that g(f(x)) = x and f(g(y)) = y for all x in X and y in Y. In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the points of X and Y, except possibly for a lower-dimensional subset.\n\nNow, let's consider the singular points of X and Y. Since X and Y are birationally equivalent, we can use the rational functions f and g to map the singular points of X to Y and vice versa. Let S_X be the set of singular points of X, and S_Y be the set of singular points of Y. Then, we have |S_X| = 2 (given in the problem statement) and |S_Y| is the number of singular points of Y that we want to find.\n\nLet x1 and x2 be the singular points of X with multiplicities 2 and 3, respectively. Since f and g are rational functions, they can be undefined at some points. However, since X and Y are birationally equivalent, f and g must be defined at all but finitely many points. In particular, f must be defined at x1 and x2, and g must be defined at their images y1 = f(x1) and y2 = f(x2) in Y.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse image of the singular points of Y under the rational function g. Since g is defined at y1 and y2, we have g(y1) = x1 and g(y2) = x2. Moreover, since g is a rational function, it can have at most a finite number of other singular points in its inverse image. Let's denote the set of these additional singular points by T.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the dimension of X is equal to 3. Since X is a 3-dimensional variety, it can have at most a finite number of singular points. In particular, the union of S_X and T must be finite. Since |S_X| = 2, it follows that |T| must also be finite.\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum possible number of singular points of Y. Since the singular points of Y are the images of the singular points of X and the additional singular points in T under the rational function f, we have |S_Y| = |S_X| + |T|. Since |S_X| = 2 and |T| is finite, the maximum possible number of singular points of Y is also finite. However, without more information about the varieties X and Y, we cannot determine an exact value for this maximum number."
