    "message_2": "To find the transfer function H(jω), we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of y''(t), y'(t), y(t), and x(t) are Y(jω)(-ω^2), Y(jω)(-jω), Y(jω), and X(jω), respectively. So, the equation in the frequency domain becomes:\n\n(-ω^2)Y(jω) - 5jωY(jω) + 6Y(jω) = X(jω)\n\nNow, we can solve for the transfer function H(jω) = Y(jω)/X(jω):\n\nH(jω) = Y(jω) / X(jω) = 1 / (-ω^2 - 5jω + 6)\n\nNext, we need to find the steady-state output y_ss(t) when the input signal is x(t) = cos(2πt). The Fourier transform of cos(2πt) is (1/2)[δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)], where δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function. Therefore, the output Y(jω) can be found by multiplying H(jω) by the Fourier transform of x(t):\n\nY(jω) = H(jω) * (1/2)[δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]\n\nNow, we can find y_ss(t) by taking the inverse Fourier transform of Y(jω):\n\ny_ss(t) = (1/2) * [H(j(2π)) * e^(j2πt) + H(j(-2π)) * e^(-j2πt)]\n\nWe already have the expression for H(jω), so we can plug in ω = ±2π:\n\nH(j(2π)) = 1 / (-(2π)^2 - 5j(2π) + 6)\nH(j(-2π)) = 1 / (-(2π)^2 + 5j(2π) + 6)\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the expression for y_ss(t):\n\ny_ss(t) = (1/2) * [H(j(2π)) * e^(j2πt) + H(j(-2π)) * e^(-j2πt)]\n\nThis is the steady-state output of the system when the input signal is x(t) = cos(2πt), assuming zero initial conditions."
