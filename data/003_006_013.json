    "message_1": "A triangle has two angles of 40 degrees and 70 degrees, and a side opposite one of the 40 degree angles is 5 units long. Find the lengths of the other two sides using the law of sines.",
    "message_2": "Let's label the triangle as follows: \n\n- Angle A = 40 degrees (opposite side a)\n- Angle B = 70 degrees (opposite side b)\n- Angle C = third angle (opposite side c)\n\nFirst, we need to find the measure of angle C. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:\n\nC = 180 - (A + B) = 180 - (40 + 70) = 180 - 110 = 70 degrees\n\nNow that we have all three angles, we can use the law of sines to find the lengths of the other two sides. The law of sines states that:\n\na/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)\n\nWe are given that side a is 5 units long, so we can set up the following equations:\n\n5/sin(40) = b/sin(70) = c/sin(70)\n\nTo find side b, we can set up the proportion:\n\n5/sin(40) = b/sin(70)\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply and solve for b:\n\nb * sin(40) = 5 * sin(70)\nb = (5 * sin(70))/sin(40)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nb ≈ 6.427\n\nNow, we can find side c using the proportion:\n\n5/sin(40) = c/sin(70)\n\nCross-multiplying and solving for c:\n\nc * sin(40) = 5 * sin(70)\nc = (5 * sin(70))/sin(40)\n\nSince the values of sin(70) and sin(40) are the same as in the previous calculation, we find that:\n\nc ≈ 6.427\n\nSo, the lengths of the other two sides are approximately 6.427 units each."
