Suppose that the intersection form on the Picard group Pic(X) is given by the matrix:\n\n```\n[ 2 -1 0 ]\n[-1 2 0 ]\n[ 0 0 0 ]\n```\n\nCalculate the number of effective divisors in the linear system |2L| on X.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the number of effective divisors in the linear system |2L| on X, we need to compute the self-intersection number of 2L, which is given by the intersection product (2L)^3.\n\nLet L = aH_1 + bH_2 + cH_3, where H_1, H_2, and H_3 are the generators of the Picard group Pic(X). Then 2L = 2aH_1 + 2bH_2 + 2cH_3.\n\nNow, we compute the intersection product (2L)^3 using the given intersection form matrix:\n\n(2L)^3 = (2aH_1 + 2bH_2 + 2cH_3)^3\n       = 8a^3H_1^3 + 8b^3H_2^3 + 8c^3H_3^3 + other mixed terms\n\nSince H_3^3 = 0 (from the intersection form matrix), we only need to consider the H_1 and H_2 terms:\n\n(2L)^3 = 8a^3H_1^3 + 8b^3H_2^3 + other mixed terms\n\nUsing the intersection form matrix, we have:\n\nH_1^3 = 2, H_2^3 = 2, H_1^2H_2 = -1, H_1H_2^2 = -1\n\nSo, the mixed terms are:\n\n3(2a^2b(-1) + 2ab^2(-1)) = -6a^2b - 6ab^2\n\nNow, we can compute (2L)^3:\n\n(2L)^3 = 8a^3(2) + 8b^3(2) - 6a^2b - 6ab^2\n       = 16a^3 + 16b^3 - 6a^2b - 6ab^2\n\nThe number of effective divisors in the linear system |2L| is given by the self-intersection number (2L)^3 plus 1 (since we need to account for the trivial divisor):\n\nN = (2L)^3 + 1 = 16a^3 + 16b^3 - 6a^2b - 6ab^2 + 1\n\nWithout more information about the coefficients a, b, and c, we cannot compute the exact number of effective divisors in the linear system |2L|. However, the expression above gives us a general formula for the number of effective divisors in terms of a and b."
