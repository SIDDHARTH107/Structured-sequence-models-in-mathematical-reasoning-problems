    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 1 for x between 0 and 3, we need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 1) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n6x^2 - 18x + 12 = 0\n\nDivide by 6:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, x = 1 and x = 2 are the critical points.\n\nNow, we need to check the value of the function at these critical points and the endpoints of the interval [0, 3]:\n\nf(0) = 2(0)^3 - 9(0)^2 + 12(0) + 1 = 1\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 12(1) + 1 = 6\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 12(2) + 1 = 1\nf(3) = 2(3)^3 - 9(3)^2 + 12(3) + 1 = 10\n\nThe maximum value of f(x) for x between 0 and 3 is 10, which occurs at x = 3."
