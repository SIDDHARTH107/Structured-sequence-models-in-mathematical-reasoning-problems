    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x + 5| = 11, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 5 is positive or zero, so the equation becomes:\n2x + 5 = 11\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n2x = 6\n\nDivide by 2:\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: 2x + 5 is negative, so the equation becomes:\n-(2x + 5) = 11\n\nDistribute the negative sign:\n-2x - 5 = 11\n\nAdd 5 to both sides:\n-2x = 16\n\nDivide by -2:\nx = -8\n\nSo, the two solutions for x are x = 3 and x = -8."
