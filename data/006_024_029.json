    "message_2": "To find the probability that all 4 flights arrived on time, we need to multiply the probability of each individual flight arriving on time.\n\nThe probability of one flight arriving on time is 83% or 0.83 as a decimal.\n\nSo, the probability of all 4 flights arriving on time is:\n\n0.83 * 0.83 * 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.47458321\n\nTherefore, the probability that all 4 flights arrived on time is approximately 47.46%."
