The company determines that the demand function for the product is given by:  Q = 400 - 4P where Q is the quantity of the product sold and P is the price in dollars. The company wants to know what price it should sell the product for in order to maximize its profit. Assuming no fixed costs or other expenses, what is the optimal price for the company to sell the product?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to maximize profit, we first need to find the revenue function. Revenue is the product of price (P) and quantity (Q). So, the revenue function R(P) can be found by multiplying the demand function by the price:\n\nR(P) = P * Q = P * (400 - 4P)\n\nNow, we need to find the profit function. Profit is the difference between revenue and cost. Since the cost to manufacture each product is $40, the cost function is C(Q) = 40Q. We can substitute the demand function for Q:\n\nC(P) = 40(400 - 4P)\n\nThe profit function is the difference between the revenue function and the cost function:\n\nΠ(P) = R(P) - C(P) = P(400 - 4P) - 40(400 - 4P)\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the first derivative with respect to P and setting it to zero:\n\nΠ'(P) = d(Π(P))/dP = 0\n\nΠ'(P) = (400 - 8P) - 160 = 0\n\nSolving for P:\n\n240 - 8P = 0\n8P = 240\nP = 30\n\nThe optimal price for the company to sell the product is $30 to maximize its profit."
