    "message_1": "Let's say there is a polynomial function of degree 4 given by \n\nf(z) = z^4 - 8z^3 + 21z^2 - 24z + 12.\n\nUsing the fundamental theorem of algebra and Liouville's theorem, prove whether f(z) has any roots in the complex plane or not.",
    "message_2": "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that every non-constant polynomial function has at least one complex root. Since f(z) is a polynomial function of degree 4, it must have 4 roots in the complex plane, which may be real or complex.\n\nLiouville's theorem is not directly applicable to this problem, as it is a theorem in complex analysis that states that every bounded entire function must be constant. In this context, an entire function is a function that is holomorphic (complex-differentiable) on the entire complex plane. Since f(z) is a polynomial, it is an entire function, but we are not concerned with whether it is bounded or not in this problem.\n\nSo, by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, f(z) has 4 roots in the complex plane."
