The following table shows the transportation costs per unit in dollars:\n\n| Warehouse / Retail Store | X | Y | Z |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A | $50 | $70 | $90 |\n| B | $70 | $80 | $60 |\n| C | $80 | $50 | $40 |\n\nAssuming the factory wants to minimize transportation costs, what is the minimum total cost of transporting all 3000 units of goods? Use the network flow problem approach to solve.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the network flow approach, we will first create a bipartite graph with the warehouses on one side and the retail stores on the other side. The edges between the nodes will represent the transportation costs per unit.\n\nNext, we will use the Hungarian Algorithm to find the minimum total cost of transporting all 3000 units of goods.\n\nStep 1: Subtract the smallest value in each row from all the values in that row.\n\n| Warehouse / Retail Store | X | Y | Z |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A | 0 | 20 | 40 |\n| B | 10 | 20 | 0 |\n| C | 30 | 0 | 0 |\n\nStep 2: Subtract the smallest value in each column from all the values in that column.\n\n| Warehouse / Retail Store | X | Y | Z |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A | 0 | 0 | 40 |\n| B | 0 | 20 | 0 |\n| C | 20 | 0 | 0 |\n\nStep 3: Cover all zeros with the minimum number of lines.\n\nWe can cover all zeros with 3 lines: one horizontal line through row A, one horizontal line through row B, and one vertical line through column Y.\n\nStep 4: Since the number of lines (3) equals the number of rows (3), we can proceed to find the optimal assignment.\n\nOptimal assignment:\n- Warehouse A to Retail Store Y: 3000 * $70 = $210,000\n- Warehouse B to Retail Store X: 0 * $70 = $0\n- Warehouse C to Retail Store Z: 0 * $40 = $0\n\nMinimum total cost: $210,000\n\nTherefore, the minimum total cost of transporting all 3000 units of goods is $210,000."
