    "message_2": "To determine whether the sequence (f(n))n∈N converges in the topological space Y, we need to find if there exists a limit point y in Y such that for any open neighborhood U of y, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, f(n) is in U.\n\nConsider the sequence (f(n))n∈N, where f(x) = 1 / (1 + |x|) and x is a natural number. We have:\n\nf(1) = 1 / (1 + |1|) = 1 / 2\nf(2) = 1 / (1 + |2|) = 1 / 3\nf(3) = 1 / (1 + |3|) = 1 / 4\n...\n\nIn general, f(n) = 1 / (1 + n) for all n ∈ N.\n\nNow, let's examine the limit of this sequence as n approaches infinity:\n\nlim (n→∞) 1 / (1 + n)\n\nAs n grows larger, the denominator (1 + n) also grows larger, making the fraction 1 / (1 + n) smaller and smaller. Therefore, the limit of this sequence as n approaches infinity is 0:\n\nlim (n→∞) 1 / (1 + n) = 0\n\nHowever, 0 is not in the set Y, which contains the open interval (0, 1). Since the limit of the sequence (f(n))n∈N is not in Y, we can conclude that the sequence does not converge in the topological space Y with the subspace topology inherited from the standard topology of R."
