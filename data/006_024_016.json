    "message_1": "A group of 8 friends are planning to go on a weekend road trip. The probability of any of them getting car sick during the trip is 0.2. What is the probability that exactly 2 of them will get car sick during the trip?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, getting car sick) out of n trials (the 8 friends)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting car sick) for each trial (0.2)\n- n is the number of trials (8 friends)\n- k is the number of successes we want to find the probability for (2 friends getting car sick)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(8, 2) * (0.2)^2 * (1-0.2)^(8-2)\n\nFirst, let's find C(8, 2):\n\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = (8*7*6!)/(2!6!) = (8*7)/(2*1) = 28\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 2) = 28 * (0.2)^2 * (0.8)^6 = 28 * 0.04 * 0.262144 = 1.12 * 0.262144 â‰ˆ 0.2936\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 of the 8 friends will get car sick during the trip is approximately 0.2936 or 29.36%."
