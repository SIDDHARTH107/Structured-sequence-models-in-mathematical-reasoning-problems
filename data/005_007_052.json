    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nSuppose a math student collected data on the hours of study for a statistics test and the corresponding test scores. They found that the correlation coefficient between hours of study and test score is 0.75. \n\nIf the student studied for 10 hours, what would you predict their test score to be?",
    "message_2": "To predict the test score, we need more information than just the correlation coefficient. We need the equation of the regression line, which is in the form y = mx + b, where y is the test score, x is the hours of study, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nIf you can provide the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) or any two data points, I can help you predict the test score for a student who studied for 10 hours."
