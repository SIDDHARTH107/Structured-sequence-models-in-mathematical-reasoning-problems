    "message_2": "To prove that there exists only one non-abelian group of order 30 up to isomorphism, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 30, and let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G.\n\nSince the order of G is 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, we have the following possibilities for the Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By the third Sylow theorem, n_2 divides 15 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, 5, or 15. However, if n_2 = 1, then G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, which would imply that G is a semi-direct product of its Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups, and thus G would be abelian. So, n_2 must be 3, 5, or 15.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: By the third Sylow theorem, n_3 divides 10 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 10. If n_3 = 1, then G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, and as before, G would be abelian. So, n_3 must be 10.\n\n3. Sylow 5-subgroups: By the third Sylow theorem, n_5 divides 6 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6. If n_5 = 1, then G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, and as before, G would be abelian. So, n_5 must be 6.\n\nNow, we know that G has 10 Sylow 3-subgroups and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups. Since each Sylow 3-subgroup has order 3 and each Sylow 5-subgroup has order 5, we have:\n\n|G| = 30 = 3 * 10 - 10 + 5 * 6 - 6 + 1\n\nHere, we subtract 10 and 6 to account for the identity element being counted multiple times.\n\nNow, let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G. Since P and Q have coprime orders, they intersect trivially, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element. Also, since n_3 = 10 and n_5 = 6, there exists a normal Sylow 3-subgroup P' and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup Q' in G.\n\nNow, consider the set PQ = {pq | p ∈ P', q ∈ Q'}. Since |P'| = 3 and |Q'| = 5, we have |PQ| = 15. Moreover, since P' and Q' are normal in G, PQ is a subgroup of G. Thus, G has a subgroup of order 15, which is a semi-direct product of P' and Q'. Since P' and Q' are both abelian, the only way for G to be non-abelian is if the action of P' on Q' is non-trivial.\n\nLet ϕ: P' → Aut(Q') be the action of P' on Q'. Since |P'| = 3 and |Q'| = 5, we have |Aut(Q')| = 4. The only non-trivial homomorphism ϕ: P' → Aut(Q') is given by ϕ(p) = q ↦ q^2 for p ∈ P', q ∈ Q'. This action makes G non-abelian.\n\nThus, there exists only one non-abelian group of order 30 up to isomorphism, which is the semi-direct product of a normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup with the non-trivial action described above."
