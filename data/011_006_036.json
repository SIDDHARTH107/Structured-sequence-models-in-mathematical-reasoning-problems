    "message_2": "To find the number of different color combinations the student can choose, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 (total number of different colored marbles) and k = 2 (the student wants to choose two different colors).\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!)\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!4!)\n\nC(6, 2) = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(6, 2) = (720) / (2 × 24)\n\nC(6, 2) = 720 / 48\n\nC(6, 2) = 15\n\nSo, the student can choose 15 different color combinations out of six different colored marbles."
