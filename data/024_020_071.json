    "message_2": "The Hopf map, also known as the Hopf fibration, is a map from the 3-sphere (S^3) to the 2-sphere (S^2). In this case, M is a 3-dimensional sphere of radius 2 centered at the origin in R^4, which can be represented as S^3 with radius 2. The Hopf map can be defined as follows:\n\nLet p: S^3 â†’ S^2 be the Hopf map, where S^3 is a subset of the complex plane C^2, and S^2 is a subset of the complex plane C. We can represent a point in S^3 as a pair of complex numbers (z1, z2), and a point in S^2 as a complex number w. The Hopf map can be defined as:\n\np(z1, z2) = z1 * conj(z2)\n\nwhere conj(z) denotes the complex conjugate of z.\n\nNow, we need to find the Hopf map of M, which is a 3-dimensional sphere of radius 2 centered at the origin in R^4. We can represent a point in M as a pair of complex numbers (z1, z2) such that |z1|^2 + |z2|^2 = 4 (since the radius is 2).\n\nThe Hopf map of M can be obtained by applying the above definition of the Hopf map to the points in M:\n\np(z1, z2) = z1 * conj(z2) for (z1, z2) in M\n\nThis is the Hopf map of the 3-dimensional sphere of radius 2 centered at the origin in R^4."
