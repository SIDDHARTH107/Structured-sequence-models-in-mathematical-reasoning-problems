    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 4, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the second derivative, f''(x).\n\n1. Find the first derivative, f'(x):\nUsing the power rule, we have:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4) + d/dx(2x^3) - d/dx(5x^2) + d/dx(7x) - d/dx(4)\nf'(x) = 12x^3 + 6x^2 - 10x + 7\n\n2. Find the second derivative, f''(x):\nAgain, using the power rule, we have:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3) + d/dx(6x^2) - d/dx(10x) + d/dx(7)\nf''(x) = 36x^2 + 12x - 10\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the second derivative at x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 36(2)^2 + 12(2) - 10\nf''(2) = 36(4) + 24 - 10\nf''(2) = 144 + 24 - 10\nf''(2) = 158\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 4 at x = 2 is 158."
