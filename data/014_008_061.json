    "message_2": "To determine the number of blocks needed for encryption, you need to divide the message length by the block length.\n\nMessage length = 512 bits\nBlock length = 64 bits\n\nNumber of blocks = Message length / Block length = 512 bits / 64 bits = 8 blocks\n\nSo, 8 blocks will be needed for encryption."
