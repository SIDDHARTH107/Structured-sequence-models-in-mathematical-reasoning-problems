    "message_1": "Suppose a transposition cipher was performed on the word \"MATHEMATICS\" by writing it vertically in columns of 3 letters and then transposing the columns to create a new word. If the resulting word is \"TMCAEIMSHAT\", what was the original order of the letters in the word \"MATHEMATICS\"?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the transposition cipher. We know that the original word \"MATHEMATICS\" was written vertically in columns of 3 letters. Since the word has 11 letters, it would form 4 columns, with the last column having only 2 letters. The transposed word is \"TMCAEIMSHAT\".\n\nLet's arrange the transposed word in columns of 3 letters, except for the last column which will have 2 letters:\n\nT M C\nA E I\nM S H\nA T\n\nNow, we need to transpose the columns back to their original order. Since the original word \"MATHEMATICS\" starts with \"M\", we can see that the first column should be the one starting with \"M\":\n\nM A T\nA E I\nT M C\nS H\n\nNow, we can read the original word horizontally:\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nSo, the original order of the letters in the word \"MATHEMATICS\" is:\n\nM A T H E M A T I C S"
