Consider the tensor field $T = (5x+2y)\\partial/\\partial x \\otimes dx + (9x-y)\\partial/\\partial y \\otimes dy$. Find the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to the Levi-Civita connection associated with the Euclidean metric on $M$ at the point $(1,2)$.",
    "message_2": "To find the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the Levi-Civita connection associated with the Euclidean metric on $M$, we first need to compute the Christoffel symbols for the Euclidean metric. In the Euclidean metric, the metric tensor is given by:\n\n$g = dx^2 + dy^2$\n\nThe Christoffel symbols are defined as:\n\n$\\Gamma^i_{jk} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{il} (\\frac{\\partial g_{lj}}{\\partial x^k} + \\frac{\\partial g_{lk}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{jk}}{\\partial x^l})$\n\nSince the Euclidean metric is flat, all the Christoffel symbols are zero:\n\n$\\Gamma^i_{jk} = 0$\n\nNow, we can compute the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$. For a (1,1)-tensor field like $T$, the covariant derivative is given by:\n\n$(\\nabla_i T)^j_k = \\frac{\\partial T^j_k}{\\partial x^i} + \\Gamma^j_{il} T^l_k - \\Gamma^l_{ik} T^j_l$\n\nUsing the fact that the Christoffel symbols are zero, this simplifies to:\n\n$(\\nabla_i T)^j_k = \\frac{\\partial T^j_k}{\\partial x^i}$\n\nNow, we can compute the partial derivatives of the components of $T$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (5x+2y)}{\\partial x} = 5$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (5x+2y)}{\\partial y} = 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (9x-y)}{\\partial x} = 9$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (9x-y)}{\\partial y} = -1$\n\nSo, the covariant derivative of $T$ is given by:\n\n$(\\nabla T) = 5 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\otimes dx \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\otimes dy \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 9 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\otimes dx \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - 1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\otimes dy \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$\n\nFinally, we need to evaluate the covariant derivative of $T$ at the point $(1,2)$. Since the covariant derivative does not depend on the coordinates, its value is the same at any point. Therefore, the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to the Levi-Civita connection associated with the Euclidean metric on $M$ at the point $(1,2)$ is:\n\n$(\\nabla T) = 5 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\otimes dx \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\otimes dy \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 9 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\otimes dx \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - 1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\otimes dy \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$"
