    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx), we'll first differentiate both sides of the given equation with respect to x using implicit differentiation. \n\nThe given equation is:\nx^2 * y - y^2 * sin(x) = 5\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x, we get:\n(d/dx)(x^2 * y) - (d/dx)(y^2 * sin(x)) = (d/dx)(5)\n\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, we have:\n[(2x * y) + (x^2 * dy/dx)] - [(2y * dy/dx * sin(x)) + (y^2 * cos(x))] = 0\n\nNow, we need to find dy/dx at the point (pi, 1). So, we'll substitute x = pi and y = 1 into the equation:\n\n(2 * pi * 1) + (pi^2 * dy/dx) - (2 * 1 * dy/dx * sin(pi)) - (1^2 * cos(pi)) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n(2 * pi) + (pi^2 * dy/dx) - (0) - (-1) = 0\n\nNow, solve for dy/dx:\n(2 * pi) + 1 = (pi^2 * dy/dx)\n\nDivide both sides by pi^2:\ndy/dx = (2 * pi + 1) / pi^2\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x (dy/dx) at the point (pi, 1) is:\ndy/dx = (2 * pi + 1) / pi^2"
