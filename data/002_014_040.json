    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. Top and bottom faces: length x width = 8 cm x 5 cm = 40 cm²\n2. Front and back faces: length x height = 8 cm x 4 cm = 32 cm²\n3. Left and right faces: width x height = 5 cm x 4 cm = 20 cm²\n\nNow, we add the areas of each pair of faces together:\n\nSurface area = 2(40 cm²) + 2(32 cm²) + 2(20 cm²) = 80 cm² + 64 cm² + 40 cm² = 184 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 184 cm²."
