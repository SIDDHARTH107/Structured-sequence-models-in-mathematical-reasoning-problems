    "message_2": "To find the amplitudes of the harmonics present in the sound wave produced by the vibrating string, we need to analyze the waveform of the sound. In this case, we assume the waveform to be a sum of sinusoidal functions representing the fundamental frequency and its harmonics.\n\nLet x(t) be the waveform of the sound produced by the vibrating string. The Fourier transform of x(t) is given by:\n\nX(f) = ∫ x(t) * e^(-j2πft) dt\n\nwhere X(f) is the Fourier transform of x(t), f is the frequency, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nSince the string is perfectly stretched with no damping, we can assume that the waveform is a sum of sinusoidal functions representing the fundamental frequency (440 Hz) and its harmonics. The harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, i.e., 2*440 Hz, 3*440 Hz, 4*440 Hz, and so on.\n\nx(t) = A1 * sin(2π * 440 * t) + A2 * sin(2π * 2 * 440 * t) + A3 * sin(2π * 3 * 440 * t) + ...\n\nTo find the amplitudes of the harmonics (A1, A2, A3, ...), we can use the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nx(t) = (1/2π) * ∫ X(f) * e^(j2πft) df\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of the sinusoidal functions in the original waveform x(t) and the inverse Fourier transform, we can find the amplitudes of the harmonics.\n\nHowever, without the actual waveform data or more information about the specific guitar string and how it was plucked, we cannot compute the exact amplitudes of the harmonics. In practice, the amplitudes of the harmonics would be determined by analyzing the waveform data obtained from the sound produced by the vibrating string."
