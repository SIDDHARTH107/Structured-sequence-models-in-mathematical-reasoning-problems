    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups: There are 6 abelian groups of order 120 (up to isomorphism): Z_120, Z_2 × Z_60, Z_4 × Z_30, Z_8 × Z_15, Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_30, and Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_15.\n3. Determine the number of possible non-abelian groups: We can use the Sylow theorems to find the possible non-abelian groups. There are 13 non-abelian groups of order 120 (up to isomorphism): A_5, S_5, SL(2,5), D_6 × Z_20, D_10 × Z_12, D_30 × Z_4, D_60 × Z_2, Z_2 × A_5, Z_2 × S_5, Z_2 × SL(2,5), Z_4 × A_5, Z_4 × S_5, and Z_4 × SL(2,5).\n\nSo, there are a total of 6 (abelian) + 13 (non-abelian) = 19 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
