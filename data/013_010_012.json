The demand for gasoline is given by:\n\nQ = 100 - P\n\nwhere Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price of gasoline. The total cost of producing Q units of gasoline by A and B are given as:\n\nCA(Q) = 10Q + Q^2\nCB(Q) = 5Q + 2Q^2\n\nWhat will be the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm? What will be the market price of gasoline? \n\n(Note: In Cournot competition, firms compete with each other by choosing the quantity of output they will produce, rather than the price they will charge.)",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm and the market price of gasoline, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the reaction functions for each firm.\n2. Solve for the Nash equilibrium by equating the reaction functions.\n3. Calculate the market price using the demand function.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction functions for each firm.\n\nTo find the reaction function for each firm, we need to find the profit-maximizing quantity for each firm, given the quantity produced by the other firm. We start by finding the profit functions for each firm:\n\nProfit_A = Revenue_A - Cost_A\nProfit_B = Revenue_B - Cost_B\n\nRevenue is calculated as Price * Quantity. Since the demand function is Q = 100 - P, we can rewrite it as P = 100 - Q. The total quantity produced in the market is Q_A + Q_B, so we can rewrite the price function as P = 100 - (Q_A + Q_B).\n\nNow, we can find the revenue functions for each firm:\n\nRevenue_A = P * Q_A = (100 - (Q_A + Q_B)) * Q_A\nRevenue_B = P * Q_B = (100 - (Q_A + Q_B)) * Q_B\n\nNext, we substitute the cost functions into the profit functions:\n\nProfit_A = (100 - (Q_A + Q_B)) * Q_A - (10Q_A + Q_A^2)\nProfit_B = (100 - (Q_A + Q_B)) * Q_B - (5Q_B + 2Q_B^2)\n\nStep 2: Solve for the Nash equilibrium by equating the reaction functions.\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we need to find the first-order conditions for each firm by taking the partial derivatives of the profit functions with respect to their respective quantities:\n\nd(Profit_A)/dQ_A = 100 - 2Q_A - Q_B - 10 = 0\nd(Profit_B)/dQ_B = 100 - Q_A - 2Q_B - 5 = 0\n\nNow, we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (Q_A and Q_B):\n\n2Q_A + Q_B = 90\nQ_A + 2Q_B = 95\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find:\n\nQ_A = 30\nQ_B = 32.5\n\nStep 3: Calculate the market price using the demand function.\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium quantities for each firm, we can find the market price using the demand function:\n\nP = 100 - (Q_A + Q_B) = 100 - (30 + 32.5) = 100 - 62.5 = 37.5\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantity produced by firm A is 30 units, the equilibrium quantity produced by firm B is 32.5 units, and the market price of gasoline is $37.5 per unit."
