    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we need to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2. This will give us:\n\n4x + 6y = 16 (1)\n\n4x - 5y = -7 (2)\n\nNow, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x - 5y) = 16 - (-7)\n\n4x + 6y - 4x + 5y = 23\n\n11y = 23\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 23 / 11\n\ny = 2\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for x. We will use equation (1):\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n\n2x + 3(2) = 8\n\n2x + 6 = 8\n\n2x = 2\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 1 and y = 2."
