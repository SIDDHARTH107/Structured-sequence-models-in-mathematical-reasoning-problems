    "message_1": "A 50 Newton force is applied to a 10 kg box, initially at rest, that moves along a straight line for a distance of 5 meters. Find the work done by the force on the box using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force on the box using integration, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = ∫F(x)dx from x=0 to x=5\n\nSince the force is constant (50 N) and the box moves along a straight line, the force function F(x) is simply:\n\nF(x) = 50 N\n\nNow, we can integrate the force function with respect to x:\n\nWork = ∫(50)dx from x=0 to x=5\n\nWork = [50x] from x=0 to x=5\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = (50 * 5) - (50 * 0)\n\nWork = 250 - 0\n\nWork = 250 J\n\nSo, the work done by the force on the box is 250 Joules."
