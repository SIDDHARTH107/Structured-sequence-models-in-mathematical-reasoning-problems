    "message_1": "A company wants to minimize the cost of its production process by optimizing the proportion of two raw materials. Material A costs $100 per unit and Material B costs $150 per unit. The company needs to use at least 500 units of Material A and 300 units of Material B in the production process. The production process has a random component, with the amount of required material A fluctuating between 500 and 700 units and the amount of material B fluctuating between 300 and 500 units each day. The company wants to find the optimal ratio of material A to material B to minimize the expected daily cost. What is the optimal proportion of Material A to Material B the company should use to minimize the expected daily cost of production?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Material A and y be the number of units of Material B. The cost function is given by:\n\nCost = 100x + 150y\n\nWe want to minimize this cost function subject to the constraints:\n\n500 ≤ x ≤ 700\n300 ≤ y ≤ 500\n\nWe can rewrite the cost function as:\n\ny = (Cost - 100x) / 150\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal ratio of x to y, which can be represented as x/y. To minimize the cost, we should minimize the ratio x/y.\n\nLet's find the average values of x and y:\n\nx_avg = (500 + 700) / 2 = 600\ny_avg = (300 + 500) / 2 = 400\n\nNow, let's find the optimal ratio:\n\nOptimal ratio = x_avg / y_avg = 600 / 400 = 3 / 2\n\nSo, the optimal proportion of Material A to Material B is 3:2. This means that for every 3 units of Material A, the company should use 2 units of Material B to minimize the expected daily cost of production."
