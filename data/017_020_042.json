    "message_2": "To find the order of the center Z(G) of the group G, we will use the class equation. The class equation is given by:\n\n|G| = |Z(G)| + ∑[G:C(x)]\n\nwhere |G| is the order of the group G, |Z(G)| is the order of the center Z(G), and the sum is taken over all distinct conjugacy classes C(x) of G with x not in Z(G).\n\nSince |G| = 40, we know that the order of the center Z(G) must divide 40. The possible divisors of 40 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.\n\nNow, we will use the fact that the order of the center Z(G) is the same as the number of elements that commute with every other element in the group. If G is abelian, then every element commutes with every other element, and Z(G) = G. In this case, G would be isomorphic to the cyclic group C40.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then Z(G) ≠ G. We will now consider the possibilities for the order of Z(G) in the non-abelian case.\n\n1. If |Z(G)| = 1, then G is a non-abelian simple group. However, there are no non-abelian simple groups of order 40, so this case is not possible.\n\n2. If |Z(G)| = 2, then G is a non-abelian group with a center of order 2. This is not possible since the center of a group is always a normal subgroup, and a normal subgroup of order 2 in a group of order 40 would imply that G is a direct product of two groups of orders 2 and 20, which would make G abelian, contradicting our assumption.\n\n3. If |Z(G)| = 4, then G is a non-abelian group with a center of order 4. In this case, G could be isomorphic to one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40.\n\n4. If |Z(G)| = 5, 8, 10, 20, or 40, then G would be abelian, contradicting our assumption.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that if G is non-abelian, then the order of the center Z(G) must be 4, and G could be isomorphic to one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40. If G is abelian, then the order of the center Z(G) is 40, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40. We cannot determine whether G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D20 without more information."
