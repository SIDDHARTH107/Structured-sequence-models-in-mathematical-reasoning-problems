    "message_2": "To find the total number of units produced, we can multiply the production rate (200 units per hour) by the number of hours the factory runs (8 hours).\n\n200 units/hour * 8 hours = 1600 units\n\nSo, the factory would produce 1600 units in 8 hours, assuming there are no disruptions or downtime."
