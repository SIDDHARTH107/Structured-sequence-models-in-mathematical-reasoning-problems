Calculate the correlation coefficient and determine if there is a positive or negative correlation between the two variables. \n\n| Hours Studied | Exam Score |\n|---------------|------------|\n| 2             | 63         |\n| 4             | 72         |\n| 6             | 89         |\n| 8             | 94         |\n| 10            | 96         |\n| 12            | 98         |\n| 14            | 97         |\n| 16            | 94         |\n| 18            | 92         |\n| 20            | 87         |",
    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (r), we will first find the mean of both the variables (hours studied and exam scores), then find the deviations from the mean, multiply the deviations, and finally calculate the correlation coefficient using the formula:\n\nr = Σ[(x - x̄)(y - ȳ)] / √[Σ(x - x̄)² * Σ(y - ȳ)²]\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean of both variables\nx̄ (mean of hours studied) = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 20) / 10 = 110 / 10 = 11\nȳ (mean of exam scores) = (63 + 72 + 89 + 94 + 96 + 98 + 97 + 94 + 92 + 87) / 10 = 882 / 10 = 88.2\n\nStep 2: Calculate the deviations from the mean\n| Hours Studied | Exam Score | x - x̄ | y - ȳ  | (x - x̄)(y - ȳ) |\n|---------------|------------|-------|-------|---------------|\n| 2             | 63         | -9    | -25.2 | 226.8         |\n| 4             | 72         | -7    | -16.2 | 113.4         |\n| 6             | 89         | -5    | 0.8   | -4            |\n| 8             | 94         | -3    | 5.8   | -17.4         |\n| 10            | 96         | -1    | 7.8   | -7.8          |\n| 12            | 98         | 1     | 9.8   | 9.8           |\n| 14            | 97         | 3     | 8.8   | 26.4          |\n| 16            | 94         | 5     | 5.8   | 29            |\n| 18            | 92         | 7     | 3.8   | 26.6          |\n| 20            | 87         | 9     | -1.2  | -10.8         |\n\nStep 3: Calculate the sum of the product of deviations\nΣ(x - x̄)(y - ȳ) = 226.8 + 113.4 - 4 - 17.4 - 7.8 + 9.8 + 26.4 + 29 + 26.6 - 10.8 = 392.6\n\nStep 4: Calculate the sum of squared deviations\nΣ(x - x̄)² = (-9)² + (-7)² + (-5)² + (-3)² + (-1)² + 1² + 3² + 5² + 7² + 9² = 285\nΣ(y - ȳ)² = (-25.2)² + (-16.2)² + 0.8² + 5.8² + 7.8² + 9.8² + 8.8² + 5.8² + 3.8² + (-1.2)² = 1170.8\n\nStep 5: Calculate the correlation coefficient (r)\nr = Σ(x - x̄)(y - ȳ) / √[Σ(x - x̄)² * Σ(y - ȳ)²] = 392.6 / √(285 * 1170.8) ≈ 0.62\n\nThe correlation coefficient (r) is approximately 0.62, which indicates a positive correlation between the number of hours studied and the final exam scores. This means that as the number of hours studied increases, the exam scores tend to increase as well."
