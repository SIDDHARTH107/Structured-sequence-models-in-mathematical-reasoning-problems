    "message_2": "To find the degree sequence of the graph G, we need to count the number of edges connected to each vertex. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. Let's count the degrees for each vertex:\n\n1. Vertex 1 has edges {1,2}, {1,3}, and {10,1}, so its degree is 3.\n2. Vertex 2 has edges {1,2} and {2,4}, so its degree is 2.\n3. Vertex 3 has edges {1,3} and {3,4}, so its degree is 2.\n4. Vertex 4 has edges {2,4}, {3,4}, {4,5}, and {4,6}, so its degree is 4.\n5. Vertex 5 has edges {4,5} and {5,7}, so its degree is 2.\n6. Vertex 6 has edges {4,6} and {6,7}, so its degree is 2.\n7. Vertex 7 has edges {5,7}, {6,7}, {7,8}, and {7,9}, so its degree is 4.\n8. Vertex 8 has edges {7,8} and {8,10}, so its degree is 2.\n9. Vertex 9 has edges {7,9} and {9,10}, so its degree is 2.\n10. Vertex 10 has edges {8,10}, {9,10}, and {10,1}, so its degree is 3.\n\nNow we can list the degrees in non-increasing order to get the degree sequence: (4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)."
