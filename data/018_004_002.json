    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Since set A contains whole numbers from 1 to 10, let's consider the universal set U to be the set of all whole numbers from 1 to 20. \n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}\n\nNow, the complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nSo, A' = {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}\n\nNow, to prove that the complement of set A is unique, we need to show that there cannot be another set B' that is also the complement of set A with respect to the universal set U.\n\nAssume there exists another set B' that is also the complement of set A with respect to U. This means that B' contains all the elements in U that are not in set A. Since A and A' together contain all the elements in U, B' must be equal to A'. \n\nHowever, if B' is equal to A', then there is no other set that can be the complement of set A with respect to U. This contradicts our assumption that there exists another set B' that is also the complement of set A. Therefore, the complement of set A is unique, and it is the set A' = {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}."
