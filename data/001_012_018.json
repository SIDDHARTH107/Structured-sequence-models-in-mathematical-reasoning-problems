    "message_2": "To simplify the rational expression (6x^2 + 12x) / (3x^2), first factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from the numerator:\n\n6x^2 + 12x = 6x(x + 2)\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n(6x(x + 2)) / (3x^2)\n\nNext, simplify by dividing the common factors:\n\n(6x/3x^2) * (x + 2)\n\n2/x * (x + 2)\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n2( x + 2) / x"
