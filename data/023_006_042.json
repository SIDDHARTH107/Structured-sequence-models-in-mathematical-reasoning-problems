    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given periodic signal x(t), we need to find the Fourier series coefficients. Since the signal is periodic with period T = 2π, we can use the Fourier series representation:\n\nx(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(nω₀t) + bn * sin(nω₀t)]\n\nwhere ω₀ = 2π/T = 1, and the coefficients are given by:\n\na0 = (1/T) * ∫[x(t) dt] over one period\nan = (2/T) * ∫[x(t) * cos(nω₀t) dt] over one period\nbn = (2/T) * ∫[x(t) * sin(nω₀t) dt] over one period\n\nFirst, let's find a0:\n\na0 = (1/2π) * [∫[-5 dt] from -π to 0 + ∫[5 dt] from 0 to π]\na0 = (1/2π) * [-5t | from -π to 0 + 5t | from 0 to π]\na0 = (1/2π) * [0 - (-5π) + 5π - 0]\na0 = (1/2π) * 10π\na0 = 5\n\nNow, let's find an:\n\nan = (2/2π) * [∫[-5 * cos(nt) dt] from -π to 0 + ∫[5 * cos(nt) dt] from 0 to π]\nan = (1/π) * [∫[-5 * cos(nt) dt] from -π to 0 + ∫[5 * cos(nt) dt] from 0 to π]\n\nIntegrating cos(nt) with respect to t gives (1/n) * sin(nt). So,\n\nan = (1/π) * [-5/n * sin(nt) | from -π to 0 + 5/n * sin(nt) | from 0 to π]\nan = (1/π) * [(-5/n) * (sin(nπ) - sin(0)) + (5/n) * (sin(nπ) - sin(0))]\nan = (1/π) * [0 + 0] (since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n)\nan = 0\n\nNow, let's find bn:\n\nbn = (2/2π) * [∫[-5 * sin(nt) dt] from -π to 0 + ∫[5 * sin(nt) dt] from 0 to π]\nbn = (1/π) * [∫[-5 * sin(nt) dt] from -π to 0 + ∫[5 * sin(nt) dt] from 0 to π]\n\nIntegrating sin(nt) with respect to t gives (-1/n) * cos(nt). So,\n\nbn = (1/π) * [5/n * cos(nt) | from -π to 0 - 5/n * cos(nt) | from 0 to π]\nbn = (1/π) * [(5/n) * (cos(0) - cos(-nπ)) - (5/n) * (cos(nπ) - cos(0))]\nbn = (1/π) * [(5/n) * (1 - cos(-nπ)) - (5/n) * (cos(nπ) - 1)]\n\nSince cos(-nπ) = cos(nπ) for all integer values of n, we can simplify this expression:\n\nbn = (1/π) * [(5/n) * (1 - cos(nπ)) - (5/n) * (cos(nπ) - 1)]\nbn = (1/π) * [(5/n) * (1 - cos(nπ) - cos(nπ) + 1)]\nbn = (1/π) * [(5/n) * (2 - 2 * cos(nπ))]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series representation of x(t):\n\nx(t) = 5 + Σ[0 * cos(nt) + (1/π) * (5/n) * (2 - 2 * cos(nπ)) * sin(nt)]\n\nSimplifying the series, we get:\n\nx(t) = 5 + Σ[(10/nπ) * (1 - cos(nπ)) * sin(nt)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given periodic signal x(t)."
