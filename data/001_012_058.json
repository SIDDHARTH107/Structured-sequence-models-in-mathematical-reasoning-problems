    "message_2": "First, we need to factor both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: n^2 + 5n + 6\nWe are looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5. These numbers are 2 and 3.\nSo, we can factor the numerator as (n + 2)(n + 3).\n\nDenominator: n^2 - n - 6\nWe are looking for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add to -1. These numbers are -3 and 2.\nSo, we can factor the denominator as (n - 3)(n + 2).\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(n + 2)(n + 3) / (n - 3)(n + 2)\n\nSince n cannot be equal to 2 or -3, we can safely cancel out the common factor (n + 2) from both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n(n + 3) / (n - 3)\n\nSo, the simplified form of the rational expression is (n + 3) / (n - 3)."
