    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity with respect to the due east direction, we can use the components of the velocity vector. Since the boat is traveling at a 45-degree angle north of east, we can use trigonometry to find the eastward and northward components of the velocity.\n\nLet V_east be the eastward component of the velocity and V_north be the northward component of the velocity.\n\nV_east = V * cos(45°)\nV_north = V * sin(45°)\n\nwhere V is the magnitude of the velocity (15 m/s) and 45° is the angle north of east.\n\nUsing the sine and cosine of 45° (which are both equal to √2/2 or 0.7071), we can find the components:\n\nV_east = 15 m/s * 0.7071 ≈ 10.61 m/s\nV_north = 15 m/s * 0.7071 ≈ 10.61 m/s\n\nNow, we have the eastward and northward components of the velocity. Since we want to find the magnitude and direction of the boat's velocity with respect to the due east direction, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and the arctangent function:\n\nMagnitude: V_total = √(V_east² + V_north²)\nDirection: θ = arctan(V_north / V_east)\n\nMagnitude:\nV_total = √((10.61 m/s)² + (10.61 m/s)²) ≈ 15 m/s\n\nDirection:\nθ = arctan(10.61 m/s / 10.61 m/s) = arctan(1) = 45°\n\nSo, the magnitude of the boat's velocity with respect to the due east direction is 15 m/s, and the direction is 45° north of east."
