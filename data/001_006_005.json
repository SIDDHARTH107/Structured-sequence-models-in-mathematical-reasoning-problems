    "message_2": "To find the vertex, axis of symmetry, and maximum or minimum value of the quadratic equation y = 2x² - 4x + 3, we first need to rewrite the equation in vertex form. The vertex form of a quadratic equation is given by:\n\ny = a(x - h)² + k\n\nwhere (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola, and a is the leading coefficient.\n\nTo rewrite the given equation in vertex form, we can complete the square:\n\ny = 2x² - 4x + 3\n\ny = 2(x² - 2x) + 3\n\nNow, we need to add and subtract the square of half of the coefficient of x inside the parentheses:\n\ny = 2(x² - 2x + 1 - 1) + 3\n\ny = 2((x - 1)² - 1) + 3\n\nNow, distribute the 2:\n\ny = 2(x - 1)² - 2 + 3\n\ny = 2(x - 1)² + 1\n\nNow, we can see that the equation is in vertex form, with a = 2, h = 1, and k = 1. So, the vertex of the parabola is (1, 1).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is x = h, which in this case is x = 1.\n\nSince the leading coefficient a = 2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards, which means it has a minimum value. The minimum value of the quadratic equation is the y-coordinate of the vertex, which is k = 1.\n\nIn summary:\n- Vertex: (1, 1)\n- Axis of symmetry: x = 1\n- Minimum value: 1"
