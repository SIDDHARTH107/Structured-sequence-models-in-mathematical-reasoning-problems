    "message_2": "The given equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ defines a smooth quadric surface in the projective 3-space $\\mathbb{P}^3$. Since the variety is smooth, its intersection cohomology groups coincide with its singular cohomology groups. We can compute these using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.\n\nThe Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for a smooth projective variety $X$ of dimension $n$ in $\\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$, and a hyperplane $H \\subset \\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$, the restriction map $H^k(X) \\to H^k(X \\cap H)$ is an isomorphism for $k < n$ and injective for $k = n$. Here, $H^k(X)$ denotes the $k$-th cohomology group of $X$.\n\nIn our case, $X$ is the smooth quadric surface defined by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$, and $n = 2$. We can take the hyperplane $H$ to be defined by the equation $w = 0$. Then, $X \\cap H$ is the intersection of the quadric surface with the plane $w = 0$, which is given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$ in the affine 3-space $\\mathbb{A}^3$. This is a smooth conic in $\\mathbb{A}^3$, which is isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n\nNow, we can compute the cohomology groups of the quadric surface $X$ using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. Since $X \\cap H \\cong \\mathbb{P}^1$, we have $H^k(X \\cap H) = H^k(\\mathbb{P}^1)$. The cohomology groups of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ are given by:\n\n- $H^0(\\mathbb{P}^1) = \\mathbb{R}$,\n- $H^1(\\mathbb{P}^1) = 0$,\n- $H^2(\\mathbb{P}^1) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nBy the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, we have:\n\n- $H^0(X) = H^0(\\mathbb{P}^1) = \\mathbb{R}$,\n- $H^1(X) = H^1(\\mathbb{P}^1) = 0$,\n- $H^2(X) \\supset H^2(\\mathbb{P}^1) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo compute $H^2(X)$, we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic of a smooth quadric surface is 2. The Euler characteristic is given by the alternating sum of the Betti numbers, which are the dimensions of the cohomology groups:\n\n$\\chi(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^k \\dim H^k(X) = 2$.\n\nSince $H^0(X) = \\mathbb{R}$ and $H^1(X) = 0$, we have:\n\n$2 = \\chi(X) = 1 - 0 + \\dim H^2(X)$.\n\nThus, $\\dim H^2(X) = 1$, and $H^2(X) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn summary, the intersection cohomology groups of the quadric surface $X$ are:\n\n- $IH^0(X) = H^0(X) = \\mathbb{R}$,\n- $IH^1(X) = H^1(X) = 0$,\n- $IH^2(X) = H^2(X) = \\mathbb{R}$."
