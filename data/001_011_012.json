    "message_2": "To solve the equation (2x-5)/(x+1) = 3/2, we can start by cross-multiplying:\n\n(2x - 5) * 2 = (x + 1) * 3\n\nNow, distribute the numbers on both sides of the equation:\n\n4x - 10 = 3x + 3\n\nNext, subtract 3x from both sides to isolate x:\n\n4x - 3x - 10 = 3\n\nx - 10 = 3\n\nNow, add 10 to both sides to solve for x:\n\nx = 3 + 10\n\nx = 13\n\nSo, the solution is x = 13."
