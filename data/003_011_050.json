    "message_1": "A plane is flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet. The pilot sees a mountain peak at an angle of elevation of 30 degrees. The plane continues to fly for another 10 miles and the pilot then sees the same mountain peak at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees. What is the height of the mountain peak?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the mountain peak as h, the distance from the plane to the mountain peak when the angle of elevation is 30 degrees as x, and the distance from the plane to the mountain peak when the angle of elevation is 60 degrees as y.\n\nWhen the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, we can use the tangent function to set up the following equation:\n\ntan(30) = h / x\nx = h / tan(30)\n\nWhen the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, we can use the tangent function to set up the following equation:\n\ntan(60) = h / y\ny = h / tan(60)\n\nThe plane flies for another 10 miles between these two points, so we can write the equation:\n\nx - y = 10 miles = 52800 feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet)\n\nNow we can substitute the expressions for x and y in terms of h:\n\nh / tan(30) - h / tan(60) = 52800\n\nWe know that tan(30) = 1/sqrt(3) and tan(60) = sqrt(3), so we can substitute these values:\n\nh / (1/sqrt(3)) - h / sqrt(3) = 52800\nh * sqrt(3) - h / sqrt(3) = 52800\n\nNow we can factor h out of the equation:\n\nh (sqrt(3) - 1/sqrt(3)) = 52800\n\nNow we can simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n(sqrt(3) - 1/sqrt(3)) = (3 - 1) / sqrt(3) = 2 / sqrt(3)\n\nNow we can solve for h:\n\nh = 52800 / (2 / sqrt(3))\nh = 52800 * sqrt(3) / 2\nh = 26400 * sqrt(3)\n\nApproximating the value of sqrt(3) as 1.732:\n\nh ≈ 26400 * 1.732\nh ≈ 45708\n\nSo, the height of the mountain peak is approximately 45,708 feet."
