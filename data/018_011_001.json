    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the resulting set with the set C = {1, (2, 4)}.\n\n(A × B) ∩ C = {(2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's prove that the Cartesian product of A and C intersects the Cartesian product of B and C in exactly the same way as the Cartesian product of (A ∩ C) and (B ∩ C).\n\nFirst, let's find the Cartesian products of A and C, and B and C:\n\nA × C = {(1, 1), (1, (2, 4)), (2, 1), (2, (2, 4))}\nB × C = {(3, 1), (3, (2, 4)), (4, 1), (4, (2, 4))}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of these two Cartesian products:\n\n(A × C) ∩ (B × C) = {(2, (2, 4))}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and C, and B and C:\n\nA ∩ C = {1}\nB ∩ C = ∅ (empty set)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ C) and (B ∩ C):\n\n(A ∩ C) × (B ∩ C) = ∅ (empty set)\n\nSince the intersection of A and C is {1}, and the intersection of B and C is the empty set, their Cartesian product is also the empty set. This means that there is no intersection between the Cartesian product of A and C and the Cartesian product of B and C in the same way as the Cartesian product of (A ∩ C) and (B ∩ C).\n\nHowever, we can see that the intersection of (A × B) and C is the same as the intersection of (A × C) and (B × C), which is {(2, (2, 4))}."
