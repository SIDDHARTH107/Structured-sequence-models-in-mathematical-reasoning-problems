The rod is placed in a heat bath at 20°C. The temperature at the ends of the rod is kept constant during the process. If the initial temperature distribution of the rod is given by T(x) = 100 sin(πx/L), where L is the length of the rod, find the temperature distribution T(x) for the rod at a time t = 10 seconds using heat transfer and diffusion equations. The thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.1 cm²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x, t) is the temperature distribution, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the position along the rod.\n\nThe initial condition is given by T(x, 0) = 100 sin(πx/L), and the boundary conditions are T(0, t) = T(L, t) = 20°C.\n\nWe can solve the heat equation using separation of variables. Let T(x, t) = X(x)T(t), then we have:\n\nX(x) ∂T(t)/∂t = α T(t) ∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nDivide both sides by αXT to get:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X) ∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Now we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X) ∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nSolving the first equation for T(t), we get:\n\n∂T(t)/∂t = -αλ²T(t)\n\nT(t) = Ce^(-αλ²t)\n\nSolving the second equation for X(x), we get:\n\n∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²X(x)\n\nX(x) = A sin(λx) + B cos(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we have:\n\nX(0) = B = 20\nX(L) = A sin(λL) + 20 = 20\n\nSince X(L) = 20, we have A sin(λL) = 0. Since L ≠ 0, we must have sin(λL) = 0, which implies λL = nπ for some integer n. Thus, λ = nπ/L.\n\nThe general solution is a sum of solutions for each value of n:\n\nT(x, t) = 20 + Σ [C_n sin(nπx/L) e^(-αn²π²t/L²)]\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 100 sin(πx/L):\n\n100 sin(πx/L) = 20 + Σ [C_n sin(nπx/L)]\n\nComparing the terms, we see that C_1 = 80 and C_n = 0 for n > 1. Therefore, the temperature distribution T(x, t) is:\n\nT(x, t) = 20 + 80 sin(πx/L) e^(-απ²t/L²)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values: L = 20 cm, α = 0.1 cm²/s, and t = 10 s:\n\nT(x, 10) = 20 + 80 sin(πx/20) e^(-0.1π²(10)/20²)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution T(x) for the rod at a time t = 10 seconds."
