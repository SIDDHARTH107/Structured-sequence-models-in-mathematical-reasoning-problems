    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(nx) dx (for n = 0, 1, 2, ...)\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx (for n = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n\nFirst, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(nx) dx\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x dx = 0 (since the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero)\n\nFor n > 0:\na_n = (1/π) * [x * (sin(nx)/n) + (cos(nx)/n^2)] [-π, π]\na_n = 0 (since both terms are odd functions)\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * [-x * (cos(nx)/n) + (sin(nx)/n^2)] [-π, π]\nb_n = (2/π) * [(π^2 * n - sin(π * n))/(n^3)] (since cos(n * π) = (-1)^n)\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x is:\n\nf(x) = ∑[(2/π) * ((π^2 * n - sin(π * n))/(n^3)) * sin(nx)] (for n = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n\nNow, let's solve the partial differential equation u_t = u_xx with initial condition u(x, 0) = x + 1 and boundary conditions u(-π, t) = u(π, t) = 0 for all t > 0.\n\nSince u(x, 0) = x + 1, we need to find the Fourier series representation of x + 1:\n\ng(x) = x + 1 = ∑[(2/π) * ((π^2 * n - sin(π * n))/(n^3)) * sin(nx)] (for n = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n\nNow, we can use the method of separation of variables to solve the PDE. Let u(x, t) = X(x) * T(t). Then:\n\nX(x) * T'(t) = X''(x) * T(t)\n\nDivide both sides by X(x) * T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x) = -λ\n\nSolving the ODEs:\n\nX''(x) + λX(x) = 0\nT'(t) + λT(t) = 0\n\nSince u(-π, t) = u(π, t) = 0, we have the boundary conditions X(-π) = X(π) = 0. This implies that λ = n^2 for some integer n, and X(x) = sin(nx).\n\nNow, we can solve for T(t):\n\nT'(t) + n^2 * T(t) = 0\nT(t) = Ce^(-n^2 * t)\n\nThus, the solution to the PDE is:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[A_n * sin(nx) * e^(-n^2 * t)]\n\nwhere A_n = (2/π) * ((π^2 * n - sin(π * n))/(n^3)).\n\nSo, the solution to the given PDE with the initial and boundary conditions is:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[(2/π) * ((π^2 * n - sin(π * n))/(n^3)) * sin(nx) * e^(-n^2 * t)] (for n = 1, 2, 3, ...)"
