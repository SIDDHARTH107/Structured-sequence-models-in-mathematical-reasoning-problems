    "message_2": "To find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ in the unit circle, we can use the properties of special triangles, specifically the 45-45-90 triangle.\n\nFirst, let's convert the angle to degrees: $\\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\cdot \\frac{180}{\\pi} = 135^\\circ$. This angle is in the second quadrant of the unit circle, where sine is positive, cosine is negative, and tangent is negative.\n\nNow, let's consider a 45-45-90 triangle. In this triangle, the angles are $45^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, and $90^\\circ$. The sides are in the ratio $1:1:\\sqrt{2}$, meaning that if the two legs have length 1, the hypotenuse has length $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince the angle $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ (or $135^\\circ$) is $45^\\circ$ more than $90^\\circ$, we can use the 45-45-90 triangle to find the sine, cosine, and tangent of this angle.\n\nThe sine of the angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side is 1, and the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$. So, $\\sin{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nThe cosine of the angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In this case, the adjacent side is -1 (since we are in the second quadrant), and the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$. So, $\\cos{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nThe tangent of the angle is the ratio of the sine to the cosine. So, $\\tan{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}} = \\frac{\\sin{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}}{\\cos{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = -1$.\n\nThus, the sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ are $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, $-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, and $-1$, respectively."
