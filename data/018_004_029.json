    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Since A is a set of integers, we can assume that U is the set of all integers, i.e., U = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}.\n\nThe complement of set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. In other words, A' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}.\n\nNow, we can find the complement of set A by listing all the integers that are not in A:\n\nA' = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 6, 7, 8, ...}\n\nTo prove that the complement of set A is unique, we need to show that there is only one set A' that satisfies the definition of a complement.\n\nSuppose there is another set B that is also a complement of set A. By definition, B must contain all the elements in U that are not in A. Since A' also contains all the elements in U that are not in A, it follows that A' and B must have the same elements. Therefore, A' = B.\n\nSince there is only one set A' that satisfies the definition of a complement, the complement of set A is unique."
