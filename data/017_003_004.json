    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince G is a group of order 7, we know that |G| = 7, where |G| denotes the order of the group. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element g in G must divide the order of G. The only divisors of 7 are 1 and 7, since 7 is a prime number.\n\nNow, let's consider an arbitrary element g in G. If the order of g is 1, then g must be the identity element e of G. However, if the order of g is 7, then g generates a subgroup of G with 7 elements, which must be G itself (since G has only 7 elements).\n\nWe know that there must be at least one element in G with order 7, because if all elements had order 1, then G would only consist of the identity element, which contradicts the fact that |G| = 7. Therefore, there exists an element g in G with order 7, and G is generated by this element, making G a cyclic group."
