    "message_2": "For a second-order reaction, the integrated rate law is given by:\n\n1/[A]t = kt + 1/[A]0\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration of the reactant at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of the reactant, k is the rate constant, and t is the time.\n\nWe are given the initial concentration [A]0 = 0.1 M, the concentration after 10 minutes [A]t = 0.04 M, and the rate constant k = 0.05 L/mol/min. We can use this information to find the half-life (t1/2) of the reaction.\n\nFirst, let's plug in the given values into the integrated rate law equation:\n\n1/0.04 = (0.05 L/mol/min)(10 min) + 1/0.1\n\nSolving for the equation:\n\n25 = 0.5 + 10\n\n24.5 = 10\n\nNow, let's find the half-life. For a second-order reaction, the half-life is given by:\n\nt1/2 = 1/(k[A]0)\n\nWe know the rate constant k = 0.05 L/mol/min and the initial concentration [A]0 = 0.1 M. Plugging these values into the equation:\n\nt1/2 = 1/((0.05 L/mol/min)(0.1 M))\n\nt1/2 = 1/(0.005 L/mol)\n\nt1/2 = 200 min\n\nSo, the half-life of the reaction is 200 minutes."
