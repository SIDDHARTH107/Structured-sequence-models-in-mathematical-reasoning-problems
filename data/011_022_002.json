    "message_1": "A student needs to pack their backpack with a maximum weight limit of 10 kg. They have 4 items they want to bring with them, each with a weight and a value:\n\nItem 1: 3 kg, 8 dollars\n\nItem 2: 4 kg, 10 dollars\n\nItem 3: 2.5 kg, 6 dollars\n\nItem 4: 1.5 kg, 4 dollars\n\nWhat combination of items should the student bring to maximize the total value while staying under the weight limit of 10 kg?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total value while staying under the weight limit of 10 kg, we can calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item and then select the items with the highest ratios until the weight limit is reached.\n\nValue-to-weight ratios:\nItem 1: 8 dollars / 3 kg = 2.67 $/kg\nItem 2: 10 dollars / 4 kg = 2.5 $/kg\nItem 3: 6 dollars / 2.5 kg = 2.4 $/kg\nItem 4: 4 dollars / 1.5 kg = 2.67 $/kg\n\nNow, we can sort the items by their value-to-weight ratios in descending order:\nItem 1: 2.67 $/kg\nItem 4: 2.67 $/kg\nItem 2: 2.5 $/kg\nItem 3: 2.4 $/kg\n\nWe start by selecting the items with the highest value-to-weight ratios:\n1. Item 1: 3 kg, 8 dollars (remaining weight limit: 10 kg - 3 kg = 7 kg)\n2. Item 4: 1.5 kg, 4 dollars (remaining weight limit: 7 kg - 1.5 kg = 5.5 kg)\n\nNow, we can't add Item 2 (4 kg) because it would exceed the weight limit (5.5 kg + 4 kg = 9.5 kg > 10 kg). So, we move to the next highest value-to-weight ratio item:\n\n3. Item 3: 2.5 kg, 6 dollars (remaining weight limit: 5.5 kg - 2.5 kg = 3 kg)\n\nAt this point, we can't add any more items without exceeding the weight limit. So, the student should bring Items 1, 3, and 4 with a total weight of 7 kg (3 kg + 2.5 kg + 1.5 kg) and a total value of 18 dollars (8 dollars + 6 dollars + 4 dollars)."
