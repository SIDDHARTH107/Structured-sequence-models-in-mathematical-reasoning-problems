    "message_1": "A system of linear equations has been given:\n\n3x + y = 5\n\n6x + 2y = 10\n\nFind the values of x and y that satisfy the system of equations.",
    "message_2": "First, we can observe that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n3x + y = 5\n\nThis is the same as the first equation. Since both equations are the same, they represent the same line in the xy-plane. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations, as every point on the line represented by 3x + y = 5 is a solution.\n\nTo express the solutions, we can solve for y in terms of x:\n\ny = 5 - 3x\n\nNow, for any value of x, we can find the corresponding value of y that satisfies the system of equations."
