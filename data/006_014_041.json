    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one component will fail, it's easier to find the probability that none of the components will fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single component will not fail is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince there are 10 components, the probability that all of them will not fail is (0.95)^10.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one component will fail:\n\nP(at least one failure) = 1 - P(no failures)\nP(at least one failure) = 1 - (0.95)^10\n\nCalculating (0.95)^10:\n(0.95)^10 ≈ 0.5987369\n\nNow, subtract that from 1:\nP(at least one failure) = 1 - 0.5987369\nP(at least one failure) ≈ 0.4012631\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the components will fail is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
