    "message_1": "A company is deciding whether to invest in two potential projects. Project A requires an initial investment of $50,000 and has a 60% chance of generating a profit of $80,000. Project B requires an initial investment of $80,000 and has a 75% chance of generating a profit of $100,000. Which project should the company choose according to the expected value criterion?",
    "message_2": "To determine which project the company should choose according to the expected value criterion, we need to calculate the expected value for each project. The expected value is calculated as the probability of success multiplied by the potential profit minus the initial investment.\n\nProject A:\nExpected Value (EV) = (Probability of Success * Profit) - Initial Investment\nEV_A = (0.60 * $80,000) - $50,000\nEV_A = $48,000 - $50,000\nEV_A = -$2,000\n\nProject B:\nExpected Value (EV) = (Probability of Success * Profit) - Initial Investment\nEV_B = (0.75 * $100,000) - $80,000\nEV_B = $75,000 - $80,000\nEV_B = -$5,000\n\nAccording to the expected value criterion, the company should choose Project A, as it has a higher expected value of -$2,000 compared to Project B's expected value of -$5,000. However, it is important to note that both projects have negative expected values, which means that neither project is expected to generate a profit on average. The company may want to consider looking for other investment opportunities or reevaluating the projects' potential profits and probabilities of success."
