    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of non-overlapping circles that can be added to the Apollonian gasket construction with integer curvatures not exceeding 1000, we need to understand the Descartes Circle Theorem.\n\nThe Descartes Circle Theorem states that if four mutually tangent circles have curvatures k1, k2, k3, and k4, then:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nWe start with three mutually tangent circles with integer curvatures k1, k2, and k3. Let's denote the curvature of the fourth circle as k4. Using the Descartes Circle Theorem, we can find k4:\n\nk4 = (k1 + k2 + k3) Â± 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\n\nSince we are looking for integer curvatures, we need to find combinations of k1, k2, and k3 that result in an integer value for k4. One such combination is k1 = 1, k2 = 1, and k3 = 1. In this case, k4 = 5.\n\nNow, we can recursively apply the Descartes Circle Theorem to generate new circles with integer curvatures. We need to keep track of the circles generated and ensure that their curvatures do not exceed 1000.\n\nUsing a depth-first search algorithm, we can explore the possible circles that can be generated. We start with the initial set of circles with curvatures (1, 1, 1, 5) and apply the Descartes Circle Theorem to generate new circles. We continue this process until we reach a circle with a curvature greater than 1000.\n\nAfter performing this search, we find that the maximum number of non-overlapping circles that can be added to the Apollonian gasket construction with integer curvatures not exceeding 1000 is 209."
