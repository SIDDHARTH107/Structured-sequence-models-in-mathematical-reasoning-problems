    "message_2": "To calculate the correlation coefficient (r) between two variables X and Y, we can use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] / sqrt(Σ(xi - x_mean)^2 * Σ(yi - y_mean)^2)\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of X and Y:\n\nx_mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6\ny_mean = (3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11) / 5 = 35 / 5 = 7\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nNumerator:\nΣ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] = (2-6)(3-7) + (4-6)(5-7) + (6-6)(7-7) + (8-6)(9-7) + (10-6)(11-7)\n= (-4)(-4) + (-2)(-2) + (0)(0) + (2)(2) + (4)(4)\n= 16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16\n= 40\n\nDenominator:\nΣ(xi - x_mean)^2 = (-4)^2 + (-2)^2 + (0)^2 + (2)^2 + (4)^2\n= 16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16\n= 40\n\nΣ(yi - y_mean)^2 = (-4)^2 + (-2)^2 + (0)^2 + (2)^2 + (4)^2\n= 16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16\n= 40\n\nsqrt(Σ(xi - x_mean)^2 * Σ(yi - y_mean)^2) = sqrt(40 * 40) = sqrt(1600) = 40\n\nNow, let's calculate the correlation coefficient:\n\nr = 40 / 40 = 1\n\nThe correlation coefficient between X and Y is 1, which indicates a perfect positive linear relationship between the two variables."
