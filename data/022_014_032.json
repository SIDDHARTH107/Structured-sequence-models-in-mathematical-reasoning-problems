    "message_2": "Since $f(z)$ is harmonic, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the function $g(z) = f(z) - f(-z)$. Then, $g(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) - u(-x,-y) - iv(-x,-y)$. We can rewrite this as:\n\n$g(z) = (u(x,y) - u(-x,-y)) + i(v(x,y) - v(-x,-y))$.\n\nNow, let's differentiate $g(z)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(-x,-y) = 2\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}(-x,-y) = 2\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is harmonic, we know that $g(z)$ is also harmonic. Therefore, $g(z)$ satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(-x,-y) = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}(-x,-y)$,\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}(-x,-y) = -\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(-x,-y)$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate $g(z)$ at the given points:\n\n$g(1+i) = f(1+i) - f(-1-1i) = (2+i) - f(-1-1i)$,\n\n$g(-1+2i) = f(-1+2i) - f(1-2i) = (3-i) - f(1-2i)$.\n\nSince $g(z)$ is harmonic, it satisfies the mean value property, which states that the value of a harmonic function at a point is equal to the average of its values on any circle centered at that point. In this case, we can consider the circle with radius $1$ centered at the origin. The points $1+i$ and $-1+2i$ lie on this circle, so we have:\n\n$u(0,0) = \\frac{1}{2} (u(1,1) + u(-1,2))$.\n\nUsing the expressions for $g(z)$ at the given points, we can solve for $u(1,1)$ and $u(-1,2)$:\n\n$u(1,1) = \\operatorname{Re}(2+i) = 2$,\n\n$u(-1,2) = \\operatorname{Re}(3-i) = 3$.\n\nNow, we can find $u(0,0)$:\n\n$u(0,0) = \\frac{1}{2} (2 + 3) = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, $u(0,0) = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$."
