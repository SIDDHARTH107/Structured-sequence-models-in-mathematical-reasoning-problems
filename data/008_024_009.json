    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the third equation is just a multiple of the second equation (multiplied by 3). Therefore, we can eliminate the third equation as it does not provide any new information.\n\nNow we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n4x + 2y - 6z = 8\n2x + y - 3z = 4\n\nWe can simplify the first equation by dividing it by 2:\n\n2x + y - 3z = 4\n\nNow we have two identical equations:\n\n2x + y - 3z = 4\n2x + y - 3z = 4\n\nSince these equations are the same, we only need to work with one of them. Let's rewrite the equation in terms of y:\n\ny = -2x + 3z + 4\n\nThis equation represents a plane in 3D space, and there are infinitely many solutions for x, y, and z that satisfy this equation. To express all the solutions, we can write the general solution in terms of a parameter, say t:\n\nx = t\ny = -2t + 3z + 4\nz = z\n\nHere, t and z can be any real numbers. This gives us the general solution for the system of linear equations, representing all possible solutions for x, y, and z."
