    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product of two sets, we take each element from the first set and pair it with each element from the second set. Let's find A x B and B x A.\n\nA x B = {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)}\n\nB x A = {(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two sets (A x B) ∪ (B x A):\n\n(A x B) ∪ (B x A) = {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements in A x B are different from the elements in B x A. This means that the Cartesian product is not commutative with respect to union, as the union of A x B and B x A results in a different set than either A x B or B x A alone."
