    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x - 7 < 5x + 1, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the inequality. Follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 3x from both sides of the inequality.\n-7 < 2x + 1\n\nStep 2: Subtract 1 from both sides of the inequality.\n-8 < 2x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 2.\n-4 < x\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x > -4."
