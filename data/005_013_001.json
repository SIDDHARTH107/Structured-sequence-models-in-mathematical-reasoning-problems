They collected the following data:\n\n| Hours of Usage | Defective Products |\n| --------------| ------------------ |\n| 8             | 3                  |\n| 6             | 2                  |\n| 9             | 4                  |\n| 5             | 1                  |\n| 10            | 5                  |\n\nUsing Multivariate Analysis, determine the regression equation to predict the number of defective products based on the hours of usage.",
    "message_2": "To determine the regression equation, we will first calculate the means of the Hours of Usage (X) and Defective Products (Y), then find the slope (b1) and the y-intercept (b0) of the regression equation.\n\nMean of X (Hours of Usage):\n(8 + 6 + 9 + 5 + 10) / 5 = 38 / 5 = 7.6\n\nMean of Y (Defective Products):\n(3 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 5) / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3\n\nNow, we will calculate the slope (b1) using the formula:\n\nb1 = Σ[(Xi - X_mean) * (Yi - Y_mean)] / Σ[(Xi - X_mean)^2]\n\nFirst, let's calculate the numerator:\n\n(8 - 7.6) * (3 - 3) = 0.4 * 0 = 0\n(6 - 7.6) * (2 - 3) = -1.6 * -1 = 1.6\n(9 - 7.6) * (4 - 3) = 1.4 * 1 = 1.4\n(5 - 7.6) * (1 - 3) = -2.6 * -2 = 5.2\n(10 - 7.6) * (5 - 3) = 2.4 * 2 = 4.8\n\nSum of the numerator: 0 + 1.6 + 1.4 + 5.2 + 4.8 = 13\n\nNow, let's calculate the denominator:\n\n(8 - 7.6)^2 = 0.16\n(6 - 7.6)^2 = 2.56\n(9 - 7.6)^2 = 1.96\n(5 - 7.6)^2 = 6.76\n(10 - 7.6)^2 = 5.76\n\nSum of the denominator: 0.16 + 2.56 + 1.96 + 6.76 + 5.76 = 17.2\n\nNow, we can calculate the slope (b1):\n\nb1 = 13 / 17.2 = 0.7558 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nNext, we will calculate the y-intercept (b0) using the formula:\n\nb0 = Y_mean - (b1 * X_mean)\n\nb0 = 3 - (0.7558 * 7.6) = 3 - 5.7439 = -2.7439 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nNow, we have the regression equation:\n\nY = b0 + b1 * X\nY = -2.7439 + 0.7558 * X\n\nSo, the regression equation to predict the number of defective products based on the hours of usage is:\n\nDefective Products = -2.7439 + 0.7558 * Hours of Usage"
