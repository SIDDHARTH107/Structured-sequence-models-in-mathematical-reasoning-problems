    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the second equation by 3 and the third equation by -1.\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n(3)(x - 2y + 3z) &= (3)(8) \\\\\n(-1)(3x + 2y + 2z) &= (-1)(10)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n3x - 6y + 9z &= 24 \\\\\n-3x - 2y - 2z &= -10\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNow, we can add these two equations to eliminate x:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n(-6y + 9z) + (-2y - 2z) &= 24 + (-10) \\\\\n-8y + 7z &= 14\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNow, let's eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by -3 and the third equation by 2.\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n(-3)(2x + 3y - z) &= (-3)(7) \\\\\n(2)(3x + 2y + 2z) &= (2)(10)\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n-6x - 9y + 3z &= -21 \\\\\n6x + 4y + 4z &= 20\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNow, we can add these two equations to eliminate x:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n(-9y + 3z) + (4y + 4z) &= -21 + 20 \\\\\n-5y + 7z &= -1\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n-8y + 7z &= 14 \\\\\n-5y + 7z &= -1\n\\end{aligned}\n\nWe can multiply the second equation by -1 to make it easier to eliminate y:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n-8y + 7z &= 14 \\\\\n5y - 7z &= 1\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNow, we can add these two equations to eliminate z:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n(-8y + 7z) + (5y - 7z) &= 14 + 1 \\\\\n-3y &= 15\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\ny &= -\\frac{15}{3} \\\\\ny &= -5\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the equations with y and z. Let's use the equation -5y + 7z = -1:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n-5(-5) + 7z &= -1 \\\\\n25 + 7z &= -1 \\\\\n7z &= -26 \\\\\nz &= -\\frac{26}{7}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNow that we have the values of y and z, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find the value of x. Let's use the first equation 2x + 3y - z = 7:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n2x + 3(-5) - (-\\frac{26}{7}) &= 7 \\\\\n2x - 15 + \\frac{26}{7} &= 7 \\\\\n2x &= 7 + 15 - \\frac{26}{7} \\\\\n2x &= \\frac{49}{7} \\\\\nx &= \\frac{49}{14}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z are:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nx &= \\frac{49}{14} \\\\\ny &= -5 \\\\\nz &= -\\frac{26}{7}\n\\end{aligned}"
