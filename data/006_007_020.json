    "message_2": "To calculate the expected value of the stock price change, we need to multiply the probability of each outcome by the value of that outcome and then sum the results.\n\nExpected value = (probability of increase * value of increase) + (probability of decrease * value of decrease)\n\nExpected value = (0.4 * $5) + (0.6 * -$2)\n\nExpected value = ($2) + (-$1.2)\n\nExpected value = $0.8\n\nThe expected value of the stock price change is $0.8."
