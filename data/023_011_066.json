    "message_1": "Here's a question for a math student to solve related to Fourier analysis:\n\nA voltage signal in a certain electronic device is represented mathematically as f(t) = 2sin(4000πt) + 3cos(8000πt). Use the Fourier transform to determine the frequency content of the signal and find the frequencies and amplitude of each component.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency content of the given signal, we will first identify the individual sinusoidal components in the signal. The given signal is:\n\nf(t) = 2sin(4000πt) + 3cos(8000πt)\n\nWe can see that there are two sinusoidal components in the signal:\n\n1. A sine wave with amplitude 2 and angular frequency 4000π rad/s\n2. A cosine wave with amplitude 3 and angular frequency 8000π rad/s\n\nNow, we can convert the angular frequencies to regular frequencies:\n\n1. For the sine wave component:\nω1 = 4000π rad/s\nTo convert this to frequency, we use the formula: ω = 2πf\nf1 = ω1 / (2π) = 4000π / (2π) = 2000 Hz\n\n2. For the cosine wave component:\nω2 = 8000π rad/s\nTo convert this to frequency, we use the formula: ω = 2πf\nf2 = ω2 / (2π) = 8000π / (2π) = 4000 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal consists of two components:\n\n1. A sine wave with amplitude 2 and frequency 2000 Hz\n2. A cosine wave with amplitude 3 and frequency 4000 Hz"
