    "message_1": "A flagpole is standing on level ground. If the angle of elevation from a point on the ground to the top of the flagpole is 40 degrees, and the distance between the point on the ground and the foot of the flagpole is 50 meters, what is the height of the flagpole? Round your answer to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 40 degrees, the distance between the point on the ground and the foot of the flagpole (adjacent side) is 50 meters, and the height of the flagpole (opposite side) is what we want to find.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(40°) = height / 50\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 50:\n\nheight = 50 * tan(40°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 40 degrees and multiply it by 50:\n\nheight ≈ 50 * 0.8391\nheight ≈ 41.955\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the flagpole is approximately 42 meters."
