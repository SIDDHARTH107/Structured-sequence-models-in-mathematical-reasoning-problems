    "message_2": "Let's label the triangle with points A, B, and C, where angle A is the 30-degree angle, side BC is the 5 cm leg, and side AC is the hypotenuse.\n\nTo find the length of the hypotenuse (AC), we can use the sine function:\n\nsin(angle A) = opposite side (BC) / hypotenuse (AC)\n\nsin(30°) = 5 cm / AC\n\nSince sin(30°) = 1/2, we can write:\n\n1/2 = 5 cm / AC\n\nNow, we can solve for AC:\n\nAC = 5 cm / (1/2) = 5 cm * 2 = 10 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse (AC) is 10 cm.\n\nNext, we need to find the length of the other leg (AB). We can use the cosine function for this:\n\ncos(angle A) = adjacent side (AB) / hypotenuse (AC)\n\ncos(30°) = AB / 10 cm\n\nSince cos(30°) = √3/2, we can write:\n\n√3/2 = AB / 10 cm\n\nNow, we can solve for AB:\n\nAB = 10 cm * (√3/2) = 5√3 cm\n\nSo, the length of the other leg (AB) is 5√3 cm.\n\nFinally, we can find the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = AB + BC + AC = 5√3 cm + 5 cm + 10 cm = 5√3 cm + 15 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 5√3 cm + 15 cm."
