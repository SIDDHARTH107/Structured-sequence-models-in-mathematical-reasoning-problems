    "message_2": "To determine the genus of K7, we will use the formula for the genus of a graph:\n\ngenus(G) = (m - n + 1 + 2r) / 6\n\nwhere G is the graph, m is the number of edges, n is the number of vertices, and r is the number of regions in the graph.\n\nFor K7, the number of vertices (n) is 7. The number of edges (m) in a complete graph can be calculated using the formula:\n\nm = n(n - 1) / 2\n\nSo for K7, we have:\n\nm = 7(7 - 1) / 2 = 7(6) / 2 = 21\n\nNow we need to find the number of regions (r) in the graph. For a complete graph, the number of regions can be calculated using the formula:\n\nr = 2^(n - 1) - n - 1\n\nFor K7, we have:\n\nr = 2^(7 - 1) - 7 - 1 = 2^6 - 8 = 64 - 8 = 56\n\nNow we can plug these values into the genus formula:\n\ngenus(K7) = (21 - 7 + 1 + 2(56)) / 6 = (14 + 112) / 6 = 126 / 6 = 21\n\nTherefore, the genus of K7 is 21."
