    "message_1": "A network has 4 nodes and 5 edges, each with a capacity of 3. The maximum flow that can be sent from node 1 to node 4 is what?",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum flow that can be sent from node 1 to node 4, we need to find the maximum flow through the network. Since there are 5 edges with a capacity of 3 each, the total capacity of the network is 5 * 3 = 15. However, the maximum flow is determined by the bottleneck in the network, which is the path with the least capacity.\n\nLet's consider the possible paths from node 1 to node 4:\n\n1. Path 1-2-4: This path has a capacity of 3 (minimum capacity of the edges in the path).\n2. Path 1-3-4: This path also has a capacity of 3.\n\nSince there are only two paths from node 1 to node 4, and both have a capacity of 3, the maximum flow that can be sent from node 1 to node 4 is 3."
