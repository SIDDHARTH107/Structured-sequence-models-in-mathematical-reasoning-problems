    "message_1": "What is the probability that in a certain country's parliamentary election, a specific political party will win exactly 15 out of 50 available seats, given that the party has a 35% chance of winning in any individual seat?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of the specific party winning exactly k seats\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k seats out of n (in this case, 50)\n- n is the total number of seats (50 in this case)\n- k is the number of seats the specific party wins (15 in this case)\n- p is the probability of winning a single seat (35% or 0.35 in this case)\n- (1-p) is the probability of not winning a single seat (65% or 0.65 in this case)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(50, 15), which is the number of ways to choose 15 seats out of 50:\n\nC(50, 15) = 50! / (15! * (50-15)!)\nC(50, 15) = 50! / (15! * 35!)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 15) = C(50, 15) * 0.35^15 * 0.65^35\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nC(50, 15) ≈ 2,118,760\n0.35^15 ≈ 0.000006\n0.65^35 ≈ 0.0003\n\nNow, multiply these values together:\n\nP(X = 15) ≈ 2,118,760 * 0.000006 * 0.0003\nP(X = 15) ≈ 0.0038\n\nSo, the probability that the specific political party will win exactly 15 out of 50 available seats is approximately 0.0038 or 0.38%."
