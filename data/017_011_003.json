    "message_2": "To find all possible isomorphisms for a group of order 12, we first need to determine the possible group structures. A group of order 12 can be written as a product of its prime factors: 12 = 2^2 * 3. Using the Sylow theorems, we can determine the possible structures for groups of order 12.\n\n1. Cyclic group: Z_12\nThis is the group of integers modulo 12 under addition. It has one element of order 1, four elements of order 2, two elements of order 3, and four elements of order 6.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: Z_4 x Z_3\nThis group has one element of order 1, two elements of order 2, two elements of order 3, and four elements of order 6.\n\n3. Semidirect product of Z_4 and Z_3: Z_4 ⋊ Z_3\nThis group has one element of order 1, two elements of order 2, two elements of order 3, and four elements of order 6. It is non-abelian.\n\n4. Alternating group: A_4\nThis is the group of even permutations of 4 elements. It has one element of order 1, three elements of order 2, and eight elements of order 3.\n\nNow, let's find the isomorphisms between these groups:\n\n1. Z_12 is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_3.\nThese groups have the same number of elements of each order, and they are both abelian. An isomorphism can be defined as φ: Z_12 → Z_4 x Z_3, where φ(x) = (x mod 4, x mod 3).\n\n2. Z_4 ⋊ Z_3 is not isomorphic to any other group of order 12.\nThis group is non-abelian, so it cannot be isomorphic to the abelian groups Z_12 or Z_4 x Z_3. It also has a different number of elements of order 2 and 3 compared to A_4, so it cannot be isomorphic to A_4.\n\n3. A_4 is not isomorphic to any other group of order 12.\nAs mentioned earlier, A_4 has a different number of elements of order 2 and 3 compared to the other groups, so it cannot be isomorphic to any of them.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one isomorphism between groups of order 12: Z_12 is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_3."
