    "message_2": "To maximize the area of a rectangular garden with a fixed perimeter, the garden should be a square. This is because, for a given perimeter, a square has the largest area among all rectangles.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.\n\nIn this case, the perimeter is 60 meters, so:\n\n60 = 2l + 2w\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n30 = l + w\n\nSince the garden should be a square, l = w. Therefore, we can write the equation as:\n\n30 = l + l\n\nNow, we can solve for l:\n\n30 = 2l\nl = 15\n\nSince l = w, the width is also 15 meters.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular garden should be 15 meters by 15 meters to maximize its area."
