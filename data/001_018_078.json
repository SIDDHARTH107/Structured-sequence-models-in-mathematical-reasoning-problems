    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic expression, we first need to simplify each term:\n\nlog base 2 (32) can be written as 2^x = 32, where x is the exponent we're looking for. Since 2^5 = 32, we have x = 5. So, log base 2 (32) = 5.\n\nNext, we have 2log base 2 (8). First, we find log base 2 (8), which can be written as 2^y = 8. Since 2^3 = 8, we have y = 3. So, log base 2 (8) = 3. Now, we multiply this by 2: 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nNow, we can subtract the two terms: 5 - 6 = -1.\n\nSo, the solution to the logarithmic expression log base 2 (32) - 2log base 2 (8) is -1."
