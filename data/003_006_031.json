    "message_2": "To find the length of the unknown side (side c) using the Law of Cosines, not the Law of Sines, as we have two sides and an included angle. The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle, and C is the included angle between sides a and b.\n\nGiven the information, we have:\n\na = 6 cm\nb = 8 cm\nC = 60 degrees\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of side c:\n\nc² = (6)² + (8)² - 2 * 6 * 8 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 36 + 64 - 96 * (1/2)\nc² = 100 - 48\nc² = 52\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √52\nc ≈ 7.21 cm\n\nSo, the length of the unknown side (side c) is approximately 7.21 cm."
