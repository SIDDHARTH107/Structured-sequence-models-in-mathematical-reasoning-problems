    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, ϕ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. To find ϕ(20), we can use the formula:\n\nϕ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factors of 20: 20 = 2^2 * 5^1\n\nNow, we can plug these prime factors into the formula:\n\nϕ(20) = 20 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5)\nϕ(20) = 20 * (1/2) * (4/5)\nϕ(20) = 10 * 4\nϕ(20) = 40/2\nϕ(20) = 8\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function ϕ(20) is 8."
