    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. Top and bottom faces: length × width = 8 cm × 6 cm = 48 cm²\n2. Front and back faces: length × height = 8 cm × 4 cm = 32 cm²\n3. Left and right faces: width × height = 6 cm × 4 cm = 24 cm²\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together:\n\nSurface area = (2 × 48 cm²) + (2 × 32 cm²) + (2 × 24 cm²) = 96 cm² + 64 cm² + 48 cm² = 208 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 208 cm²."
