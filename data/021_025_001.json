The materials required and the cost per unit are listed below:\n\n| Material | Cost per unit |\n|----------|---------------|\n| A        | $5            |\n| B        | $3            |\n| C        | $6            |\n| D        | $2            |\n\nThe production of one unit of the product requires:\n\n- 2 units of material A\n- 3 units of material B\n- 1 unit of material C\n- 2 units of material D\n\nUsing the Whale Optimization Algorithm, find the minimum cost of producing one unit of the product.",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is typically used for solving complex optimization problems. However, in this case, the problem is relatively simple and can be solved directly without using the WOA.\n\nTo find the minimum cost of producing one unit of the product, we can simply multiply the required units of each material by their respective cost per unit and then sum the results.\n\nMinimum cost = (2 units of A * $5/unit) + (3 units of B * $3/unit) + (1 unit of C * $6/unit) + (2 units of D * $2/unit)\n\nMinimum cost = (2 * $5) + (3 * $3) + (1 * $6) + (2 * $2)\nMinimum cost = $10 + $9 + $6 + $4\nMinimum cost = $29\n\nSo, the minimum cost of producing one unit of the product is $29."
