    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. Each unit of A requires two hours of machine time and three hours of labor, whereas each unit of B requires three hours of machine time and two hours of labor. The company has a total of 24,000 hours of machine time and 18,000 hours of labor available for production. Each unit of A yields a profit of $50 and each unit of B yields a profit of $60. \nWhat is the optimal production mix that maximizes the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for machine time and labor are as follows:\n\nMachine time: 2x + 3y ≤ 24,000\nLabor: 3x + 2y ≤ 18,000\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 50x + 60y\n\nTo find the optimal production mix, we will first find the feasible region by solving the constraints.\n\n1) Solve the machine time constraint for y:\n\n3y ≤ 24,000 - 2x\ny ≤ (24,000 - 2x) / 3\n\n2) Solve the labor constraint for y:\n\n2y ≤ 18,000 - 3x\ny ≤ (18,000 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we will find the points of intersection of these constraints:\n\n(24,000 - 2x) / 3 = (18,000 - 3x) / 2\n\nCross-multiply and solve for x:\n\n48,000 - 4x = 54,000 - 9x\n5x = 6,000\nx = 1,200\n\nNow, find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny = (18,000 - 3(1,200)) / 2\ny = (18,000 - 3,600) / 2\ny = 14,400 / 2\ny = 7,200 / 1\ny = 7,200\n\nSo, the optimal production mix is 1,200 units of product A and 7,200 units of product B.\n\nTo find the maximum profit, plug these values into the profit function:\n\nProfit = 50(1,200) + 60(7,200)\nProfit = 60,000 + 432,000\nProfit = $492,000\n\nThe maximum profit the company can make is $492,000 with a production mix of 1,200 units of product A and 7,200 units of product B."
