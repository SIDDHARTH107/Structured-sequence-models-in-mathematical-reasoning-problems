    "message_1": "A pharmaceutical company claims that the average weight gain for people who took their weight gain supplement is more than 5 pounds per month. To test this claim, a statistician randomly selects 40 people who took the supplement and finds that their average weight gain is 6.2 pounds with a standard deviation of 2.3 pounds. \n\nUsing a significance level of 0.05, can you conclude that the weight gain supplement is effective in helping people gain more than 5 pounds per month?",
    "message_2": "To test the claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. We are given the following information:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 5 (average weight gain is 5 pounds per month)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ > 5 (average weight gain is more than 5 pounds per month)\n\nSample size (n) = 40\nSample mean (x̄) = 6.2 pounds\nSample standard deviation (s) = 2.3 pounds\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (6.2 - 5) / (2.3 / √40)\nt ≈ 3.49\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 39 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 40 - 1 = 39). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately 1.685.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (3.49) is greater than the critical t-value (1.685), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. \n\nTherefore, at a 0.05 significance level, we can conclude that the weight gain supplement is effective in helping people gain more than 5 pounds per month."
