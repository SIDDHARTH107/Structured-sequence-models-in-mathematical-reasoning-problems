    "message_2": "To find the probability of no burglaries occurring in the next 7 days, we need to find the probability of a burglary not occurring on each day and then multiply those probabilities together.\n\nThe probability of a burglary not occurring on any given day is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nNow we need to multiply the probability of a burglary not occurring on each of the 7 days:\n\n0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.95^7 â‰ˆ 0.6983\n\nSo, the probability of no burglaries occurring in the neighborhood during the next 7 days is approximately 0.6983 or 69.83%."
