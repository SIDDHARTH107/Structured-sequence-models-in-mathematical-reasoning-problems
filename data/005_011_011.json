    "message_1": "A company is testing two different types of fertilizers for their plants. The company has 25 plants of the same kind. They randomly select 13 plants and apply the first type of fertilizer, while the remaining 12 plants receive the second type of fertilizer. After a month, they measure the height of each plant in centimeters. The data collected are:\n\nType 1: 45, 63, 57, 51, 42, 48, 52, 60, 50, 47, 55, 58, 53\nType 2: 48, 51, 53, 46, 55, 50, 49, 54, 52, 57, 47, 50\n\nAt a significance level of 0.05, can you conclude that there is a significant difference in height between the two types of fertilizers?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in height between the two types of fertilizers, we will perform an independent two-sample t-test. First, we need to calculate the means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for each group.\n\nType 1:\nMean (M1) = (45+63+57+51+42+48+52+60+50+47+55+58+53)/13 = 53.23\nStandard Deviation (SD1) = 6.23 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\nSample Size (n1) = 13\n\nType 2:\nMean (M2) = (48+51+53+46+55+50+49+54+52+57+47+50)/12 = 51.08\nStandard Deviation (SD2) = 3.43 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\nSample Size (n2) = 12\n\nNow we can perform the t-test using the following formula:\n\nt = (M1 - M2) / sqrt((SD1^2/n1) + (SD2^2/n2))\n\nt = (53.23 - 51.08) / sqrt((6.23^2/13) + (3.43^2/12))\nt = 2.15 / sqrt((38.77/13) + (11.77/12))\nt = 2.15 / sqrt(2.98 + 0.98)\nt = 2.15 / sqrt(3.96)\nt = 2.15 / 1.99\nt â‰ˆ 1.08\n\nNow we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n1 + n2 - 2 = 13 + 12 - 2 = 23. Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately 2.069.\n\nSince our calculated t-value (1.08) is less than the critical t-value (2.069), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. At a significance level of 0.05, we cannot conclude that there is a significant difference in height between the two types of fertilizers."
