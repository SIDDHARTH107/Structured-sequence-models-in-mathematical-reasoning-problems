    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series for f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we need to find the coefficients an and bn.\n\nFirst, let's find an:\n\nan = (1/π) ∫[-π,π] x*cos(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x is an odd function and cos(nx) is an even function, their product x*cos(nx) is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval (like [-π, π]) is zero. Therefore, an = 0 for all n.\n\nNow, let's find bn:\n\nbn = (1/π) ∫[-π,π] x*sin(nx) dx\n\nWe can use integration by parts to solve this integral. Let u = x and dv = sin(nx) dx. Then, du = dx and v = -(1/n)cos(nx).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nbn = (1/π) [(-x(1/n)cos(nx))|(-π,π) - ∫[-π,π] -(1/n)cos(nx) dx]\n\nbn = (1/π) [(-π(1/n)cos(nπ) + (π(1/n)cos(-nπ)) + (1/n) ∫[-π,π] cos(nx) dx]\n\nSince cos(nx) is an even function, the integral of cos(nx) over the symmetric interval [-π, π] is zero.\n\nbn = (1/π) [(-π(1/n)cos(nπ) + (π(1/n)cos(-nπ))]\n\nbn = (1/π) [(-π(1/n)cos(nπ) + π(1/n)cos(nπ))]\n\nFor n even, cos(nπ) = 1, and for n odd, cos(nπ) = -1. Therefore, bn = 0 for n even, and bn = (2π/n) for n odd.\n\nNow we have the Fourier series for f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π]:\n\nf(x) = ∑ (n=1 to ∞) [ 0*cos(nx) + bn*sin(nx) ]\n\nf(x) = ∑ (n=1,3,5,...) [(2π/n) * sin(nx)]\n\nThe Fourier series converges to the function f(x) = x on the interval (-π, π) by the Dirichlet's theorem on the convergence of Fourier series, since f(x) = x is piecewise continuous and has a piecewise continuous derivative on the interval (-π, π). However, at the endpoints x = -π and x = π, the Fourier series converges to the average value of the function at these points, which is zero in this case."
