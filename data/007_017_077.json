    "message_2": "To find the sum of the first 10 pairs of twin primes, we first need to identify the twin prime pairs. Twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 2. The first 10 pairs of twin primes are:\n\n(3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41, 43), (59, 61), (71, 73), (101, 103), (107, 109)\n\nNow, we will sum up these pairs:\n\n3 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 29 + 31 + 41 + 43 + 59 + 61 + 71 + 73 + 101 + 103 + 107 + 109 = 843\n\nSo, the sum of the first 10 pairs of twin primes is 843."
