    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function $f(z)=\\frac{z^6}{\\sin(2z)\\cos^2(z)}$, we need to find the points where the denominator is equal to zero. The denominator is given by $\\sin(2z)\\cos^2(z)$.\n\nFirst, let's find the zeros of $\\sin(2z)$. We have:\n\n$\\sin(2z) = 0$\n\n$2z = k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer\n\n$z = \\frac{k\\pi}{2}$\n\nNow, let's find the zeros of $\\cos^2(z)$. We have:\n\n$\\cos^2(z) = 0$\n\n$\\cos(z) = 0$\n\n$z = \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2}$, where $k$ is an integer\n\nNow, we need to find the points where either $\\sin(2z)$ or $\\cos^2(z)$ is equal to zero. These points are given by:\n\n$z = \\frac{k\\pi}{2}$ and $z = \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2}$, where $k$ is an integer\n\nThese are the singularities of the function $f(z)$. Now, let's determine their types.\n\nSince $\\sin(2z)$ and $\\cos^2(z)$ are both analytic functions, their zeros are isolated. Therefore, the singularities of $f(z)$ are isolated singularities.\n\nTo determine the type of each isolated singularity, we can use the following definitions:\n\n1. A removable singularity is a point where the function can be redefined to be analytic.\n2. A pole is a point where the function goes to infinity.\n3. An essential singularity is a point where the function has no limit.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of $f(z)$ near each singularity:\n\n1. For $z = \\frac{k\\pi}{2}$:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{z^6}{\\sin(2z)\\cos^2(z)}$\n\nAs $z$ approaches $\\frac{k\\pi}{2}$, $\\sin(2z)$ goes to zero, while $\\cos^2(z)$ is nonzero. Therefore, the function goes to infinity, and this singularity is a pole.\n\n2. For $z = \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2}$:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{z^6}{\\sin(2z)\\cos^2(z)}$\n\nAs $z$ approaches $\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2}$, $\\cos^2(z)$ goes to zero, while $\\sin(2z)$ is nonzero. Therefore, the function goes to infinity, and this singularity is also a pole.\n\nIn conclusion, the singularities of the function $f(z)=\\frac{z^6}{\\sin(2z)\\cos^2(z)}$ are located at $z = \\frac{k\\pi}{2}$ and $z = \\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{2}$, where $k$ is an integer, and they are all poles."
