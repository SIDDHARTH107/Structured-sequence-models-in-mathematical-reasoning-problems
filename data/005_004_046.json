    "message_2": "To calculate the One-Way ANOVA F-statistic, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of each department.\n2. Calculate the overall mean.\n3. Calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB) and the Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW).\n4. Calculate the Mean Square Between Groups (MSB) and the Mean Square Within Groups (MSW).\n5. Calculate the F-statistic.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean of each department.\nDepartment 1: (50 + 60 + 70 + 55 + 65) / 5 = 60\nDepartment 2: (45 + 55 + 50 + 60 + 65) / 5 = 55\nDepartment 3: (70 + 75 + 80 + 82 + 68) / 5 = 75\n\nStep 2: Calculate the overall mean.\nOverall mean = (sum of all values) / (total number of values)\nOverall mean = (50 + 60 + 70 + 55 + 65 + 45 + 55 + 50 + 60 + 65 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 82 + 68) / 15 = 900 / 15 = 60\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB) and the Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW).\nSSB = Σ(n_i * (mean_i - overall_mean)^2)\nSSB = (5 * (60 - 60)^2) + (5 * (55 - 60)^2) + (5 * (75 - 60)^2)\nSSB = (5 * 0) + (5 * 25) + (5 * 225)\nSSB = 0 + 125 + 1125\nSSB = 1250\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(value_ij - mean_i)^2\nDepartment 1 SSW: (50-60)^2 + (60-60)^2 + (70-60)^2 + (55-60)^2 + (65-60)^2 = 100 + 0 + 100 + 25 + 25 = 250\nDepartment 2 SSW: (45-55)^2 + (55-55)^2 + (50-55)^2 + (60-55)^2 + (65-55)^2 = 100 + 0 + 25 + 25 + 100 = 250\nDepartment 3 SSW: (70-75)^2 + (75-75)^2 + (80-75)^2 + (82-75)^2 + (68-75)^2 = 25 + 0 + 25 + 49 + 49 = 148\nSSW = 250 + 250 + 148 = 648\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Mean Square Between Groups (MSB) and the Mean Square Within Groups (MSW).\nMSB = SSB / (number of groups - 1)\nMSB = 1250 / (3 - 1)\nMSB = 1250 / 2\nMSB = 625\n\nMSW = SSW / (total number of values - number of groups)\nMSW = 648 / (15 - 3)\nMSW = 648 / 12\nMSW = 54\n\nStep 5: Calculate the F-statistic.\nF-statistic = MSB / MSW\nF-statistic = 625 / 54\nF-statistic ≈ 11.57\n\nNow, we need to determine whether there is a significant difference in productivity levels of the three departments. To do this, we will compare the calculated F-statistic with the critical F-value from the F-distribution table. We will use a significance level of 0.05 (commonly used).\n\nDegrees of freedom between groups (df1) = number of groups - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\nDegrees of freedom within groups (df2) = total number of values - number of groups = 15 - 3 = 12\n\nLooking up the F-distribution table for df1 = 2 and df2 = 12 at a 0.05 significance level, we find the critical F-value to be approximately 3.89.\n\nSince our calculated F-statistic (11.57) is greater than the critical F-value (3.89), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in productivity levels of the three departments."
