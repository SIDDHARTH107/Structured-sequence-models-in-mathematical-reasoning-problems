    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the length of each side of the triangle is multiplied by 4/3. \n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of each side is 1 * (4/3) = 4/3 units.\nAfter the second iteration, the length of each side is (4/3) * (4/3) = 16/9 units.\nAfter the third iteration, the length of each side is (16/9) * (4/3) = 64/27 units.\nAfter the fourth iteration, the length of each side is (64/27) * (4/3) = 256/81 units.\n\nSince the Koch island is an equilateral triangle, the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all three sides. Therefore, the perimeter after the 4th iteration is:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * (256/81) = 768/81 units."
