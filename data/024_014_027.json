    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of the vector field $V$ with respect to the vector field $W$, we use the Lie bracket $[W, V]$. The Lie bracket is defined as $[W, V] = WV - VW$, where $WV$ and $VW$ denote the action of the vector fields on each other.\n\nRecall that the action of a vector field on another vector field is given by the directional derivative. In coordinates, this is given by the following formula:\n\n$WV = W^i \\frac{\\partial V^j}{\\partial x^i} \\partial_j - V^i \\frac{\\partial W^j}{\\partial x^i} \\partial_j$\n\nIn our case, the components of the vector fields are:\n\n$V^i = (0, x, y, z)$ and $W^i = (0, 2x, 2y, 2z)$\n\nNow, we compute the action of $W$ on $V$:\n\n$WV = 2x \\frac{\\partial (x)}{\\partial y} \\partial_y + 2x \\frac{\\partial (y)}{\\partial z} \\partial_z + 2x \\frac{\\partial (z)}{\\partial x} \\partial_x + 2y \\frac{\\partial (x)}{\\partial z} \\partial_y + 2y \\frac{\\partial (y)}{\\partial x} \\partial_z + 2y \\frac{\\partial (z)}{\\partial y} \\partial_x + 2z \\frac{\\partial (x)}{\\partial x} \\partial_y + 2z \\frac{\\partial (y)}{\\partial y} \\partial_z + 2z \\frac{\\partial (z)}{\\partial z} \\partial_x$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$WV = 2z \\partial_y + 2x \\partial_z + 2y \\partial_x$\n\nNow, we compute the action of $V$ on $W$:\n\n$VW = x \\frac{\\partial (2x)}{\\partial y} \\partial_y + x \\frac{\\partial (2y)}{\\partial z} \\partial_z + x \\frac{\\partial (2z)}{\\partial x} \\partial_x + y \\frac{\\partial (2x)}{\\partial z} \\partial_y + y \\frac{\\partial (2y)}{\\partial x} \\partial_z + y \\frac{\\partial (2z)}{\\partial y} \\partial_x + z \\frac{\\partial (2x)}{\\partial x} \\partial_y + z \\frac{\\partial (2y)}{\\partial y} \\partial_z + z \\frac{\\partial (2z)}{\\partial z} \\partial_x$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$VW = z \\partial_y + x \\partial_z + y \\partial_x$\n\nFinally, we compute the Lie bracket $[W, V] = WV - VW$:\n\n$[W, V] = (2z - z) \\partial_y + (2x - x) \\partial_z + (2y - y) \\partial_x = z \\partial_y + x \\partial_z + y \\partial_x$\n\nThus, the Lie derivative of $V$ with respect to $W$ is the vector field $[W, V] = z \\partial_y + x \\partial_z + y \\partial_x$."
