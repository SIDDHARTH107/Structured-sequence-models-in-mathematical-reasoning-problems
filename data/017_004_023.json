    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 25, by the Sylow Theorems, there exists a Sylow 5-subgroup of G, say H. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G is given by n_5, which satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides the index of H in G, which is [G : H] = 25/5 = 5.\n\nThe only possibility for n_5 that satisfies both conditions is n_5 = 1. Thus, there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup H of G, and it must be a normal subgroup since it is unique.\n\nNow, let's consider the order of H. Since H is a Sylow 5-subgroup, its order must be a power of 5. The only possibilities are 1, 5, and 25. If the order of H is 1, then G is trivial, which is not the case. If the order of H is 25, then G is cyclic, as H is a cyclic group of order 25.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when the order of H is 5. Since H is normal in G, we can form the quotient group G/H. The order of G/H is |G|/|H| = 25/5 = 5, which is prime. Therefore, G/H is a cyclic group. Let K be a subgroup of G such that the quotient group G/H is isomorphic to K. Then, K is a cyclic group of order 5.\n\nNow, we have two cyclic subgroups H and K of G, both of order 5. Since |H| and |K| are coprime, we have |H ∩ K| = 1, which means H ∩ K is the trivial subgroup. The product of the orders of H and K is |H||K| = 5 * 5 = 25, which is equal to the order of G. By the product formula, we have:\n\n|HK| = |H||K| / |H ∩ K| = 25 / 1 = 25.\n\nThus, G = HK, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, both of which are cyclic groups of order 5. In conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
