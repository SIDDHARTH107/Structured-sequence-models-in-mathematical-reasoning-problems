    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), which represent the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty groups. In this case, we have n = 7 objects and k = 4 groups.\n\nThe Stirling number of the second kind can be found using the following formula:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can use this formula to find S(7, 4) by first calculating the necessary Stirling numbers for smaller values of n and k:\n\nS(1, 1) = 1\nS(2, 1) = 1\nS(2, 2) = 1\nS(3, 1) = 1\nS(3, 2) = 3\nS(3, 3) = 1\nS(4, 1) = 1\nS(4, 2) = 7\nS(4, 3) = 6\nS(4, 4) = 1\nS(5, 1) = 1\nS(5, 2) = 15\nS(5, 3) = 25\nS(5, 4) = 10\nS(5, 5) = 1\nS(6, 1) = 1\nS(6, 2) = 31\nS(6, 3) = 90\nS(6, 4) = 65\nS(6, 5) = 15\nS(6, 6) = 1\n\nNow we can find S(7, 4) using the formula:\n\nS(7, 4) = 4 * S(6, 4) + S(6, 3)\nS(7, 4) = 4 * 65 + 90\nS(7, 4) = 260 + 90\nS(7, 4) = 350\n\nSo there are 350 ways to divide a set of 7 objects into 4 non-empty groups using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
