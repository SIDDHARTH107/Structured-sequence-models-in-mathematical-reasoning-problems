    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape that is created by recursively removing cubes from the original cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nFor a Menger sponge of order 3, this process is repeated three times. To find the volume of the Menger sponge, we can calculate the total volume of the removed cubes and subtract it from the original cube's volume.\n\nOriginal cube volume: V = 27cm * 27cm * 27cm = 19683 cubic cm\n\nFirst iteration:\n- Number of removed cubes: 7 (6 from faces + 1 from center)\n- Side length of each removed cube: 27cm / 3 = 9cm\n- Total volume removed: 7 * (9cm)^3 = 5103 cubic cm\n\nSecond iteration:\n- Number of removed cubes: 7 * 20 (7 cubes removed in the first iteration, each with 20 remaining smaller cubes)\n- Side length of each removed cube: 9cm / 3 = 3cm\n- Total volume removed: 7 * 20 * (3cm)^3 = 3780 cubic cm\n\nThird iteration:\n- Number of removed cubes: 7 * 20 * 20 (7 * 20 cubes removed in the second iteration, each with 20 remaining smaller cubes)\n- Side length of each removed cube: 3cm / 3 = 1cm\n- Total volume removed: 7 * 20 * 20 * (1cm)^3 = 2800 cubic cm\n\nTotal volume removed after 3 iterations: 5103 + 3780 + 2800 = 11683 cubic cm\n\nVolume of Menger sponge of order 3: Original cube volume - Total volume removed = 19683 - 11683 = 8000 cubic cm"
