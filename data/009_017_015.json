    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field intensity at a distance of 4 cm from the wire, we can use Ampere's law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's law states that the closed line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (μ₀) times the total current (I) enclosed by the loop.\n\nMathematically, it is represented as:\n\n∮ B ⋅ dl = μ₀I\n\nFor a long straight wire, the magnetic field is in the form of concentric circles around the wire. So, we can choose a circular loop of radius r (4 cm) centered on the wire as our path for the line integral. The magnetic field (B) is tangent to the circle at every point, and the differential length element (dl) is also tangent to the circle. Therefore, B ⋅ dl = B dl.\n\nNow, we can rewrite Ampere's law as:\n\n∮ B dl = B ∮ dl = B(2πr) = μ₀I\n\nWe need to find the magnetic field intensity (B). To do this, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nB = μ₀I / (2πr)\n\nGiven values:\nI = 2 A (current)\nr = 4 cm = 0.04 m (distance from the wire)\nμ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A (permeability of free space)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A × 2 A) / (2π × 0.04 m)\n\nThe Amperes (A) cancel out, and we get:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm × 2) / (0.04 m)\n\nB ≈ 1 × 10^(-5) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field intensity at a distance of 4 cm from the wire is approximately 1 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
