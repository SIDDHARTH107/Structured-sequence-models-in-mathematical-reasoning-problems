Determine the Fourier transform of the current density function and use it to find the electric and magnetic fields at a point located 1.5 meters away from the wire. Assume that the wire is straight and lies on the x-axis.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the current density function. The sinusoidal current can be represented as:\n\nI(t) = I_0 * sin(2 * π * f * t)\n\nwhere I_0 = 5 A is the amplitude, f = 50 Hz is the frequency, and t is the time.\n\nThe current density function J(x, t) can be found by dividing the current I(t) by the cross-sectional area A of the wire. Assuming the wire has a uniform cross-sectional area, we have:\n\nJ(x, t) = I(t) / A\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of the current density function J(x, t). Since J(x, t) is a function of both space (x) and time (t), we need to perform a 2D Fourier transform. However, since the wire is straight and lies on the x-axis, we can simplify the problem by considering only the time-dependent Fourier transform:\n\nJ(ω) = ∫ J(x, t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nwhere ω = 2 * π * f is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nSubstituting the expression for J(x, t) and solving the integral, we get:\n\nJ(ω) = (I_0 / A) * ∫ sin(2 * π * f * t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nJ(ω) = (I_0 / A) * [π * (δ(ω - 2πf) - δ(ω + 2πf))]\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field B at a point located 1.5 meters away from the wire:\n\nB = μ_0 / (4 * π) * ∫ (J(ω) × dl) / |r|^2\n\nwhere μ_0 is the permeability of free space, dl is the differential length of the wire, and r is the distance from the wire to the point.\n\nSince the wire is straight and lies on the x-axis, the magnetic field will be in the z-direction. Therefore, we can simplify the Biot-Savart law as:\n\nB_z = μ_0 / (4 * π) * ∫ (J(ω) * dl) / |r|^2\n\nSubstituting the expression for J(ω) and solving the integral, we get:\n\nB_z = (μ_0 * I_0) / (4 * π * A * |r|^2) * [π * (δ(ω - 2πf) - δ(ω + 2πf))]\n\nNow, we can use Ampere's law to find the electric field E at the same point:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * π * ε_0 * |r|)) * ∫ J(ω) dl\n\nwhere ε_0 is the permittivity of free space.\n\nSubstituting the expression for J(ω) and solving the integral, we get:\n\nE = (I_0 / (2 * π * ε_0 * A * |r|^2)) * [π * (δ(ω - 2πf) - δ(ω + 2πf))]\n\nFinally, we can plug in the values for the given problem:\n\nI_0 = 5 A, f = 50 Hz, |r| = 1.5 m\n\nμ_0 = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A, ε_0 = 8.854 × 10^(-12) C²/Nm²\n\nCalculating the magnetic field B_z and electric field E, we get:\n\nB_z = (4π × 10^(-7) * 5) / (4 * π * A * (1.5)^2) * [π * (δ(ω - 2π(50)) - δ(ω + 2π(50)))]\n\nE = (5 / (2 * π * 8.854 × 10^(-12) * A * (1.5)^2)) * [π * (δ(ω - 2π(50)) - δ(ω + 2π(50)))]\n\nNote that the results are still dependent on the cross-sectional area A of the wire, which was not provided in the problem statement."
