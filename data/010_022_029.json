    "message_2": "To find the surface area of the cube, we first need to find the length of one side of the cube. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of one side of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Side length of the cube = 24 cm\n\nThe surface area of a cube is given by the formula:\n\nSurface area = 6 × (side length)^2\n\nSubstituting the side length:\n\nSurface area = 6 × (24 cm)^2\nSurface area = 6 × 576 cm^2\nSurface area = 3456 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 3456 square centimeters."
