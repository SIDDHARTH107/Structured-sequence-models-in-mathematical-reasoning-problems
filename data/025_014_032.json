    "message_1": "Let $C$ be a smooth plane quartic curve given by the equation $y^2z^2=(x^2+z^2)(x^2+3z^2)$. Consider the complete linear system $|\\mathcal{O}_C(2,1)|$, where $\\mathcal{O}_C(d)$ denotes the line bundle of degree $d$ on $C$. Compute the dimension of this linear system i.e., find the number of linearly independent degree-3 polynomials that vanish on $C$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the complete linear system $|\\mathcal{O}_C(2,1)|$, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor $D$ on a curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$,\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the linear system $|D|$, $K_C$ is the canonical divisor of $C$, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nIn our case, we are given the divisor $D = (2,1)$. Since $C$ is a smooth plane quartic curve, it has genus $g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3$. The canonical divisor of a plane curve of degree $d$ is given by $K_C = (d-3)H$, where $H$ is the class of a hyperplane section. In our case, $K_C = (4-3)H = H$. Thus, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the degree of $D$ and $K_C - D$. The degree of a divisor is the intersection number with the class of a hyperplane section. In our case, the degree of $D$ is given by:\n\n$\\deg(D) = D \\cdot H = (2,1) \\cdot H = 2H^2 + H = 2(4) + 1 = 9$.\n\nSimilarly, the degree of $K_C - D$ is given by:\n\n$\\deg(K_C - D) = (K_C - D) \\cdot H = (H - (2,1)) \\cdot H = (H - 2H^2 - H) \\cdot H = -2(4) - 1 = -9$.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$l(D) - l(K_C - D) = 9 + 1 - 3 = 7$.\n\nSince $l(K_C - D) \\geq 0$, we have $l(D) \\geq 7$. Therefore, the dimension of the complete linear system $|\\mathcal{O}_C(2,1)|$ is at least 7, which means there are at least 7 linearly independent degree-3 polynomials that vanish on $C$."
