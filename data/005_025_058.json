    "message_1": "An electronics company claims that the average lifespan of its batteries is 500 hours. A sample of 50 batteries was tested and their average lifespan was found to be 480 hours with a standard deviation of 50 hours. Is there enough evidence to reject the company’s claim at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is enough evidence to reject the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average lifespan of the batteries is 500 hours, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average lifespan is not 500 hours.\n\nGiven data:\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 480 hours\nPopulation mean (μ) = 500 hours\nSample standard deviation (s) = 50 hours\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (480 - 500) / (50 / √50)\nt = -20 / (50 / √50)\nt ≈ -2.83\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49). Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\n\nt_critical ≈ ± 2.01\n\nSince the calculated t-score (-2.83) is less than the critical t-value (-2.01), we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence at a 0.05 significance level to reject the company's claim that the average lifespan of its batteries is 500 hours."
