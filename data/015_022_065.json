    "message_1": "Consider the following Mackey-Glass equation \n\ndx(t)/dt = 0.2x(t - τ) / [1 + x(t - τ)^10] - 0.1x(t)\n\nwhere τ = 17, x(0) = 1.2.\n\nWhat is the equilibrium point of the system?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium point of the system, we need to set dx(t)/dt = 0 and solve for x(t). \n\n0 = 0.2x(t - τ) / [1 + x(t - τ)^10] - 0.1x(t)\n\nLet x_eq denote the equilibrium point. Since the system is at equilibrium, x(t) = x(t - τ) = x_eq. Substituting x_eq into the equation:\n\n0 = 0.2x_eq / [1 + x_eq^10] - 0.1x_eq\n\nNow, we need to solve for x_eq:\n\n0.1x_eq = 0.2x_eq / [1 + x_eq^10]\n\n1 + x_eq^10 = 2\n\nx_eq^10 = 1\n\nx_eq = 1^(1/10)\n\nx_eq = 1\n\nSo, the equilibrium point of the system is x_eq = 1."
