    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA company produces two types of products, A and B. Each unit of product A requires 5 hours of machine time and 3 hours of labor time to manufacture, while each unit of product B requires 3 hours of machine time and 5 hours of labor time. The company has 60 hours of machine time and 60 hours of labor time available per week. Product A has a profit of $10 per unit and product B has a profit of $12 per unit. Using simulated annealing method, find the optimal quantities of product A and product B to maximize the company's profit.\n\nNote: You may assume that the company can produce a non-negative fraction of each product.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the simulated annealing method, we need to define the objective function, the constraints, and the cooling schedule. The objective function is the profit function, which we want to maximize:\n\nProfit = 10 * A + 12 * B\n\nConstraints:\n5A + 3B ≤ 60 (machine time constraint)\n3A + 5B ≤ 60 (labor time constraint)\nA ≥ 0, B ≥ 0 (non-negative production quantities)\n\nNow, let's implement the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the temperature T and the initial solution (A0, B0).\n2. Generate a random neighboring solution (A1, B1) by perturbing the current solution (A0, B0).\n3. Calculate the change in profit ΔP = Profit(A1, B1) - Profit(A0, B0).\n4. If ΔP > 0, accept the new solution (A1, B1). If ΔP < 0, accept the new solution with probability exp(ΔP/T).\n5. Update the temperature T according to the cooling schedule.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a minimum temperature is reached).\n\nAfter running the simulated annealing algorithm, we will obtain an optimal or near-optimal solution for the production quantities of products A and B that maximize the company's profit while satisfying the constraints.\n\nPlease note that the simulated annealing method is a heuristic optimization algorithm, and the solution may vary depending on the initial solution, cooling schedule, and other parameters. For this specific problem, it might be more efficient to use linear programming techniques to find the exact optimal solution."
