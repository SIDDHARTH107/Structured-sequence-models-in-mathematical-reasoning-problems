    "message_2": "To find the conformal map from the unit disk to the upper half-plane that sends the origin to 0 and the point i to infinity, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. First, we need to map the unit disk to the right half-plane. We can use the Möbius transformation for this purpose. The Möbius transformation is given by:\n\n   f(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d)\n\n   where a, b, c, and d are complex numbers.\n\n2. We want to map the origin (0) to 0 and the point i to infinity. To satisfy these conditions, we can set b = 0 and c = 1. Now, we have:\n\n   f(z) = az / (z + d)\n\n3. To map the point -1 to 1, we can set a = 1 and d = -1. Now, we have:\n\n   f(z) = z / (z - 1)\n\n   This is the conformal map from the unit disk to the right half-plane.\n\n4. Now, we need to map the right half-plane to the upper half-plane. We can use the exponential function for this purpose:\n\n   g(z) = e^(iπz)\n\n5. The final conformal map is the composition of f(z) and g(z):\n\n   h(z) = g(f(z)) = e^(iπ(z / (z - 1)))\n\nNow, let's find the image of the boundary of the unit disk under this map. The boundary of the unit disk is given by the circle |z| = 1. We can parameterize this circle using the angle θ as follows:\n\n   z = e^(iθ), 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π\n\nNow, we can find the image of the boundary under the conformal map h(z):\n\n   h(e^(iθ)) = e^(iπ(e^(iθ) / (e^(iθ) - 1)))\n\nTo find the image of the boundary, we can analyze the behavior of h(z) as θ varies from 0 to 2π. As θ goes from 0 to π, the argument of the exponential function in h(z) goes from 0 to π, and the imaginary part of h(z) goes from 0 to infinity. As θ goes from π to 2π, the argument of the exponential function in h(z) goes from π to 0, and the imaginary part of h(z) goes from infinity back to 0.\n\nThus, the image of the boundary of the unit disk under the conformal map h(z) is the positive real axis, which is the boundary of the upper half-plane."
