    "message_1": "A farmer has 100 meters of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular vegetable garden. What is the maximum area that the farmer can enclose?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the rectangle be L meters and the width be W meters. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\nP = 2L + 2W\n\nSince the farmer has 100 meters of fencing, we have:\n\n100 = 2L + 2W\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n50 = L + W\n\nNow, we want to maximize the area A of the rectangle, which is given by the formula:\n\nA = L * W\n\nWe can express W in terms of L using the perimeter equation:\n\nW = 50 - L\n\nNow substitute this expression for W in the area equation:\n\nA = L * (50 - L)\n\nA = 50L - L^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to L and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dL = 50 - 2L = 0\n\nSolve for L:\n\n2L = 50\nL = 25\n\nNow substitute this value of L back into the equation for W:\n\nW = 50 - 25 = 25\n\nSo, the maximum area is achieved when the length and width are both 25 meters. The maximum area is:\n\nA = 25 * 25 = 625 square meters"
