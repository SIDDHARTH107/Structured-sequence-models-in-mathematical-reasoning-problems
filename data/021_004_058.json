    "message_2": "First, let's find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1. \n\nf'(x) = 2x - 2\n\nNow, let's use the forward difference method to approximate f'(1). We'll need a small step size, h. Let's use h = 0.01.\n\nf'(1) ≈ (f(1 + h) - f(1)) / h\nf'(1) ≈ (f(1.01) - f(1)) / 0.01\n\nNow, let's find f(1.01) and f(1).\n\nf(1.01) = (1.01)^2 - 2(1.01) + 1 = 0.0001\nf(1) = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 1 = 0\n\nNow, plug these values back into the forward difference approximation:\n\nf'(1) ≈ (0.0001 - 0) / 0.01 = 0.01\n\nNow, let's use the trapezoidal rule with n = 4 to approximate the integral of f(x) from 0 to 2.\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ (Δx / 2) * (f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + f(x3))\n\nΔx = (2 - 0) / 4 = 0.5\n\nx0 = 0, x1 = 0.5, x2 = 1, x3 = 1.5, x4 = 2\n\nNow, let's find the function values at these points:\n\nf(x0) = f(0) = 0^2 - 2(0) + 1 = 1\nf(x1) = f(0.5) = (0.5)^2 - 2(0.5) + 1 = 0.25\nf(x2) = f(1) = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 1 = 0\nf(x3) = f(1.5) = (1.5)^2 - 2(1.5) + 1 = 0.25\nf(x4) = f(2) = (2)^2 - 2(2) + 1 = 1\n\nNow, plug these values back into the trapezoidal rule formula:\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ (0.5 / 2) * (1 + 2(0.25) + 2(0) + 1) = 0.5 * (1 + 0.5 + 0 + 1) = 0.5 * 2.5 = 1.25\n\nNow, let's estimate the error of the approximation. The error in the trapezoidal rule is given by the formula:\n\nError = -(b - a)^3 / (12n^2) * f''(c)\n\nwhere a and b are the limits of integration, n is the number of intervals, and f''(c) is the second derivative of the function evaluated at some point c in the interval [a, b].\n\nFirst, let's find the second derivative of f(x):\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince the second derivative is constant, we can use any value of c in the interval [0, 2]. Let's use c = 1:\n\nf''(1) = 2\n\nNow, plug these values into the error formula:\n\nError = -(2 - 0)^3 / (12 * 4^2) * 2 = -8 / 96 * 2 = -16 / 96 = -1/6\n\nThe error of the approximation is approximately -1/6. However, since we are only interested in the magnitude of the error, we can say that the error is approximately 1/6 or 0.1667.\n\nSo, using the forward difference method, we approximated f'(1) to be 0.01, and using the trapezoidal rule with n = 4, we approximated the integral of f(x) from 0 to 2 to be 1.25 with an estimated error of 0.1667."
