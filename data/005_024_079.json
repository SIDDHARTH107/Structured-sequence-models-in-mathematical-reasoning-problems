The data can be found in the following table:\n\nDay | Number of Products Sold\n----|-----------------------\n1   | 10\n2   | 13\n3   | 12\n4   | 11\n5   | 9\n6   | 15\n7   | 16\n8   | 12\n9   | 11\n10  | 14\n11  | 10\n12  | 12\n13  | 13\n14  | 14\n15  | 16\n16  | 18\n17  | 11\n18  | 9\n19  | 12\n20  | 13\n21  | 15\n22  | 14\n23  | 17\n24  | 16\n25  | 13\n26  | 12\n27  | 10\n28  | 11\n29  | 9\n30  | 13\n\nWhat is the mean and median number of products sold per day?",
    "message_2": "To find the mean, we need to sum up the number of products sold per day and divide by the total number of days (30).\n\nMean = (10 + 13 + 12 + 11 + 9 + 15 + 16 + 12 + 11 + 14 + 10 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 11 + 9 + 12 + 13 + 15 + 14 + 17 + 16 + 13 + 12 + 10 + 11 + 9 + 13) / 30\nMean = 366 / 30\nMean = 12.2\n\nTo find the median, we need to list the number of products sold per day in ascending order and find the middle value(s).\n\nSorted list: 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 14, 14, 15, 15, 16, 16, 16, 18\n\nSince there are 30 days, an even number, the median will be the average of the two middle values (12th and 13th values in the sorted list).\n\nMedian = (12 + 12) / 2\nMedian = 24 / 2\nMedian = 12\n\nSo, the mean number of products sold per day is 12.2, and the median number of products sold per day is 12."
