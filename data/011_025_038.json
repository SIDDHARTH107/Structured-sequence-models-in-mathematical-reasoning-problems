    "message_1": "In a game of Nim, there are two players and a heap of 15 stones. On each turn, a player removes between 1 and 4 stones from the heap, and the player who takes the last stone loses. If the first player starts by taking 2 stones, how many stones should the second player take on their turn in order to win the game?",
    "message_2": "To win the game of Nim, the second player should aim to leave a multiple of 5 stones (including the one that the first player will take) after each round of turns. This is because if there are 5 stones left, the first player will be forced to take the last stone and lose.\n\nSince the first player has taken 2 stones, there are now 13 stones left in the heap. In order to leave a multiple of 5 stones after the second player's turn, the second player should take 3 stones. This will leave 10 stones in the heap, which is a multiple of 5.\n\nBy doing this, the second player can ensure that they will always be able to leave a multiple of 5 stones after each round of turns, forcing the first player to take the last stone and lose the game."
