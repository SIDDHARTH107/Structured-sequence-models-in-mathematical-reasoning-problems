    "message_1": "Alice and Bob want to create a shared secret key. Alice chooses a prime number, p = 23, and a base, g = 5. She then chooses a secret number a = 6 and calculates A = g^a mod p. Bob chooses a secret number b = 15 and calculates B = g^b mod p. What is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use for their communication?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate A and B.\n\nA = g^a mod p = 5^6 mod 23\nA = 15625 mod 23\nA = 8\n\nB = g^b mod p = 5^15 mod 23\nB = 30517578125 mod 23\nB = 19\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can calculate the shared secret key using the following formulas:\n\nShared secret key (Alice's perspective) = B^a mod p = 19^6 mod 23\nShared secret key (Bob's perspective) = A^b mod p = 8^15 mod 23\n\nLet's calculate the shared secret key from both perspectives:\n\nShared secret key (Alice's perspective) = 19^6 mod 23 = 47045881 mod 23 = 2\n\nShared secret key (Bob's perspective) = 8^15 mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23 = 2\n\nAs we can see, the shared secret key calculated from both perspectives is the same, which is 2. Therefore, the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can use for their communication is 2."
