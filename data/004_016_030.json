    "message_1": "A student drove to his college at an average speed of 60 mph, and it took him 1.5 hours to complete the journey. Use the Mean Value Theorem to find the approximate speed limit the student must not exceed in order to avoid getting a speeding ticket on his way to college.",
    "message_2": "To use the Mean Value Theorem, we first need to find the total distance the student traveled. We can do this using the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nThe student's average speed was 60 mph, and the journey took 1.5 hours. So, the total distance traveled is:\n\nDistance = 60 mph × 1.5 hours = 90 miles\n\nNow, let's apply the Mean Value Theorem. The theorem states that there must be at least one point in the journey where the student's instantaneous speed is equal to the average speed. In this case, the average speed is 60 mph.\n\nSince the student's average speed was 60 mph, there must have been a point during the journey where the student was driving at exactly 60 mph. To avoid getting a speeding ticket, the student must not exceed this speed. Therefore, the approximate speed limit the student must not exceed is 60 mph."
