    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0 using the quadratic formula, we need to identify the coefficients a, b, and c. In this case, a = 2, b = 5, and c = -3.\n\nThe quadratic formula is given by:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nPlugging in the values of a, b, and c, we get:\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)² - 4(2)(-3))) / 2(2)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± √49) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± 7) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\n1) x = (-5 + 7) / 4\nx = 2 / 4\nx = 1/2\n\n2) x = (-5 - 7) / 4\nx = -12 / 4\nx = -3\n\nSo, the solutions to the quadratic equation 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0 are x = 1/2 and x = -3."
