    "message_2": "The Playfair cipher uses a 5x5 grid filled with 25 unique letters (excluding \"j\" in this case). To find the total number of possible keys, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the remaining 25 letters in the grid.\n\nThis is a permutation problem, as the order of the letters matters. The number of permutations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to be arranged, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 25 (the number of unique letters) and r = 25 (since we're arranging all of them in the grid). So the formula becomes:\n\nP(25, 25) = 25! / (25 - 25)!\n\nP(25, 25) = 25! / 0!\n\nSince 0! is defined as 1, the equation simplifies to:\n\nP(25, 25) = 25!\n\nNow, we just need to calculate the factorial of 25:\n\n25! = 25 × 24 × 23 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 ≈ 1.551121e+25\n\nSo there are approximately 1.55 x 10^25 (15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000) possible keys that can be used for the Playfair cipher with the given conditions."
