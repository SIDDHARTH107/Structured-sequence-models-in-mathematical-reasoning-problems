    "message_1": "A farmer has a piece of land that can be used to graze 100 cows optimally. The farmer shares the land with four other farmers. Each farmer has 20 cows. If the land is overgrazed, the grass won't grow back. According to the tragedy of the commons theory, if each farmer maximizes their own use of the land, it will lead to overgrazing and the depletion of the common resource. To avoid this, the group collectively decides to limit the total number of cows on the land to 120. How many cows should each farmer be allowed to graze to ensure the land is not overgrazed?",
    "message_2": "The optimal number of cows that can graze on the land without overgrazing is 100. Since there are 5 farmers sharing the land, the total number of cows should be divided equally among them to ensure the land is not overgrazed. \n\n100 cows / 5 farmers = 20 cows per farmer\n\nEach farmer should be allowed to graze 20 cows to ensure the land is not overgrazed."
