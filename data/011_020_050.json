    "message_1": "A company needs to deliver 8 packages to 8 different locations. If each package can be delivered to any of the 8 locations, how many different arrangements exist for the packages?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different arrangements for delivering the 8 packages to 8 different locations, we can use the concept of permutations. In this case, there are 8 packages and 8 locations, so there are 8! (8 factorial) possible arrangements.\n\n8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\n\nSo, there are 40,320 different arrangements for delivering the 8 packages to the 8 different locations."
