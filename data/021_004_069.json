    "message_2": "To calculate the derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4 at x = 2 using forward difference approximation with delta x = 0.1, we can use the formula:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + Δx) - f(x)) / Δx\n\nFirst, let's find f(2) and f(2.1):\n\nf(2) = (2)^2 + 3(2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6\nf(2.1) = (2.1)^2 + 3(2.1) - 4 = 4.41 + 6.3 - 4 = 6.71\n\nNow, we can use the forward difference approximation formula:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2.1) - f(2)) / 0.1 = (6.71 - 6) / 0.1 = 7.1\n\nNow, let's find the exact derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 3\n\nNow, let's find the exact value of the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nNow, we can calculate the error in the approximation:\n\nError = |Exact value - Approximate value| = |7 - 7.1| = 0.1\n\nSo, the forward difference approximation of the derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4 at x = 2 with delta x = 0.1 is 7.1, and the error in the approximation is 0.1."
