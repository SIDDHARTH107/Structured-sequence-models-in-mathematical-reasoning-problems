    "message_2": "To find the largest angle, we need to find the angle opposite the longest side, which is 15 cm in this case. We can use the Law of Cosines to find this angle. The Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c. In this case, a = 9 cm, b = 12 cm, and c = 15 cm. We want to find the angle C.\n\n15² = 9² + 12² - 2(9)(12) * cos(C)\n\n225 = 81 + 144 - 216 * cos(C)\n\nNow, we will solve for cos(C):\n\n225 - 81 - 144 = -216 * cos(C)\n\n0 = -216 * cos(C)\n\ncos(C) = 0\n\nNow, we will find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of cos(C):\n\nC = arccos(0)\n\nC = 90°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is 90°."
