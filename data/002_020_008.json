    "message_1": "A sector of a circle has a radius of 4cm and a central angle of 60 degrees. What is the perimeter of the sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle / 360) * 2 * π * radius\n\nIn this case, the central angle is 60 degrees and the radius is 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArc length = (60 / 360) * 2 * π * 4\nArc length = (1/6) * 2 * π * 4\nArc length = (1/3) * 8π\nArc length = 8π/3 cm\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we add the arc length to the two radii:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 * radius\nPerimeter = (8π/3) + 2 * 4\nPerimeter = (8π/3) + 8\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is (8π/3) + 8 cm."
