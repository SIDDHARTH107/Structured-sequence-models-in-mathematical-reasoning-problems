    "message_2": "To compute the Floer homology group of the torus T with coefficients in Z/2Z, we first need to understand the symplectic structure on T. The torus T can be viewed as a symplectic manifold with a symplectic form ω, which is a closed, non-degenerate 2-form. In the case of the torus, we can take ω to be the standard area form.\n\nNow, let's consider the Hamiltonian function H on T. For simplicity, we can take H to be a Morse function with non-degenerate critical points. The Floer homology group is then generated by the 1-periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian vector field X_H associated with H. In the case of the torus, the critical points of H correspond to the fixed points of X_H, and there are four of them: two minima, one saddle, and one maximum.\n\nThe Floer homology group is computed by considering the Floer complex, which is generated by the 1-periodic orbits of X_H, and taking the homology of the associated Floer chain complex. The Floer differential counts the number of gradient flow lines between the critical points modulo 2, since we are working with coefficients in Z/2Z.\n\nIn the case of the torus, the Floer differential is easy to compute. There are two gradient flow lines between each pair of critical points of index difference 1, so the Floer differential is zero modulo 2. Therefore, the Floer homology group is isomorphic to the Floer complex, which is generated by the four critical points of H.\n\nThus, the Floer homology group of the torus T with coefficients in Z/2Z is isomorphic to (Z/2Z)^4, generated by the four critical points of the Morse function H."
