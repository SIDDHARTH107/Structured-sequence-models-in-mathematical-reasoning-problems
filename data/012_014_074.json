If they are not isomorphic, provide a brief justification for your answer. If they are isomorphic, provide the corresponding isomorphism.",
    "message_2": "Graphs G and H are not isomorphic. \n\nJustification:\nAn isomorphism between two graphs is a bijection (one-to-one and onto correspondence) between the vertex sets of the graphs such that the edge sets are also preserved. In other words, two graphs are isomorphic if there is a way to relabel the vertices of one graph so that it becomes identical to the other graph.\n\nIn this case, the vertex degrees of the two graphs are different. Graph G has all vertices with degree 2, while graph H has two vertices with degree 1 and two vertices with degree 3. Since the vertex degrees are not preserved, there cannot be an isomorphism between these two graphs."
