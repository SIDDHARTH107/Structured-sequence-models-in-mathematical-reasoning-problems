    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the possible numbers of Sylow subgroups for each prime factor.\n3. Use the Sylow theorems to narrow down the possibilities.\n4. Determine the isomorphism types for each possibility.\n\nStep 1: Prime factorization\nThe order of the group is 120, which can be factored into primes as 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5.\n\nStep 2: Possible numbers of Sylow subgroups\nFor each prime factor, we need to determine the possible numbers of Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor p = 2, the Sylow 2-subgroups have order 2^3 = 8. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups must divide 120/8 = 15 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possibilities are 1 and 15.\n\nFor p = 3, the Sylow 3-subgroups have order 3. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups must divide 120/3 = 40 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possibilities are 1 and 10.\n\nFor p = 5, the Sylow 5-subgroups have order 5. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 120/5 = 24 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possibilities are 1 and 6.\n\nStep 3: Narrow down the possibilities\nUsing Sylow's theorems, we can narrow down the possibilities for the number of Sylow subgroups.\n\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it is also normal. If there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal as well. In this case, we have a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup. By the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, the group is a direct product of these subgroups, and we get a group of isomorphism type C_8 × C_3 × C_5, which is isomorphic to C_120.\n\nIf there are 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, then there must be a normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of a Sylow 2-subgroup and the direct product of the normal Sylow 3-subgroup and the normal Sylow 5-subgroup. There are four non-isomorphic groups of order 8 (C_8, C_4 × C_2, D_8, and Q_8), and for each of them, there are two possible actions on C_3 × C_5 (trivial and non-trivial). This gives 4 * 2 = 8 possibilities.\n\nStep 4: Determine the isomorphism types\nFor each of the 8 possibilities in the case with 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, we can determine the isomorphism type of the resulting group. Some of these groups will be isomorphic, so we need to identify the distinct isomorphism types.\n\nThe isomorphism types are:\n1. C_120\n2. C_2 × (C_4 × C_15)\n3. C_2 × D_30\n4. C_2 × (C_8 × C_3 × C_5)\n5. D_8 × C_3 × C_5\n6. Q_8 × C_3 × C_5\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
