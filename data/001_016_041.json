    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we first need to find the cube root of 27 and the cube root of 9 squared.\n\n$27^{1/3}$ is the cube root of 27, which is 3 because $3^3 = 27$.\n\n$9^{2/3}$ can be rewritten as $(9^{1/3})^2$. The cube root of 9 is 3 because $3^2 = 9$. So, $9^{1/3} = 3$. Now we square it: $(3)^2 = 9$.\n\nNow we can multiply the simplified expressions:\n\n$3 \\times 9 = 27$\n\nSo, $27^{1/3} \\times 9^{2/3} = 27$."
