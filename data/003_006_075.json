    "message_1": "A triangle has one angle measuring 30° and another angle measuring 60°. The length of the side opposite the 30° angle is 10 units and the length of the side opposite the 60° angle is 15 units. Find the length of the remaining side, opposite the remaining angle.",
    "message_2": "Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°, the remaining angle is 180° - 30° - 60° = 90°. This means we have a 30-60-90 right triangle.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the side lengths are in the ratio 1:√3:2. Since the side opposite the 30° angle is 10 units, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n1 / 10 = √3 / 15\n\nNow, we can find the length of the side opposite the 90° angle (the hypotenuse) by using the ratio:\n\n1 / 10 = 2 / x\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\nx = 20\n\nSo, the length of the remaining side, opposite the 90° angle, is 20 units."
