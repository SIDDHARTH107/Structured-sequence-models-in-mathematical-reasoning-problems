    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12. We will analyze the properties of G and compare them with the properties of C12, A4, and D6.\n\n1. Cyclic group C12: A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. In this case, C12 has an element of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, G has a subgroup of order 3 and a subgroup of order 4. If G has an element of order 12, then G is isomorphic to C12. However, if G does not have an element of order 12, we cannot conclude that G is not isomorphic to C12.\n\n2. Alternating group A4: The alternating group A4 consists of all even permutations of 4 elements. It has order 12 and is non-abelian. If G is abelian, then G cannot be isomorphic to A4. If G is non-abelian, we can further investigate its properties to see if it matches A4. A4 has three subgroups of order 4, which are all isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4. If G has three subgroups of order 4 with the same property, then G might be isomorphic to A4.\n\n3. Dihedral group D6: The dihedral group D6 consists of the symmetries of a regular hexagon, including rotations and reflections. It has order 12 and is non-abelian. D6 has one subgroup of order 6, which is cyclic and generated by a rotation. It also has six subgroups of order 2, generated by reflections. If G has a similar structure, then G might be isomorphic to D6.\n\nTo determine if G is isomorphic to any of these groups, we need to analyze its properties further. If G is abelian, it can only be isomorphic to C12. If G is non-abelian, we need to investigate its subgroups and their properties to see if they match either A4 or D6. Without more information about G, we cannot definitively determine which group it is isomorphic to."
