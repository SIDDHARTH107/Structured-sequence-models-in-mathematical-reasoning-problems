    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 13 cm and one leg of 5 cm. Find the length of the other leg.",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse, a and b are the lengths of the other two sides. We are given c = 13 cm and one leg a = 5 cm. We need to find the length of the other leg, b.\n\n13^2 = 5^2 + b^2\n169 = 25 + b^2\n144 = b^2\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides:\n\nb = âˆš144\nb = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 12 cm."
