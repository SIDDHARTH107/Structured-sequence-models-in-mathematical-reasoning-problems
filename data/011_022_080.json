    "message_1": "Here's a Knapsack problem:\nA person is going on a hike and can carry a backpack that can hold up to 10 pounds. They have 5 different items they want to bring with them:\n- Tent (4 pounds)\n- Sleeping bag (3 pounds)\n- Water bottle (1 pound)\n- First aid kit (2 pounds)\n- Food (5 pounds)\nThey want to bring all items but can't exceed the weight limit of the backpack. What is the maximum weight they can bring on the hike?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm to find the maximum weight that can be carried without exceeding the backpack's weight limit. We will start by sorting the items by their weight and then adding them to the backpack until the weight limit is reached.\n\n1. Sort the items by weight: Water bottle (1 pound), First aid kit (2 pounds), Sleeping bag (3 pounds), Tent (4 pounds), Food (5 pounds).\n\n2. Add items to the backpack, starting with the lightest item and moving to the heaviest, until the weight limit is reached or all items are added.\n\n- Add the water bottle (1 pound): Total weight = 1 pound\n- Add the first aid kit (2 pounds): Total weight = 3 pounds\n- Add the sleeping bag (3 pounds): Total weight = 6 pounds\n- Add the tent (4 pounds): Total weight = 10 pounds (reached the weight limit)\n\nThe maximum weight they can bring on the hike is 10 pounds, which includes the water bottle, first aid kit, sleeping bag, and tent."
