    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, player A is given $10 and must offer a proposal to player B on how to split the money. If B accepts the proposal, each player receives their allotted share. If B rejects the proposal, both players receive $0. What is the minimum amount that A can offer to B to ensure that B is willing to accept the proposal?",
    "message_2": "In an ultimatum game, the minimum amount that A can offer to B to ensure that B is willing to accept the proposal is $0.01. This is because any positive amount is better than receiving $0 if B rejects the proposal. However, it's important to note that in real-life situations, people may not always act rationally, and B might reject an offer that is perceived as unfair, even if it means getting nothing."
