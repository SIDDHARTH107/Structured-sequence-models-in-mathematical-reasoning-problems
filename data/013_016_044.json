    "message_1": "Here's a possible precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to game theory and moral hazard:\n\nScenario: A manager in a firm is considering two options for a project: a safe option that would yield a profit of $100,000 with a probability of 0.8 and a risky option that would yield a profit of $200,000 with a probability of 0.5. The manager knows that one of two employees, Alice or Bob, will be assigned to work on the project, and each of them has a different level of effort that they would exert. Alice's level of effort would increase the probability of success of either option by 0.3, whereas Bob's level of effort would increase the probability of success by 0.6. However, the manager cannot observe the actual effort exerted by the employee.\n\nQ: Assuming that both employees have the same salary, what level of effort would maximize the expected profit for the firm, and what is the expected profit with that effort level?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected profit for each option and employee, we need to calculate the expected profit for each combination of option and employee effort level.\n\nFor Alice:\nSafe option: Expected profit = 0.8 (base probability) + 0.3 (Alice's effort) = 1.1, but the maximum probability is 1, so the probability of success is 1.\nExpected profit = $100,000 * 1 = $100,000\n\nRisky option: Expected profit = 0.5 (base probability) + 0.3 (Alice's effort) = 0.8\nExpected profit = $200,000 * 0.8 = $160,000\n\nFor Bob:\nSafe option: Expected profit = 0.8 (base probability) + 0.6 (Bob's effort) = 1.4, but the maximum probability is 1, so the probability of success is 1.\nExpected profit = $100,000 * 1 = $100,000\n\nRisky option: Expected profit = 0.5 (base probability) + 0.6 (Bob's effort) = 1.1, but the maximum probability is 1, so the probability of success is 1.\nExpected profit = $200,000 * 1 = $200,000\n\nComparing the expected profits for each option and employee, we can see that assigning Bob to the risky option would maximize the expected profit for the firm, with an expected profit of $200,000."
