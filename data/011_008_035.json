    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which are used to count the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets. The Stirling number of the second kind is denoted as S(n, k).\n\nIn this case, we have 7 distinguishable balls (n = 7) and 4 indistinguishable boxes (k = 4). So, we need to find the value of S(7, 4).\n\nThe Stirling numbers of the second kind can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nwith the base cases:\n\nS(n, 0) = 0 if n > 0\nS(0, 0) = 1\nS(n, n) = 1 for n > 0\n\nUsing the recurrence relation, we can compute the Stirling numbers for our problem:\n\nS(7, 4) = 4 * S(6, 4) + S(6, 3)\n\nNow we need to compute S(6, 4) and S(6, 3):\n\nS(6, 4) = 4 * S(5, 4) + S(5, 3)\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\n\nContinuing the calculations:\n\nS(5, 4) = 4 * S(4, 4) + S(4, 3) = 4 * 1 + 6 = 10\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\nS(5, 2) = 2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1) = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15\n\nNow we can substitute the values back:\n\nS(6, 4) = 4 * 10 + 25 = 65\nS(6, 3) = 3 * 25 + 15 = 90\n\nFinally, we get the answer:\n\nS(7, 4) = 4 * 65 + 90 = 350\n\nSo, there are 350 different ways to put 7 distinguishable balls into 4 indistinguishable boxes such that each box contains at least one ball."
