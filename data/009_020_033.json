    "message_2": "To find the optimal control function u(t) that minimizes the performance index J, we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's define the Hamiltonian function H:\n\nH = y(t)² + u(t)² + λ(t)[y''(t) + 3y'(t) + 2y(t) - u(t)]\n\nwhere λ(t) is the costate variable. The necessary conditions for the optimal control are:\n\n1. ∂H/∂u(t) = 0\n2. λ'(t) = -∂H/∂y(t)\n3. λ''(t) = -∂H/∂y'(t)\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂H/∂u(t) = 2u(t) - λ(t)\n∂H/∂y(t) = 2y(t) + 2λ(t)\n∂H/∂y'(t) = 3λ(t)\n\nFrom condition 1, we have:\n\n2u(t) - λ(t) = 0\nu(t) = λ(t)/2\n\nNow, let's find λ(t) using conditions 2 and 3:\n\nλ'(t) = -2y(t) - 2λ(t)\nλ''(t) = -3λ(t)\n\nSolving the above differential equation for λ(t), we get:\n\nλ(t) = C1 * exp(-t) + C2 * exp(-2t)\n\nNow, we can find u(t) using the expression u(t) = λ(t)/2:\n\nu(t) = (C1 * exp(-t) + C2 * exp(-2t))/2\n\nTo find the constants C1 and C2, we need to use the initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 1:\n\ny(0) = 0 = (C1 * exp(0) + C2 * exp(0))/2\nC1 + C2 = 0\nC2 = -C1\n\ny'(0) = 1 = (-C1 * exp(0) - 2C2 * exp(0))/2\n-2C1 = 1\nC1 = -1/2\n\nSo, C2 = 1/2, and the optimal control function u(t) is:\n\nu(t) = (-1/2 * exp(-t) + 1/2 * exp(-2t))/2\n\nNow, we can find the value of the performance index J for the optimal control function u(t):\n\nJ = ∫[0,1/2] ( y(t)² + u(t)² ) dt\n\nSubstitute the expression for u(t) into the integral and evaluate:\n\nJ = ∫[0,1/2] ( y(t)² + ((-1/2 * exp(-t) + 1/2 * exp(-2t))/2)² ) dt\n\nTo find the exact value of J, we would need to find the expression for y(t) and then evaluate the integral. However, this integral is quite complex and may not have a closed-form solution. Instead, we can use numerical methods to approximate the value of J for the optimal control function u(t)."
