    "message_2": "No, A is not a connected set in X.\n\nTo show this, we will prove that A can be written as the union of two non-empty disjoint open sets in X.\n\nLet A be the set of all rational numbers in X. Consider the sets B and C defined as follows:\n\nB = {x ∈ A | x < √2}\nC = {x ∈ A | x > √2}\n\nNote that √2 is an irrational number, so it is not in A. Also, B and C are non-empty since there are rational numbers smaller than and greater than √2.\n\nNow, we will show that B and C are open in X. Let x ∈ B. Since x is a rational number and x < √2, there exists an open interval (a, b) containing x such that a < x < b < √2. This interval is a subset of B, so x is an interior point of B. Therefore, B is open in X.\n\nSimilarly, let x ∈ C. Since x is a rational number and x > √2, there exists an open interval (a, b) containing x such that √2 < a < x < b. This interval is a subset of C, so x is an interior point of C. Therefore, C is open in X.\n\nFinally, we have A = B ∪ C, and B ∩ C = ∅. Since A can be written as the union of two non-empty disjoint open sets in X, A is not connected in X."
