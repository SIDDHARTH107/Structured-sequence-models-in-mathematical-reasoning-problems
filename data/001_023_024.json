    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(2x) = 0.6, we first need to find the angle whose sine is 0.6. \n\nStep 1: Find the inverse sine of 0.6\nx1 = arcsin(0.6)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\nx1 ≈ 36.87°\n\nSince sine has a period of 360°, we can find another angle in the first period by subtracting the found angle from 180°:\nx2 = 180° - x1\nx2 = 180° - 36.87°\nx2 ≈ 143.13°\n\nNow, we have two angles, x1 and x2, for which sin(x) = 0.6. However, our equation is sin(2x) = 0.6, so we need to divide these angles by 2 to find the values of x:\n\nx1' = x1 / 2\nx1' ≈ 36.87° / 2\nx1' ≈ 18° (rounded to the nearest degree)\n\nx2' = x2 / 2\nx2' ≈ 143.13° / 2\nx2' ≈ 72° (rounded to the nearest degree)\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given range are x ≈ 18° and x ≈ 72°."
