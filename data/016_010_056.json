    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by starting with three mutually tangent circles and adding a fourth circle tangent to all three. The curvatures of the circles are related by Descartes' Circle Theorem, which states that if four circles have curvatures $k_1, k_2, k_3,$ and $k_4$, then:\n\n$(k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4)^2 = 2(k_1^2 + k_2^2 + k_3^2 + k_4^2)$\n\nWe are given the initial curvatures $k_1 = 3, k_2 = 4,$ and $k_3 = 5$. We need to find the curvature $k_4$ of the fourth circle.\n\nSubstituting the given values into Descartes' Circle Theorem:\n\n$(3 + 4 + 5 + k_4)^2 = 2(3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + k_4^2)$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$(12 + k_4)^2 = 2(9 + 16 + 25 + k_4^2)$\n$(12 + k_4)^2 = 2(50 + k_4^2)$\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n$144 + 24k_4 + k_4^2 = 100 + 2k_4^2$\n$k_4^2 - 24k_4 + 44 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $k_4$. Solving for $k_4$ using the quadratic formula:\n\n$k_4 = \\frac{-(-24) \\pm \\sqrt{(-24)^2 - 4(44)}}{2}$\n$k_4 = \\frac{24 \\pm \\sqrt{576 - 176}}{2}$\n$k_4 = \\frac{24 \\pm \\sqrt{400}}{2}$\n$k_4 = \\frac{24 \\pm 20}{2}$\n\nWe have two possible values for $k_4$: $k_4 = 2$ or $k_4 = 22$. However, since the fourth circle is enclosed by the initial three circles, its curvature must be greater than the curvatures of the initial circles. Therefore, $k_4 = 22$.\n\nNow, we can find the sum of the curvatures of the four tangent circles:\n\n$k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 = 3 + 4 + 5 + 22 = 34$."
