    "message_2": "The total length of a Hilbert curve of order n with each individual line segment of length l can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal length = l * (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nIn this case, we have l = 2 cm and n = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nTotal length = 2 * (4^3 - 1) / 3\nTotal length = 2 * (64 - 1) / 3\nTotal length = 2 * 63 / 3\nTotal length = 126 / 3\nTotal length = 42 cm\n\nSo, the total length of the Hilbert curve of order 3 with each individual line segment of length 2 cm is 42 cm."
