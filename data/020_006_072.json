However, the company has room in its budget for only three projects. Which three projects should the company select to maximize its profit?\n\n| Project | Profit | Resources Required | Time Required |\n|---------|--------|--------------------|---------------|\n| A       | 50     | 7                  | 5             |\n| B       | 40     | 4                  | 3             |\n| C       | 30     | 5                  | 4             |\n| D       | 20     | 3                  | 2             |\n| E       | 60     | 8                  | 6             | \n\nNote: Resources and time are limited and therefore the company cannot undertake more than what it can handle.",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to consider the profit per resource and time required for each project. We can calculate this by dividing the profit by the sum of resources and time required for each project.\n\n| Project | Profit | Resources Required | Time Required | Profit per Resource & Time |\n|---------|--------|--------------------|---------------|----------------------------|\n| A       | 50     | 7                  | 5             | 50/(7+5) = 50/12 = 4.17     |\n| B       | 40     | 4                  | 3             | 40/(4+3) = 40/7 = 5.71      |\n| C       | 30     | 5                  | 4             | 30/(5+4) = 30/9 = 3.33      |\n| D       | 20     | 3                  | 2             | 20/(3+2) = 20/5 = 4.00      |\n| E       | 60     | 8                  | 6             | 60/(8+6) = 60/14 = 4.29     |\n\nNow, we can rank the projects based on their profit per resource and time:\n\n1. Project B: 5.71\n2. Project E: 4.29\n3. Project A: 4.17\n4. Project D: 4.00\n5. Project C: 3.33\n\nBased on this ranking, the company should select projects B, E, and A to maximize its profit."
