    "message_1": "A company produces two types of printers. The first printer costs $70 to produce and the second printer costs $100 to produce. The company sells the first printer for $120 and the second printer for $150. The demand for the first printer is 500 units and the demand for the second printer is 400 units. How many units of each printer should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, the company should produce as many units as there is demand for each printer, since the selling price is higher than the production cost for both types of printers.\n\nFor the first printer:\nProduction cost: $70\nSelling price: $120\nProfit per unit: $120 - $70 = $50\nDemand: 500 units\n\nFor the second printer:\nProduction cost: $100\nSelling price: $150\nProfit per unit: $150 - $100 = $50\nDemand: 400 units\n\nTo maximize profit, the company should produce 500 units of the first printer and 400 units of the second printer."
