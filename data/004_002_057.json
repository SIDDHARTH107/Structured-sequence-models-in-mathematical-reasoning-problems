    "message_2": "To find the limit of f(x) as x approaches 1, we can first try to simplify the function by factoring the numerator and canceling out any common factors with the denominator.\n\nf(x) = (2x^2 - 5x + 3)/(x - 1)\n\nFirst, let's factor the numerator:\n\n2x^2 - 5x + 3 = (2x - 1)(x - 3)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(x) = ((2x - 1)(x - 3))/(x - 1)\n\nSince we are looking for the limit as x approaches 1, we can see that there is a hole in the function at x = 1, as the (x - 1) term cancels out. Therefore, we can simplify the function further by removing the (x - 1) term:\n\nf(x) = 2x - 1\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 1:\n\nlim (x -> 1) (2x - 1)\n\n= 2(1) - 1\n\n= 2 - 1\n\n= 1\n\nSo, the limit of f(x) as x approaches 1 is 1."
