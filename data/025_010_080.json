    "message_1": "Let X be a non-singular projective plane curve of degree 4, defined over the complex numbers. Let D be a divisor on X, with degree 5, and such that the linear system|D| has dimension 1. Find the genus of X.",
    "message_2": "To find the genus of X, we can use the genus-degree formula for non-singular projective plane curves, which is given by:\n\ng = (d - 1)(d - 2)/2,\n\nwhere g is the genus and d is the degree of the curve.\n\nIn this case, the degree of the curve X is 4, so we can plug this value into the formula:\n\ng = (4 - 1)(4 - 2)/2\ng = (3)(2)/2\ng = 3\n\nTherefore, the genus of the non-singular projective plane curve X is 3."
