    "message_2": "To solve for $z$, we first need to get all the terms containing $z$ on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. \n\n$(3+2i)z - (1-4i) = (5-3i)z + (2+5i)$\n\nNow, we'll move the $(5-3i)z$ term to the left side and the $(1-4i)$ term to the right side:\n\n$(3+2i)z - (5-3i)z = (2+5i) + (1-4i)$\n\nNow, we'll combine the terms on both sides:\n\n$[(3+2i) - (5-3i)]z = (2+5i) + (1-4i)$\n\n$[(3+2i) - 5 + 3i]z = 2 + 5i + 1 - 4i$\n\n$(3 - 5 + 2i + 3i)z = 3 + i$\n\n$(-2 + 5i)z = 3 + i$\n\nNow, to solve for $z$, we'll divide both sides by $(-2 + 5i)$:\n\n$z = \\frac{3 + i}{-2 + 5i}$\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary part in the denominator, we'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $(-2 - 5i)$:\n\n$z = \\frac{(3 + i)(-2 - 5i)}{(-2 + 5i)(-2 - 5i)}$\n\nNow, we'll multiply the numerators and denominators:\n\n$z = \\frac{(-6 - 15i - 2i - 5i^2)}{(-2)^2 - 2(5i)(-5i) + (5i)^2}$\n\nSince $i^2 = -1$, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$z = \\frac{(-6 - 17i + 5)}{(4 + 50 - 25i^2)}$\n\n$z = \\frac{-1 - 17i}{4 + 50 + 25}$\n\n$z = \\frac{-1 - 17i}{79}$\n\nNow, we can write the final answer as:\n\n$z = -\\frac{1}{79} - \\frac{17}{79}i$"
