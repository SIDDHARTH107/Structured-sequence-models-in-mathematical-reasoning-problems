    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nIn this graph, we can see that it forms a cycle with 8 vertices. To determine the chromatic number, we can try to color the vertices with the minimum number of colors while ensuring that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nWe can start by coloring vertex 1 with color A. Then, vertex 2 must have a different color, so we color it with color B. Vertex 3 must have a different color from vertex 2, so we color it with color A. We can continue this pattern, alternating between colors A and B, until we reach vertex 8. Since vertex 8 is connected to both vertex 1 (color A) and vertex 7 (color B), we need a third color, color C, for vertex 8.\n\nThus, the chromatic number of this graph is 3."
