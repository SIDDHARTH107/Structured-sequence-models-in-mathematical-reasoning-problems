    "message_1": "A car of mass 1000 kg is travelling on a flat, straight road at a constant speed of 20 m/s. Suddenly, the brakes are applied and the car comes to a stop in 4 seconds. What is the average force applied by the brakes to stop the car? Use calculus to solve.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using calculus, we need to find the acceleration of the car and then use Newton's second law of motion to find the force applied by the brakes.\n\nFirst, let's find the acceleration. Since the car comes to a stop in 4 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity (0 m/s), u is the initial velocity (20 m/s), a is the acceleration, and t is the time (4 seconds).\n\n0 = 20 + a(4)\n\nSolving for a, we get:\n\na = -5 m/s^2\n\nNow, we can use Newton's second law of motion, F = ma, to find the force applied by the brakes:\n\nF = (1000 kg)(-5 m/s^2)\n\nF = -5000 N\n\nSince the force is negative, it means that the force is acting in the opposite direction of the car's motion, which is expected for braking. The average force applied by the brakes to stop the car is 5000 N."
