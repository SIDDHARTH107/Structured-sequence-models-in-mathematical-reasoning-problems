    "message_1": "A company produces a certain type of computer component in a batch of 800. The probability that each component is defective is 0.05. What is the probability that the batch contains exactly 40 defective components?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective components\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of components (800 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective components we want to find the probability for (40 in this case)\n- p is the probability of a component being defective (0.05 in this case)\n\nFirst, we need to find C(800, 40), which is the number of ways to choose 40 defective components out of 800:\n\nC(800, 40) = 800! / (40! * (800-40)!)\nC(800, 40) = 800! / (40! * 760!)\n\nNext, we need to calculate p^k and (1-p)^(n-k):\n\np^k = 0.05^40\n(1-p)^(n-k) = (1-0.05)^(800-40) = 0.95^760\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 40) = C(800, 40) * 0.05^40 * 0.95^760\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nP(X = 40) â‰ˆ 0.102\n\nSo, the probability that the batch contains exactly 40 defective components is approximately 10.2%."
