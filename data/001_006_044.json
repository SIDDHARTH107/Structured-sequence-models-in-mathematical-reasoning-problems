    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic function y = -2x² + 8x - 10, we can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: x = -b / 2a, where a = -2 and b = 8.\n\nx = -8 / (2 * -2)\nx = -8 / -4\nx = 2\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can plug it back into the equation to find the y-coordinate:\n\ny = -2(2)² + 8(2) - 10\ny = -2(4) + 16 - 10\ny = -8 + 16 - 10\ny = 8 - 10\ny = -2\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic function is (2, -2).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is x = 2.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = -2(0)² + 8(0) - 10\ny = -10\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, -10).\n\nIn summary:\n- Vertex: (2, -2)\n- Axis of symmetry: x = 2\n- Y-intercept: (0, -10)"
