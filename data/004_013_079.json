    "message_2": "To find the local maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 2x³ - 9x² + 12x + 6 on the interval [0, 4], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or is undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d(2x³ - 9x² + 12x + 6)/dx = 6x² - 18x + 12\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0:\n\n6x² - 18x + 12 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first simplify it by dividing all terms by 6:\n\nx² - 3x + 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor this equation:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two critical points:\n\nx = 1 and x = 2\n\nNow, we need to check the values of the function f(x) at these critical points, as well as at the endpoints of the interval [0, 4]:\n\nf(0) = 2(0)³ - 9(0)² + 12(0) + 6 = 6\nf(1) = 2(1)³ - 9(1)² + 12(1) + 6 = 2 - 9 + 12 + 6 = 11\nf(2) = 2(2)³ - 9(2)² + 12(2) + 6 = 16 - 36 + 24 + 6 = 10\nf(4) = 2(4)³ - 9(4)² + 12(4) + 6 = 128 - 144 + 48 + 6 = 38\n\nComparing these values, we find that the local maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 4] is 11 at x = 1, and the local minimum value is 6 at x = 0."
