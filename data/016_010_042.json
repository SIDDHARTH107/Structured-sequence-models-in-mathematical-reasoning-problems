    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the interstices between mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. If the initial configuration consists of three mutually tangent circles, an infinite number of circles will be used to construct the complete Apollonian gasket, as the process of adding circles can continue indefinitely, filling smaller and smaller spaces between the existing circles."
