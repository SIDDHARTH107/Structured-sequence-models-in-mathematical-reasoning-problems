    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one hurricane hitting the coastal city in the next three years, we can first find the probability of no hurricanes hitting the city in the next three years and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no hurricane hitting the city in a given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor three consecutive years with no hurricanes, we multiply the probabilities: 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.857375.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of at least one hurricane hitting the city in the next three years: 1 - 0.857375 = 0.142625.\n\nSo, the probability of at least one hurricane hitting the coastal city in the next three years is approximately 0.1426 or 14.26%."
