    "message_2": "To prove that the set of critical points of f is a smooth submanifold of M of dimension 2, we will use the Regular Level Set Theorem. The theorem states that if f: M → R is a smooth function on a smooth manifold M, and c is a regular value of f (i.e., df_p is surjective for all p in f^(-1)(c)), then the level set f^(-1)(c) is a smooth submanifold of M with dimension equal to dim(M) - dim(R).\n\nIn our case, we are given that the derivative of f with respect to any coordinate chart is nonzero. This implies that df_p is surjective for all p in M. Therefore, every value of f is a regular value. Let c be a critical value of f, i.e., a value such that df_p = 0 for some p in f^(-1)(c). Then, the level set f^(-1)(c) is a smooth submanifold of M with dimension equal to dim(M) - dim(R) = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nNow, let's find the number of critical points of the function f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 on the sphere S^2 with radius 1. The sphere S^2 is defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1. The gradient of f is given by ∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z). A critical point occurs when the gradient is orthogonal to the tangent plane of the sphere at that point. The tangent plane of the sphere at a point (x, y, z) is given by the equation x*dx + y*dy + z*dz = 0.\n\nThe gradient is orthogonal to the tangent plane if their dot product is zero, i.e., (2x, 2y, 2z) • (x*dx + y*dy + z*dz) = 0. Expanding the dot product, we get 2x^2*dx + 2y^2*dy + 2z^2*dz = 0. Since x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, we have 2*dx + 2*dy + 2*dz = 0, which simplifies to dx + dy + dz = 0.\n\nThis equation represents a plane in the tangent space of the sphere, which means that there is a unique critical point for each tangent plane. Since there are infinitely many tangent planes on the sphere, there are infinitely many critical points of the function f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 on the sphere S^2 with radius 1."
