    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to any of these groups, we will use the Sylow theorems. Recall that the order of a group is the number of elements in the group. The Sylow theorems provide information about the possible structure of a group based on its order.\n\nFirst, let's find the Sylow subgroups of G. The order of G is 40, which can be factored as 2^3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 5 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_5 divides 8 and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nFor n_2, the possible values are 1 and 5. For n_5, the possible values are 1 and 8.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. Both P_2 and P_5 are normal in G since they are unique. The product of their orders is equal to the order of G, so by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is a direct product of P_2 and P_5, i.e., G ≅ P_2 × P_5. Since P_2 and P_5 are cyclic (orders 8 and 5 are prime powers), G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_5 = 8\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 8 and eight Sylow 5-subgroups of order 5. P_2 is normal in G, but the Sylow 5-subgroups are not. Since P_2 is normal and has order 8, it must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C8, C4 × C2, or D4. We can rule out C8 and C4 × C2 because they would force G to be abelian, which contradicts the assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, P_2 must be isomorphic to D4.\n\nNow, let P_5 be one of the Sylow 5-subgroups. Since P_5 has order 5, it is cyclic and isomorphic to C5. The semi-direct product of P_2 and P_5 gives a non-abelian group of order 40. This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D20.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 5, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there are five Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 of order 5. P_5 is normal in G, but the Sylow 2-subgroups are not. Since P_5 is normal and has order 5, it must be isomorphic to C5. The semi-direct product of one of the Sylow 2-subgroups and P_5 gives a non-abelian group of order 40. There are eight such non-abelian groups, which are distinct from the cyclic group C40 and the dihedral group D20.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C40, the dihedral group D20, or one of the eight non-abelian groups of order 40, depending on the number of Sylow subgroups."
