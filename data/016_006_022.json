    "message_2": "The Barnsley fern fractal is generated using an iterated function system (IFS) consisting of four affine transformations. Each transformation has an associated probability and a scaling factor. The scaling factors for the four transformations are as follows:\n\n1. Transformation 1 (Stem): Scaling factor = 0.01\n2. Transformation 2 (Successively smaller leaflets): Scaling factor = 0.85\n3. Transformation 3 (Largest left-hand leaflet): Scaling factor = 0.2\n4. Transformation 4 (Largest right-hand leaflet): Scaling factor = 0.2\n\nThe smallest scaling factor among these four transformations is for the stem, which is 0.01."
