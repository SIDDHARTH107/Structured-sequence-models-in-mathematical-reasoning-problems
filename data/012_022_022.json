    "message_2": "The smallest number R is 6. This can be proven using Ramsey's theorem, which states that for any given integers p and q, there exists a smallest integer R(p, q) such that any graph with R(p, q) vertices will contain either a complete subgraph on p vertices or an independent set of size q.\n\nIn this case, we are looking for the smallest R such that any graph on R vertices is either guaranteed to contain a complete subgraph on 3 vertices (p = 3) or a subgraph with an independent set of size 3 (q = 3). Therefore, we want to find R(3, 3).\n\nRamsey's theorem can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR(p, q) = R(p-1, q) + R(p, q-1) for p, q > 1\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate R(3, 3) as follows:\n\nR(3, 3) = R(2, 3) + R(3, 2)\n\nSince R(2, q) = q and R(p, 2) = p for any p and q, we can simplify the equation:\n\nR(3, 3) = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the smallest number R is 6. This means that any graph with 6 vertices will either contain a complete subgraph on 3 vertices or a subgraph with an independent set of size 3."
