    "message_2": "To find the image of the upper half-plane under the mapping $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z+\\frac{1}{2}}$, we first need to find the image of the boundary of the upper half-plane, which is the real axis. Let $z = x$ be a real number, then\n\n$$f(x) = \\frac{1}{x+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{2}{2x+1}.$$\n\nSince $x$ is real, $f(x)$ is also real. Therefore, the image of the real axis under the mapping $f(z)$ is still the real axis.\n\nNow, let $z = x + iy$ be a point in the upper half-plane, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $y > 0$. Then\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{(x + iy) + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{x + \\frac{1}{2} + iy} = \\frac{2}{2x+1 + 2iy}.$$\n\nTo find the image of this point, we can compute the conjugate of $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(\\overline{z}) = \\frac{1}{(x - iy) + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{x + \\frac{1}{2} - iy} = \\frac{2}{2x+1 - 2iy}.$$\n\nNow, we can use the Schwarz reflection principle, which states that if $f(z)$ is analytic in the upper half-plane and maps the real axis to itself, then the function $g(z) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$ is analytic in the lower half-plane and maps the real axis to itself.\n\nSo, let's compute $g(z) = \\overline{f(\\overline{z})}$:\n\n$$g(z) = \\overline{\\frac{2}{2x+1 - 2iy}} = \\frac{2}{2x+1 + 2iy} = f(z).$$\n\nSince $g(z) = f(z)$, the mapping $f(z)$ is symmetric with respect to the real axis. Therefore, the image of the upper half-plane under the mapping $f(z)$ is the lower half-plane."
