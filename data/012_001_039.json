Calculate the distance of the shortest path and list the vertices in order.",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest path from vertex A to vertex E, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Create a set of unvisited vertices and initialize the distance of the starting vertex (A) to 0 and the distances of all other vertices to infinity.\n\n2. Select the vertex with the smallest distance (A) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its adjacent vertices (B and C) if the new distance is smaller than the current distance.\n\n3. Select the next unvisited vertex with the smallest distance (B) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its adjacent vertices (C and D) if the new distance is smaller than the current distance.\n\n4. Select the next unvisited vertex with the smallest distance (C) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its adjacent vertices (D and E) if the new distance is smaller than the current distance.\n\n5. Select the next unvisited vertex with the smallest distance (D) and mark it as visited. Update the distances of its adjacent vertices (E) if the new distance is smaller than the current distance.\n\n6. Select the next unvisited vertex with the smallest distance (E) and mark it as visited. Since this is the destination vertex, we can stop the algorithm.\n\nThe shortest path from vertex A to vertex E is A -> B -> D -> E, with a total distance of 2 + 3 + 1 = 6."
