Therefore, b_n = 0 for all n.\n\nNow, we need to find a_n:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[x(π - x) * cos(2πnx/π) dx] from 0 to π\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[x(π - x) * cos(2nx) dx] from 0 to π\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use integration by parts twice:\n\nFirst integration by parts:\nu = x(π - x), dv = cos(2nx) dx\ndu = (π - 2x) dx, v = (1/2n) * sin(2nx)\n\nSecond integration by parts:\nu = (π - 2x), dv = (1/2n) * sin(2nx) dx\ndu = -2 dx, v = -(1/4n^2) * cos(2nx)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(1/2n) * x(π - x) * sin(2nx) - ∫(π - 2x) * (1/2n) * sin(2nx) dx] from 0 to π\na_n = (2/π) * [(1/2n) * x(π - x) * sin(2nx) + (1/2n) * ∫(π - 2x) * sin(2nx) dx] from 0 to π\na_n = (2/π) * [(1/2n) * x(π - x) * sin(2nx) + (1/2n) * [-(1/4n^2) * (π - 2x) * cos(2nx) - ∫-2 * (1/4n^2) * cos(2nx) dx]] from 0 to π\na_n = (2/π) * [(1/2n) * x(π - x) * sin(2nx) + (1/2n) * [-(1/4n^2) * (π - 2x) * cos(2nx) + (1/2n^2) * sin(2nx)]] from 0 to π\n\nEvaluating at the limits:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [0 + (1/2n) * [-(1/4n^2) * (π - 2π) * cos(2nπ) + (1/2n^2) * sin(2nπ)] - 0]\na_n = (2/π) * [(1/2n) * (1/2n^2) * sin(2nπ)]\na_n = 0, since sin(2nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n\n\nSo, a_n = 0 for all n ≥ 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x(π - x) is:\n\nf(x) = (π^2)/2, since a_0 = π^2 and all other coefficients are 0."
