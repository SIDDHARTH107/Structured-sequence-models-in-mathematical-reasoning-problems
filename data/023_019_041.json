The system is stable if the real part of λ is negative for all eigenvalues of the system.",
    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system, we first need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix associated with the system. The system can be written in matrix form as:\n\nd/dt [x, y]^T = [3, -1; -4, -1] [x, y]^T\n\nThe matrix A is:\n\nA = [3, -1;\n     -4, -1]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation:\n\ndet(A - λI) = 0\n\nwhere I is the identity matrix and λ are the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation for matrix A is:\n\ndet([3 - λ, -1;\n     -4, -1 - λ]) = 0\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\n(3 - λ)(-1 - λ) - (-1)(-4) = 0\n(3 - λ)(-1 - λ) + 4 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n-3 + λ - 3λ + λ^2 + 4 = 0\nλ^2 - 2λ + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for λ using the quadratic formula:\n\nλ = (2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(1))) / (2 * 1)\nλ = (2 ± 0) / 2\nλ = 1\n\nSince there is only one eigenvalue, λ = 1, and its real part is positive, the system is unstable."
