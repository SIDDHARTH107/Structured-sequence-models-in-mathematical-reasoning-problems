    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true average math score of all students in the school, we will use the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nx̄ = sample mean (average math score)\nZ = Z-score (1.96 for a 95% confidence interval)\nσ = standard deviation\nn = sample size\n\nGiven the information provided:\nx̄ = 80\nσ = 10\nn = 100\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = 80 ± (1.96 * (10 / √100))\n\nConfidence Interval = 80 ± (1.96 * (10 / 10))\n\nConfidence Interval = 80 ± (1.96 * 1)\n\nConfidence Interval = 80 ± 1.96\n\nLower limit = 80 - 1.96 = 78.04\nUpper limit = 80 + 1.96 = 81.96\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average math score of all students in the school is approximately (78.04, 81.96)."
