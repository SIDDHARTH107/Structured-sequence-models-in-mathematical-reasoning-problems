    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 48 = 2^4 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups: To do this, we can use the formula for the number of partitions of a number. For 2^4, there are 5 partitions (1+1+1+1, 2+1+1, 2+2, 4+1, and 4). For 3^1, there is only 1 partition (1). Therefore, there are 5 * 1 = 5 abelian groups of order 48.\n3. Determine the number of non-abelian groups: To do this, we can use the formula for the number of groups of order p^n * q^m, where p and q are distinct primes, and n and m are their respective powers. The formula is (n+1)(m+1) - 1. In our case, n = 4 and m = 1, so the formula gives (4+1)(1+1) - 1 = 9. However, this includes the abelian groups we already counted, so we need to subtract those: 9 - 5 = 4 non-abelian groups.\n\nSo, there are a total of 5 abelian groups and 4 non-abelian groups, which gives us 5 + 4 = 9 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
