    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot oligopoly with two firms, where the total market demand is given by P = 20 - Q. The marginal cost functions of both firms are given by MC1 = 2Q1 and MC2 = 4Q2, respectively. What will be the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm, and what will be the price in the market?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantity produced by each firm and the price in the market, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the reaction functions for both firms.\n2. Solve for the Nash equilibrium by equating the reaction functions.\n3. Calculate the total quantity produced in the market (Q = Q1 + Q2).\n4. Find the market price using the demand function.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction functions for both firms.\n\nFirm 1's profit function is given by:\nπ1 = (P * Q1) - (TC1)\nwhere TC1 is the total cost for firm 1.\n\nWe know that P = 20 - Q and Q = Q1 + Q2. So, we can rewrite the profit function as:\nπ1 = ((20 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q1) - (TC1)\n\nTo find the total cost function, we integrate the marginal cost function:\nTC1 = ∫MC1 dQ1 = ∫2Q1 dQ1 = Q1^2 + C1\nSince there is no fixed cost, C1 = 0, and TC1 = Q1^2.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the profit function as:\nπ1 = ((20 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q1) - (Q1^2)\n\nTo find the reaction function, we differentiate the profit function with respect to Q1 and set it equal to 0:\ndπ1/dQ1 = 20 - 2Q1 - Q2 - 2Q1 = 0\n\nSolving for Q1, we get the reaction function for firm 1:\nQ1 = (20 - Q2)/4\n\nSimilarly, for firm 2, the profit function is given by:\nπ2 = (P * Q2) - (TC2)\n\nWe can rewrite the profit function as:\nπ2 = ((20 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q2) - (TC2)\n\nThe total cost function for firm 2 is:\nTC2 = ∫MC2 dQ2 = ∫4Q2 dQ2 = 2Q2^2 + C2\nSince there is no fixed cost, C2 = 0, and TC2 = 2Q2^2.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the profit function as:\nπ2 = ((20 - (Q1 + Q2)) * Q2) - (2Q2^2)\n\nTo find the reaction function, we differentiate the profit function with respect to Q2 and set it equal to 0:\ndπ2/dQ2 = 20 - Q1 - 2Q2 - 4Q2 = 0\n\nSolving for Q2, we get the reaction function for firm 2:\nQ2 = (20 - Q1)/6\n\nStep 2: Solve for the Nash equilibrium by equating the reaction functions.\n\nQ1 = (20 - Q2)/4\nQ2 = (20 - Q1)/6\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\nQ2 = (20 - (20 - Q2)/4)/6\n\nSolving for Q2, we get:\nQ2 = 8/3\n\nNow, substituting Q2 back into the first equation, we get:\nQ1 = (20 - 8/3)/4\n\nSolving for Q1, we get:\nQ1 = 4\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total quantity produced in the market (Q = Q1 + Q2).\n\nQ = Q1 + Q2 = 4 + 8/3 = 20/3\n\nStep 4: Find the market price using the demand function.\n\nP = 20 - Q = 20 - 20/3 = 40/3\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantities produced by each firm are Q1 = 4 and Q2 = 8/3, and the market price is P = 40/3."
