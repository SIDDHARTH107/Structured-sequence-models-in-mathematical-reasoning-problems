    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate z from the first and second equations, and from the first and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by -1 and add it to the second equation, and multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the third equation.\n\n-1 * (x + y + z) = -1 * 6\n-1x -1y -1z = -6\n\nNow, add this to the second equation:\n(-1x -1y -1z) + (2x - 3y + z) = -6 + (-4)\nx - 4y = -10  (1)\n\nNext, multiply the first equation by -2 and add it to the third equation:\n-2 * (x + y + z) = -2 * 6\n-2x -2y -2z = -12\n\nNow, add this to the third equation:\n(-2x -2y -2z) + (4x + y + 2z) = -12 + 9\n2x - y = -3  (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\nx - 4y = -10  (1)\n2x - y = -3   (2)\n\nNext, we will eliminate x from these two equations. Multiply the first equation by 2 and add it to the second equation:\n\n2 * (x - 4y) = 2 * (-10)\n2x - 8y = -20\n\nNow, add this to the second equation:\n(2x - 8y) + (2x - y) = -20 + (-3)\n4x - 9y = -23\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n4x = 9y - 23\nx = (9y - 23) / 4\n\nNow, substitute this value of x back into equation (1):\nx - 4y = -10\n(9y - 23) / 4 - 4y = -10\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n9y - 23 - 16y = -40\n\nCombine like terms:\n-7y = -17\n\nNow, solve for y:\ny = 17 / 7\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the equation for x:\nx = (9y - 23) / 4\nx = (9 * (17/7) - 23) / 4\nx = (153/7 - 23) / 4\nx = (153 - 161) / 28\nx = -8 / 28\nx = -2 / 7\n\nNow that we have the values of x and y, we can substitute them back into the original equation to find the value of z:\n\nx + y + z = 6\n(-2/7) + (17/7) + z = 6\n15/7 + z = 6\n\nSubtract 15/7 from both sides:\nz = 6 - 15/7\nz = (42 - 15) / 7\nz = 27/7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\nx = -2/7, y = 17/7, and z = 27/7."
