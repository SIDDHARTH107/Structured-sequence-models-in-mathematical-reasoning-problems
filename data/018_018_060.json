    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union and intersection of sets A and B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nTo verify that the symmetric difference is commutative, we can calculate B Δ A and check if it is equal to A Δ B:\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection are commutative, we have:\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nB ∩ A = {3, 4}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nSince A Δ B = B Δ A = {1, 2, 5, 6}, the symmetric difference is commutative."
