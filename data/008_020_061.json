    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of operations to transform the augmented matrix into an upper triangular matrix, and then use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n|  2  -3  -5 |  1 |\n|  5   4  -6 | -2 |\n| -4   7   3 |  3 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we will use the first row as the pivot row. Multiply the first row by appropriate factors and subtract it from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - (5/2)R1\nR3 = R3 + 2R1\n\n|  2  -3  -5 |  1  |\n|  0   8.5  4 | -4.5|\n|  0   1   3 |  5  |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we will use the second row as the pivot row. Multiply the second row by an appropriate factor and subtract it from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - (1/8.5)R2\n\n|  2  -3  -5 |  1   |\n|  0   8.5  4 | -4.5 |\n|  0   0   2.529 | 5.529 |\n\nStep 3: Use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we can find the value of z:\n\n2.529z = 5.529\nz = 5.529 / 2.529\nz ≈ 2.186\n\nNow, substitute the value of z into the second row to find the value of y:\n\n8.5y + 4(2.186) = -4.5\n8.5y ≈ -12.244\ny ≈ -12.244 / 8.5\ny ≈ -1.44\n\nFinally, substitute the values of y and z into the first row to find the value of x:\n\n2x - 3(-1.44) - 5(2.186) = 1\n2x ≈ 1 + 10.93\nx ≈ 11.93 / 2\nx ≈ 5.965\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately:\n\nx ≈ 5.965\ny ≈ -1.44\nz ≈ 2.186"
