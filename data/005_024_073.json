    "message_2": "To find the mean, median, and mode for each car model, we will first calculate them separately for each model.\n\nModel A:\nMean: (45 + 54 + 38 + 51 + 60 + 48) / 6 = 296 / 6 = 49.33\nTo find the median, we first arrange the numbers in ascending order: 38, 45, 48, 51, 54, 60\nMedian: (45 + 48) / 2 = 93 / 2 = 46.5\nThere is no mode for Model A since no number appears more than once.\n\nModel B:\nMean: (20 + 16 + 25 + 21 + 15 + 22) / 6 = 119 / 6 = 19.83\nTo find the median, we first arrange the numbers in ascending order: 15, 16, 20, 21, 22, 25\nMedian: (20 + 21) / 2 = 41 / 2 = 20.5\nThere is no mode for Model B since no number appears more than once.\n\nModel C:\nMean: (35 + 45 + 50 + 30 + 40 + 48) / 6 = 248 / 6 = 41.33\nTo find the median, we first arrange the numbers in ascending order: 30, 35, 40, 45, 48, 50\nMedian: (40 + 45) / 2 = 85 / 2 = 42.5\nThere is no mode for Model C since no number appears more than once.\n\nSo, the mean, median, and mode for each car model are:\n\nModel A:\nMean: 49.33\nMedian: 46.5\nMode: None\n\nModel B:\nMean: 19.83\nMedian: 20.5\nMode: None\n\nModel C:\nMean: 41.33\nMedian: 42.5\nMode: None"
