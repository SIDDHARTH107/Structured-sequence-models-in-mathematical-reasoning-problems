    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that for a closed surface S with Gaussian curvature K, the total curvature is given by:\n\nTotal curvature = ∫∫_S K dA = 2πχ(S)\n\nwhere χ(S) is the Euler characteristic of the surface S. For a sphere, the Euler characteristic is 2.\n\nSo, the total curvature of the sphere S is:\n\nTotal curvature = 2π(2) = 4π\n\nNow, we know that the Gaussian curvature K of a sphere with radius r is given by:\n\nK = 1/r^2\n\nFor a sphere with radius 3, the Gaussian curvature K is:\n\nK = 1/3^2 = 1/9\n\nTo find the total curvature, we can integrate the Gaussian curvature K over the entire surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere with radius r is given by:\n\nSurface area = 4πr^2\n\nFor a sphere with radius 3, the surface area is:\n\nSurface area = 4π(3^2) = 36π\n\nNow, we can find the total curvature by integrating K over the surface area:\n\nTotal curvature = ∫∫_S K dA = (1/9) * 36π = 4π\n\nSo, the total curvature of the sphere S with radius 3 according to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem is 4π."
