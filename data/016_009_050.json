    "message_2": "A dragon curve is a fractal pattern that can be created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The order of a dragon curve refers to the number of times the folding process is repeated.\n\nFor a dragon curve of order n, the total length can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal length = initial segment length * 2^n\n\nIn this case, the initial segment has a length of 1, and we want to find the total length of a dragon curve of order 7. So, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nTotal length = 1 * 2^7 = 1 * 128 = 128\n\nThe total length of a dragon curve of order 7 with an initial segment length of 1 is 128."
