    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine its radius. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nDiameter of the sphere = Side length of the cube = 10 centimeters\n\nNow, we can find the radius of the sphere by dividing the diameter by 2:\n\nRadius of the sphere = Diameter / 2 = 10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the volume of the sphere using the formula:\n\nVolume of the sphere = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nVolume of the sphere = (4/3) * π * (5 cm)^3 = (4/3) * π * 125 cm^3 ≈ 523.6 cm^3\n\nRounded to the nearest cubic centimeter, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 524 cm^3."
