    "message_2": "Let X be a complex projective variety of dimension 3, and let Y be a smooth hyperplane section of X. We are given that the first Betti number of X is equal to 5, i.e., b_1(X) = 5. We want to compute the intersection cohomology groups of Y in terms of the cohomology groups of X.\n\nRecall that the intersection cohomology groups of a smooth variety are isomorphic to its usual cohomology groups. Since Y is a smooth hyperplane section of X, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to relate the cohomology groups of Y and X.\n\nThe Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for a smooth projective variety X of dimension n and a smooth hyperplane section Y, the restriction map H^k(X, Z) -> H^k(Y, Z) is an isomorphism for k < n and an injection for k = n.\n\nIn our case, n = 3, so the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem gives us the following isomorphisms and injection:\n\n1. H^0(X, Z) -> H^0(Y, Z) is an isomorphism.\n2. H^1(X, Z) -> H^1(Y, Z) is an isomorphism.\n3. H^2(X, Z) -> H^2(Y, Z) is an isomorphism.\n4. H^3(X, Z) -> H^3(Y, Z) is an injection.\n\nNow let's compute the cohomology groups of Y:\n\n1. H^0(Y, Z) ≅ H^0(X, Z) = Z, since the zeroth cohomology group is always isomorphic to the integers Z.\n\n2. H^1(Y, Z) ≅ H^1(X, Z). We are given that b_1(X) = 5, which means the rank of H^1(X, Z) is 5. Therefore, H^1(Y, Z) ≅ Z^5.\n\n3. H^2(Y, Z) ≅ H^2(X, Z). To compute H^2(X, Z), we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic χ(X) is equal to the alternating sum of the Betti numbers. Since X is a complex projective variety of dimension 3, we have χ(X) = b_0(X) - b_1(X) + b_2(X) - b_3(X). We know b_0(X) = 1, b_1(X) = 5, and b_3(X) = 0 (since X is a complex projective variety, its odd-dimensional cohomology groups vanish). Therefore, χ(X) = 1 - 5 + b_2(X) = b_2(X) - 4. We also know that χ(X) = 2(2 - h^1(X, O_X) + h^2(X, O_X)), where h^i(X, O_X) are the Hodge numbers. Since h^1(X, O_X) = b_1(X)/2 = 5/2, we have χ(X) = 2(2 - 5/2 + h^2(X, O_X)) = 4 - 5 + 2h^2(X, O_X). Equating the two expressions for χ(X), we get b_2(X) - 4 = 4 - 5 + 2h^2(X, O_X), which implies b_2(X) = 2h^2(X, O_X) + 3. Thus, H^2(X, Z) ≅ Z^(2h^2(X, O_X) + 3), and so H^2(Y, Z) ≅ Z^(2h^2(X, O_X) + 3).\n\n4. H^3(Y, Z) is a subgroup of H^3(X, Z). Since H^3(X, Z) = 0, we have H^3(Y, Z) = 0.\n\nIn summary, the intersection cohomology groups of Y are:\n\n- H^0(Y, Z) ≅ Z\n- H^1(Y, Z) ≅ Z^5\n- H^2(Y, Z) ≅ Z^(2h^2(X, O_X) + 3)\n- H^3(Y, Z) = 0"
