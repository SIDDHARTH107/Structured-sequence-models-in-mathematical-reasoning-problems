    "message_1": "Suppose that a company's network is vulnerable to three different types of cyber attacks A, B, and C. The probability of a successful A-attack on the network is 0.08, the probability of a successful B-attack is 0.04, and the probability of a successful C-attack is 0.02. What is the probability that at least one of these types of cyber attacks will be successful on the network?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one of these types of cyber attacks will be successful, we can use the complementary probability rule. The complementary probability rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nLet's first find the probability of each type of attack not being successful:\n- For A-attack: 1 - 0.08 = 0.92\n- For B-attack: 1 - 0.04 = 0.96\n- For C-attack: 1 - 0.02 = 0.98\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that none of the attacks are successful. Since the attacks are independent events, we can multiply their probabilities of not being successful together:\n0.92 * 0.96 * 0.98 = 0.863232\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that at least one attack is successful by subtracting the probability of none being successful from 1:\n1 - 0.863232 = 0.136768\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of these types of cyber attacks will be successful on the network is approximately 0.136768 or 13.68%."
