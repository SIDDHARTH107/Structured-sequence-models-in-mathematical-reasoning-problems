    "message_1": "A car rental company charges a fixed cost of $50 and a per-mile cost of $0.25 for rentals up to 100 miles. For longer rentals, say up to 250 miles, the fixed cost remains the same but the per-mile cost drops to $0.20. What is the optimal rental distance for a customer if they want to minimize their rental cost?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the rental cost, we need to find the point at which the cost per mile changes from $0.25 to $0.20. We will calculate the total cost for both scenarios and compare them.\n\nScenario 1: Rentals up to 100 miles\nTotal cost = Fixed cost + (Per-mile cost * Number of miles)\nTotal cost = $50 + ($0.25 * Number of miles)\n\nScenario 2: Rentals up to 250 miles\nTotal cost = Fixed cost + (Per-mile cost * Number of miles)\nTotal cost = $50 + ($0.20 * Number of miles)\n\nNow, we will find the point at which the total cost for both scenarios is the same.\n\n$50 + ($0.25 * Number of miles) = $50 + ($0.20 * Number of miles)\n\nSolving for the number of miles:\n\n$0.25 * Number of miles = $0.20 * Number of miles + $0\n\n$0.05 * Number of miles = $0\n\nNumber of miles = 100\n\nSo, the optimal rental distance for a customer to minimize their rental cost is 100 miles. At this point, the cost per mile changes from $0.25 to $0.20, and the total cost would be:\n\nTotal cost = $50 + ($0.25 * 100) = $50 + $25 = $75"
