    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum of a function. In this case, we want to minimize the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 5.\n\nTo implement the WOA, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of whales with random positions in the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale.\n3. Update the position of each whale using the WOA equations.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the maximum number of iterations (100 in this case).\n5. Find the whale with the best fitness (minimum value of f(x)).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the WOA is a complex algorithm that requires a significant amount of code to implement. As an AI language model, I cannot execute code or perform iterative calculations. \n\nThat being said, we can find the minimum value of the given function analytically using calculus. The minimum value of a quadratic function can be found by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 4 = 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 2\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of f(x) by plugging in x = 2:\n\nf(2) = (2)^2 - 4(2) + 5 = 4 - 8 + 5 = 1\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) is 1, and it occurs at x = 2. While this doesn't use the Whale Optimization Algorithm, it provides an exact solution to the problem."
