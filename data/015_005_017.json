    "message_2": "The maximum Lyapunov exponent of a dynamical system, such as the Rössler system, is a measure of the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. It is a numerical value that can be calculated using various numerical methods, such as the Wolf algorithm or the Rosenstein algorithm.\n\nThe Rössler system is a system of three ordinary differential equations, given by:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are parameters.\n\nFor the given parameters a=0.1, b=0.1, and c=14, the maximum Lyapunov exponent can be calculated using numerical methods. However, as an AI language model, I am unable to perform such numerical calculations directly. You can use software tools like MATLAB or Python libraries like NumPy and SciPy to perform these calculations."
