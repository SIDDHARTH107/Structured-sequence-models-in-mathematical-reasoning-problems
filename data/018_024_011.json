    "message_2": "(i) A ∆ B\nThe symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∆ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, A ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\n(ii) A' ∆ B'\nTo find the complements of A and B, we need to know the universal set U. Since it is not given, let's assume U contains all the elements in A and B.\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nA' = U - A = {4}\nB' = U - B = {1}\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B') = ({1, 4}) - {} = {1, 4}\n\n(iii) (A ∆ B)' and A' ∆ B'\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1, 4} = {2, 3}\n\nNow, we compare (A ∆ B)' and A' ∆ B':\n\n(A ∆ B)' = {2, 3}\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 4}\n\nSince (A ∆ B)' ≠ A' ∆ B', we can conclude that the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
