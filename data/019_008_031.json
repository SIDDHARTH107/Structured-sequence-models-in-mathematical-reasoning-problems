    "message_2": "To find the degree of membership for the number 8, we can use linear interpolation between the given membership values for 7 and 9.\n\nμ(8) = μ(7) + (8 - 7) * (μ(9) - μ(7)) / (9 - 7)\n\nμ(8) = 0.8 + (1) * (0.5 - 0.8) / (2)\n\nμ(8) = 0.8 + (-0.3) / 2\n\nμ(8) = 0.8 - 0.15\n\nμ(8) = 0.65\n\nSo, the degree of membership for the number 8 in the fuzzy set is 0.65."
