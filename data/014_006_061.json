    "message_1": "Assume that you are using a one-time pad encryption technique to encrypt a message using a secret key of length 20, where each character in the key is randomly generated from the set of capital letters and digits. If the message contains exactly 1000 characters, how many possible keys can be used to encrypt the message?",
    "message_2": "In a one-time pad encryption technique, the key is as long as the message. However, in this case, the key is of length 20, and the message is of length 1000. This means that the key is repeated 50 times to match the length of the message (1000 / 20 = 50).\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible characters in the key. There are 26 capital letters and 10 digits, so there are a total of 26 + 10 = 36 possible characters for each position in the key.\n\nSince the key has 20 characters, the total number of possible keys is 36^20, which is approximately 1.99 x 10^31 different keys."
