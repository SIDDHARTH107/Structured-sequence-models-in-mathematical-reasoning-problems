    "message_2": "To find the probability of picking a red ball from the jar, we need to divide the number of red balls by the total number of balls in the jar.\n\nThere are 5 red balls and 10 blue balls, so the total number of balls in the jar is 5 + 10 = 15.\n\nThe probability of picking a red ball is therefore 5 (red balls) divided by 15 (total balls):\n\nProbability = 5/15\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nProbability = 1/3\n\nSo the probability of picking a red ball from the jar is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 (rounded to four decimal places)."
