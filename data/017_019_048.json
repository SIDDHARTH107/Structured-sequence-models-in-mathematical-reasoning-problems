    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which must be normal. If n_2 = 9, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and we cannot guarantee that any of them are normal.\n\nNext, let's consider the Sylow 3-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which must be normal. If n_3 = 4, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and we cannot guarantee that any of them are normal.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, both the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup are normal. The group is a direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. Since the orders of the subgroups are coprime, the group is isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_9, which is isomorphic to Z_36.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, but the Sylow 3-subgroup is not. The group is a semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. There are two possibilities for the Sylow 3-subgroup: Z_9 or Z_3 × Z_3. However, since the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, the group must be isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_3.\n\n3. n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1: In this case, the Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal, but the Sylow 3-subgroup is. The group is a semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. There are two possibilities for the Sylow 2-subgroup: Z_4 or Z_2 × Z_2. The group must be isomorphic to either Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_9 or Z_4 × Z_9. However, the first case is isomorphic to the second case in (2), so there is only one new group, which is Z_4 × Z_9.\n\n4. n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4: In this case, neither the Sylow 2-subgroup nor the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal. There are no new groups in this case.\n\nIn summary, there are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36:\n\n1. Z_36\n2. Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_3\n3. Z_4 × Z_9"
