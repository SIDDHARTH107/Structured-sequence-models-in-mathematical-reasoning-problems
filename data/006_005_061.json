    "message_1": "Suppose that a manufacturing company experiences product defects at an average rate of 2 units per hour. What is the probability of having exactly 4 defects in the next 3 hours of operation?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson probability distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, product defects) occurring in a fixed interval of time (3 hours in this case) given a known average rate (2 defects per hour).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * (λ^k)) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (defects) in the given time interval\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of events (defects) per time interval, which is equal to the average rate (2 defects per hour) multiplied by the length of the time interval (3 hours)\n- k is the number of events (defects) we want to find the probability for (4 defects in this case)\n- k! is the factorial of k (the product of all positive integers up to k)\n\nFirst, we need to find the value of λ:\n\nλ = average rate * time interval = 2 defects/hour * 3 hours = 6 defects\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Poisson distribution formula to find the probability of having exactly 4 defects in the next 3 hours:\n\nP(X = 4) = (e^(-6) * (6^4)) / 4!\nP(X = 4) = (2.71828^(-6) * (6^4)) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\nP(X = 4) ≈ (0.002478 * 1296) / 24\nP(X = 4) ≈ 3.2106 / 24\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.133775\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 4 defects in the next 3 hours of operation is approximately 0.1338 or 13.38%."
