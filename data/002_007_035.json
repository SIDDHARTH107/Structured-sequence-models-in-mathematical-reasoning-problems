    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm and its parallel sides measure 10 cm and 14 cm in length. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (sum of parallel sides) × height\n\nIn this case, the parallel sides are 10 cm and 14 cm, and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) × (10 + 14) × 8\nArea = (1/2) × 24 × 8\nArea = 12 × 8\nArea = 96 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 96 square centimeters."
