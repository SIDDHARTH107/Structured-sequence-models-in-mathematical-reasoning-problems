    "message_2": "To find a complex valued function $f(y)$ that satisfies the given integral equation, let's first rewrite the integral equation as follows:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x^2}{1-xy}f(y)dy = \\int_{0}^{1} x^2 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (xy)^n f(y) dy = 1 + x$$\n\nNow, we can interchange the order of summation and integration:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^2 \\int_{0}^{1} (xy)^n f(y) dy = 1 + x$$\n\nWe can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as a power series in $x$:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x^{2+n} \\int_{0}^{1} y^n f(y) dy = 1 + x$$\n\nNow, we want to find a function $f(y)$ such that the power series on the left-hand side matches the right-hand side. To do this, we can equate the coefficients of the powers of $x$ on both sides of the equation. \n\nFor the constant term, we have:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} f(y) dy = 1$$\n\nFor the linear term, we have:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} y f(y) dy = 1$$\n\nFor the higher-order terms, we have:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} y^n f(y) dy = 0, \\quad n \\geq 2$$\n\nNow, let's consider the function $f(y) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y(1-y)}}$. This function is complex valued, as it involves the square root of $y(1-y)$. Let's check if this function satisfies the above conditions.\n\nFor the constant term:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y(1-y)}} dy = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\pi} d(\\arcsin(2y-1)) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} [\\arcsin(2y-1)]_{0}^{1} = 1$$\n\nFor the linear term:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} y \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y(1-y)}} dy = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1}{\\pi} d(\\sqrt{y(1-y)}) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} [\\sqrt{y(1-y)}]_{0}^{1} = 1$$\n\nFor the higher-order terms, we can use the orthogonality property of the Legendre polynomials. The function $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y(1-y)}}$ is proportional to the weight function for the Legendre polynomials, and the integral of the product of two different Legendre polynomials with this weight function is zero. Since $y^n$ for $n \\geq 2$ can be expressed as a linear combination of Legendre polynomials of order $2$ or higher, the higher-order terms will be zero.\n\nThus, the complex valued function $f(y) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y(1-y)}}$ satisfies the given integral equation."
