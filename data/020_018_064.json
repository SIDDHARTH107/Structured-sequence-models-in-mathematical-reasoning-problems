What is the expected value of the game for player 2?",
    "message_2": "(a) To find the optimal strategy for player 1, we will use the concept of security levels. The security level for each strategy of player 1 is the minimum payoff they can guarantee by playing that strategy. For strategy U, the security level is min(2, -1, 7) = -1. For strategy D, the security level is min(-5, 3, -2) = -5. Player 1 will choose the strategy with the highest security level, which is strategy U with a security level of -1. Therefore, the optimal strategy for player 1 is to play U, and the maximum value of the game is -1.\n\n(b) Now, suppose player 1 chooses the optimal strategy (U) and player 2 plays a mixed strategy with probabilities p(L) = 1/3, p(M) = 1/3, and p(R) = 1/3. The expected value of the game for player 2 can be calculated as follows:\n\nE(Player 2) = p(L) * (Payoff when Player 1 plays U and Player 2 plays L) + p(M) * (Payoff when Player 1 plays U and Player 2 plays M) + p(R) * (Payoff when Player 1 plays U and Player 2 plays R)\n\nE(Player 2) = (1/3) * (-2) + (1/3) * (1) + (1/3) * (-7)\n\nE(Player 2) = -2/3 + 1/3 - 7/3 = -8/3\n\nSo, the expected value of the game for player 2 is -8/3 when player 1 chooses the optimal strategy and player 2 plays the given mixed strategy."
