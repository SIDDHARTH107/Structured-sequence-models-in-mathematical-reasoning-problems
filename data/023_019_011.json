    "message_1": "Consider the system with transfer function H(s)= (10s+20)/(s^2+6s+25). Determine if the system is stable or not by finding its Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system, we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function H(s). The poles are the roots of the denominator of the transfer function. In this case, the denominator is given by:\n\ns^2 + 6s + 25\n\nTo find the roots, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\ns = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = 6, and c = 25. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\ns = (-6 ± √(6^2 - 4 * 1 * 25)) / 2 * 1\ns = (-6 ± √(36 - 100)) / 2\ns = (-6 ± √(-64)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, the roots are complex conjugates:\n\ns = -3 ± 4j\n\nNow, to determine the stability of the system, we need to check the real part of the poles. If the real part of all poles is negative, the system is stable. In this case, the real part of both poles is -3, which is negative. Therefore, the system is stable.\n\nNote that finding the Fourier transform is not necessary to determine the stability of the system. The stability can be determined by analyzing the poles of the transfer function, as shown above."
