    "message_2": "To determine the most commonly occurring English letter in a given text message containing 1000 characters, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a frequency table to count the occurrences of each English letter (A-Z) in the text message. You can ignore case by converting all letters to uppercase or lowercase.\n\n2. Iterate through the text message, character by character, and for each English letter, increment its count in the frequency table.\n\n3. After iterating through all 1000 characters, find the letter with the highest count in the frequency table. This letter is the most commonly occurring English letter in the text message.\n\nPlease provide the text message to analyze, and I will perform the frequency analysis and determine the most commonly occurring English letter."
