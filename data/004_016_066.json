    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Mean Value Theorem for integrals, which states that if a function is continuous on the interval [a, b], then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that:\n\nf(b) - f(a) = f'(c) * (b - a)\n\nIn this case, we are given that the car traveled 128 miles between 9:00am and 12:00 noon. Let's denote the position function of the car as s(t), where t is the time in hours since 9:00am. We are given that s(0) = 0 and s(3) = 128. We want to find the time t when the car is exactly halfway between the starting point and ending point, i.e., when s(t) = 64.\n\nSince the car traveled 128 miles in 3 hours, the average speed of the car is:\n\naverage speed = (128 miles) / (3 hours) = 42.67 miles/hour\n\nNow, we will apply the Mean Value Theorem for integrals. Let v(t) be the velocity function of the car, which is the derivative of the position function s(t). Then, we have:\n\ns(3) - s(0) = ∫[0, 3] v(t) dt = v(c) * (3 - 0)\n\n128 - 0 = v(c) * 3\n\nSince the average speed of the car is 42.67 miles/hour, we can assume that there exists a time c when the car's instantaneous speed is also 42.67 miles/hour. Therefore, we have:\n\n128 = 42.67 * 3\n\nNow, we want to find the time t when the car is exactly halfway between the starting point and ending point, i.e., when s(t) = 64. Since the car's speed is continuous, we can assume that there exists a time t when the car's instantaneous speed is also 42.67 miles/hour. Therefore, we have:\n\n64 = 42.67 * t\n\nt = 64 / 42.67 ≈ 1.5\n\nSo, the car was exactly halfway between the starting point and ending point at t = 1.5 hours since 9:00am, which is 10:30am."
