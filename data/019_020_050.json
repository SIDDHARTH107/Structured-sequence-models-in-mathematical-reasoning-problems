    "message_2": "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an NP-hard problem, meaning there is no known algorithm to solve it efficiently for all cases. However, for a graph with 10 cities, we can use the brute force approach to find the minimum number of steps required to solve the problem.\n\nIn the brute force approach, we consider all possible permutations of the cities and calculate the total distance for each permutation. Since there are 10 cities, there are 10! (10 factorial) permutations. However, since the problem is symmetric (i.e., the starting city doesn't matter), we can divide the number of permutations by 10, which gives us (10-1)! = 9! = 362,880 permutations.\n\nSo, the minimum number of steps required to solve the TSP for a graph with 10 cities using the brute force approach is 362,880 steps."
