    "message_2": "A complete graph K6 has 6 vertices, and each vertex is connected to every other vertex. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.\n\nOne possible Hamiltonian cycle in K6 can be represented by the following sequence of vertices:\n\n1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 1\n\nThis cycle starts at vertex 1, visits all other vertices (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) in order, and returns to vertex 1. Since K6 is a complete graph, all these vertices are connected, and this sequence forms a valid Hamiltonian cycle."
