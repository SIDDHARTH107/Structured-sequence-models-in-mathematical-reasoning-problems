    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the third equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2. This means that the third equation does not provide any new information, and we can ignore it. We are left with the following system of equations:\n\nx + 2y - z = 5\n3x - 6y + 3z = 9\n\nNow, let's solve this system of equations. We can eliminate one of the variables by multiplying the first equation by 3 and then adding the two equations together:\n\n(3)(x + 2y - z) = (3)5\n3x + 6y - 3z = 15\n\nNow add the second equation to the modified first equation:\n\n(3x + 6y - 3z) + (3x - 6y + 3z) = 15 + 9\n6x = 24\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 24 / 6\nx = 4\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y and z. Let's use the first equation:\n\n4 + 2y - z = 5\n\nNow, let's solve for y:\n\n2y - z = 1\n\nWe still need another equation to solve for y and z. Let's use the second equation and substitute the value of x:\n\n3(4) - 6y + 3z = 9\n12 - 6y + 3z = 9\n\nNow, let's solve for y and z using the two equations we have:\n\n2y - z = 1\n-6y + 3z = -3\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by 3 to match the coefficients of y in both equations:\n\n(3)(2y - z) = (3)1\n6y - 3z = 3\n\nNow add the second equation to the modified first equation:\n\n(6y - 3z) + (-6y + 3z) = 3 + (-3)\n0 = 0\n\nSince we ended up with 0 = 0, it means that the two equations are dependent, and there are infinitely many solutions for y and z that would satisfy the system. So, we cannot find unique values for y and z.\n\nIn conclusion, x = 4, but there are infinitely many solutions for y and z."
