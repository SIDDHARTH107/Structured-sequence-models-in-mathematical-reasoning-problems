Find the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^n(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ for $n=3,4,5$.",
    "message_2": "Given the information provided, we cannot determine the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^n(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ for $n=3,4,5$. The cohomology groups of a topological space depend on the specific structure of the space, and we do not have enough information about the space $X$ to determine the higher cohomology groups.\n\nIn general, the cohomology groups of a topological space can be quite complicated and depend on the specific structure of the space. There are some general results and techniques for computing cohomology groups, such as the Mayer-Vietoris sequence and the KÃ¼nneth formula, but these require more information about the space than what is given in the problem statement.\n\nWithout more information about the topological space $X$, it is not possible to determine the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^n(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ for $n=3,4,5$."
