    "message_1": "A company produces two types of lamps, A and B, and sells them at a profit of $4 and $5 per unit, respectively. Each type A lamp requires 2 hours of assembly time and 1 hour of painting time, while each type B lamp requires 1 hour of assembly time and 3 hours of painting time. The company has an assembly team with a total of 100 hours of available assembly time and a painting team with a total of 120 hours of available painting time. What is the maximum profit the company can make, given the available resources?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of type A lamps produced and y be the number of type B lamps produced.\n\nThe profit function is given by P(x, y) = 4x + 5y.\n\nThe constraints for the available assembly and painting time are as follows:\n\nAssembly time: 2x + y ≤ 100\nPainting time: x + 3y ≤ 120\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of P(x, y) subject to these constraints.\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\ny ≤ -2x + 100 (from the assembly time constraint)\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 40 (from the painting time constraint)\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the points of intersection of these inequalities:\n\n1. Intersection of y = -2x + 100 and y = (-1/3)x + 40:\n\n-2x + 100 = (-1/3)x + 40\n(5/3)x = 60\nx = 36\n\ny = -2(36) + 100 = 28\n\nSo, the first vertex is (36, 28).\n\n2. Intersection of y = -2x + 100 and x-axis (y = 0):\n\n-2x + 100 = 0\nx = 50\n\nSo, the second vertex is (50, 0).\n\n3. Intersection of y = (-1/3)x + 40 and x-axis (y = 0):\n\n(-1/3)x + 40 = 0\nx = 120\n\nSo, the third vertex is (120, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at these vertices:\n\nP(36, 28) = 4(36) + 5(28) = 144 + 140 = 284\nP(50, 0) = 4(50) + 5(0) = 200\nP(120, 0) = 4(120) + 5(0) = 480\n\nThe maximum profit is $480 when the company produces 120 type A lamps and 0 type B lamps."
