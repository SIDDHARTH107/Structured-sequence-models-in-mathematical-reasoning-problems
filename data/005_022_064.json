    "message_2": "To calculate the median and interquartile range (IQR) of the data set, we first need to arrange the values in ascending order:\n\n6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20\n\nNow, we find the median (the middle value) of the data set. Since there are 10 values, the median will be the average of the 5th and 6th values:\n\nMedian = (12 + 13) / 2 = 25 / 2 = 12.5\n\nNext, we find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data, and Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data.\n\nLower half: 6, 7, 8, 10, 12\nUpper half: 13, 14, 15, 16, 20\n\nQ1 = Median of lower half = (8 + 10) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9\nQ3 = Median of upper half = (15 + 16) / 2 = 31 / 2 = 15.5\n\nFinally, we calculate the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 15.5 - 9 = 6.5\n\nSo, the median of the data set is 12.5, and the interquartile range (IQR) is 6.5."
