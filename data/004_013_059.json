    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 3 on the interval -2 ≤ x ≤ 4, we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 3) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\nNow, set f'(x) = 0 to find the critical points:\n\n6x^2 - 18x + 12 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 6 to simplify:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 2.\n\nNow, we need to check the value of the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval (-2 and 4) to determine the maximum and minimum values.\n\nf(-2) = 2(-2)^3 - 9(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 3 = -16 - 36 - 24 + 3 = -73\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 12(1) + 3 = 2 - 9 + 12 + 3 = 8\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 12(2) + 3 = 16 - 36 + 24 + 3 = 7\nf(4) = 2(4)^3 - 9(4)^2 + 12(4) + 3 = 128 - 144 + 48 + 3 = 35\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the maximum value is 35 at x = 4 and the minimum value is -73 at x = -2."
