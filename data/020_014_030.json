    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of products, A and B. The profit earned from selling each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from selling each unit of product B is $7. The cost of producing one unit of product A is $2, and for product B it is $3. The manufacturer has 100 units of labor available and 150 units of raw material. It takes 2 units of labor and 3 units of raw material to produce one unit of product A, and 3 units of labor and 4 units of raw material to produce one unit of product B. What is the optimal number of units of each product that the manufacturer should produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe profit for product A is $5 - $2 = $3 per unit, and the profit for product B is $7 - $3 = $4 per unit.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is P(x, y) = 3x + 4y.\n\nThe constraints are given by the available labor and raw material:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 100\n2. Raw material constraint: 3x + 4y ≤ 150\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will solve this linear programming problem graphically by plotting the feasible region and finding the vertices.\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints as equalities to find the boundary lines:\n\n1. Labor constraint: y = (100 - 2x) / 3\n2. Raw material constraint: y = (150 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow, we'll plot these lines along with the non-negativity constraints (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0) to find the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 37.5), (50, 0), and (20, 20).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function P(x, y) = 3x + 4y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 3(0) + 4(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 37.5) = 3(0) + 4(37.5) = 150\n3. P(50, 0) = 3(50) + 4(0) = 150\n4. P(20, 20) = 3(20) + 4(20) = 140\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertices (0, 37.5) and (50, 0), both yielding a profit of $150. The manufacturer can either produce 37.5 units of product B (and no units of product A) or 50 units of product A (and no units of product B) to maximize their profit. However, since the manufacturer cannot produce a fraction of a unit, they should choose to produce 50 units of product A to maximize their profit."
