    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve. The perimeter of a Hilbert curve increases with each order. For each order, the number of segments in the curve is 4^n, where n is the order of the curve.\n\nIn this case, the order of the Hilbert curve is 4. So, the number of segments in the curve is 4^4 = 256.\n\nSince each segment of the curve has a length of 1, the total perimeter of the 4th order Hilbert curve is 256 * 1 = 256."
