    "message_2": "To find the maximum possible value of |f'(0)|, we can use the Cauchy's inequality. For an entire function f(z) and a circle with radius R centered at the origin, the inequality states that:\n\n|f^(n)(0)| ≤ (n! * M) / R^n\n\nwhere f^(n)(0) is the nth derivative of f at 0, M is the maximum value of |f(z)| on the circle, and R is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn our case, n = 1 (since we want the first derivative), and M = 3 (since |f(z)| ≤ 3 for all z in the complex plane). We want to find the maximum possible value of |f'(0)|, so we need to minimize the right-hand side of the inequality.\n\nAs R increases, the value of R^n also increases, which in turn decreases the value of the right-hand side of the inequality. Since f(z) is entire, it is defined and bounded for all z in the complex plane, so we can let R approach infinity.\n\nAs R → ∞, the right-hand side of the inequality approaches 0. Therefore, the maximum possible value of |f'(0)| is 0. This is in accordance with the maximum modulus principle, which states that if an entire function is bounded, it must be constant. In this case, f(z) is a constant function, and its derivative is 0."
