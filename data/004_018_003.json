    "message_2": "The power rule of differentiation states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 5x^4, so n = 4. Applying the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 4 * 5x^(4-1)\nf'(x) = 20x^3\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^4 is f'(x) = 20x^3."
