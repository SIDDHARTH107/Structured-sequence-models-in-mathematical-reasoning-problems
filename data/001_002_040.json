    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through two points, we first need to find the slope (m) of the line. The slope can be found using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\nUsing the given points (-3, 4) and (1, -2), we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nm = (-2 - 4) / (1 - (-3))\nm = (-6) / (4)\nm = -3/2\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nPlugging in the slope and one of the points, let's use (-3, 4):\n\ny - 4 = -3/2(x - (-3))\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation and convert it to slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\ny - 4 = -3/2(x + 3)\ny - 4 = -3/2x - 9/2\n\nTo isolate y, add 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\ny = -3/2x - 9/2 + 4\n\nTo add 4 to -9/2, we need to convert 4 to a fraction with the same denominator:\n\n4 = 8/2\n\nNow, we can add the fractions:\n\ny = -3/2x - 9/2 + 8/2\ny = -3/2x - 1/2\n\nSo, the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is:\n\ny = -3/2x - 1/2"
