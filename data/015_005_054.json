    "message_2": "The Rössler system is a system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations, which is defined as follows:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x-c)\n\nTo find the value of the y-coordinate when x = 0, we need to find the equilibrium points of the system. The equilibrium points are the points where the derivatives dx/dt, dy/dt, and dz/dt are all equal to 0. Let's find these points:\n\n1. dx/dt = -y - z = 0\n2. dy/dt = x + ay = 0\n3. dz/dt = b + z(x-c) = 0\n\nNow, we are given that x = 0, and we have the parameters a = 0.1, b = 0.1, and c = 14. Let's plug these values into the equations:\n\n1. -y - z = 0\n2. 0 + 0.1y = 0\n3. 0.1 + z(0-14) = 0\n\nFrom equation 2, we can see that y = 0. Now, let's plug this value into equation 1:\n\n-z = 0 => z = 0\n\nNow, we have the equilibrium point (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0). Therefore, the value of the y-coordinate when x = 0 for the Rössler system with the given parameters is y = 0."
