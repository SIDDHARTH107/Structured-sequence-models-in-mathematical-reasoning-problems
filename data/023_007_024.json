    "message_1": "Consider a periodic signal `f(t)` with a period of 2π such that f(t) = sin(2t) + 3cos(5t). Find the Fourier transform of the signal and determine the frequencies and their respective amplitudes present in the signal.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given signal, we first need to express the signal in terms of complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\nsin(2t) = (e^(j2t) - e^(-j2t)) / (2j)\n3cos(5t) = (3/2)(e^(j5t) + e^(-j5t))\n\nNow, the signal f(t) can be written as:\n\nf(t) = (1/2j)(e^(j2t) - e^(-j2t)) + (3/2)(e^(j5t) + e^(-j5t))\n\nThe Fourier transform of f(t) can be found by taking the continuous Fourier transform of each term:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t)e^(-jωt)dt] from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince the signal is periodic, we can use the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(t) = Σ[C_n * e^(jnω₀t)]\n\nwhere ω₀ = 2π/T, T is the period, and C_n are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nComparing the given signal with the Fourier series representation, we can identify the Fourier coefficients:\n\nC_2 = 1/2j\nC_-2 = -1/2j\nC_5 = 3/2\nC_-5 = 3/2\n\nAll other coefficients C_n are zero.\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier transform F(ω) as a sum of Dirac delta functions:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2j)(δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)) + (3/2)(δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5))\n\nThe frequencies present in the signal are:\n\nω1 = 2 (from sin(2t))\nω2 = 5 (from 3cos(5t))\n\nThe respective amplitudes are:\n\nA1 = 1/2 (from sin(2t))\nA2 = 3/2 (from 3cos(5t))\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the signal f(t) = sin(2t) + 3cos(5t) is:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2j)(δ(ω - 2) - δ(ω + 2)) + (3/2)(δ(ω - 5) + δ(ω + 5))\n\nAnd the frequencies present in the signal are 2 and 5 with respective amplitudes 1/2 and 3/2."
