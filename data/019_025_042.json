    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturing company produces 2000 units of a product each day. Last week, the company noticed that their output decreased to 1500 units per day. In order to investigate the problem, they implemented a new production technique. If the new production technique is effective, by how much percentage should the output increase in order to bring the units produced per day back to 2000?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage increase needed to bring the output back to 2000 units per day, we first need to determine the difference between the current output (1500 units) and the desired output (2000 units).\n\nThe difference is: 2000 - 1500 = 500 units\n\nNow, we need to find what percentage of the current output (1500 units) this difference represents. To do this, we will divide the difference (500 units) by the current output (1500 units) and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nPercentage increase = (500 / 1500) * 100 = 0.3333 * 100 = 33.33%\n\nSo, the output needs to increase by 33.33% to bring the units produced per day back to 2000."
