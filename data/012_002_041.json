    "message_2": "The chromatic number of a complete graph K_n is equal to n if n is odd and n-1 if n is even. Since K6 is a complete graph with 6 vertices (an even number), its chromatic number is 6 - 1 = 5. However, you are asked to color the vertices using only 4 different colors, which is less than the chromatic number.\n\nTo color the vertices of K6 using 4 different colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, we can use the following combinatorial approach:\n\n1. Choose a color for the first vertex. There are 4 options.\n2. Choose a color for the second vertex. Since it cannot be the same as the first vertex, there are 3 options.\n3. Choose a color for the third vertex. It cannot be the same as the second vertex, so there are 3 options.\n4. Choose a color for the fourth vertex. It cannot be the same as the third vertex, so there are 3 options.\n5. For the fifth vertex, we have a problem. It is adjacent to all the previous vertices, and since we have used all 4 colors, it is impossible to choose a color for the fifth vertex that is not the same as any of its neighbors.\n6. The same issue occurs for the sixth vertex.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to color the vertices of K6 using only 4 different colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color."
