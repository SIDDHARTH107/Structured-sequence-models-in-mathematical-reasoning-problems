Finally, find the corresponding optimal state trajectories $x(t)$ and $y(t)$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using optimal control theory, we first need to rewrite the given system of differential equations in the form of a control system. Let's introduce the control function $u(t)$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 3x + y + u(t), \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = x + 2y\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the Hamiltonian function $H(x, y, p_x, p_y, u)$, where $p_x$ and $p_y$ are the costate variables. The Hamiltonian is given by:\n\n$$\nH(x, y, p_x, p_y, u) = p_x(3x + y + u) + p_y(x + 2y) + u^2\n$$\n\nNext, we need to find the optimal control $u^*(t)$ that minimizes the Hamiltonian. To do this, we take the partial derivative of $H$ with respect to $u$ and set it equal to zero:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u} = 2u + p_x = 0\n$$\n\nSolving for $u^*(t)$, we get:\n\n$$\nu^*(t) = -\\frac{1}{2}p_x(t)\n$$\n\nHowever, we need to take into account the constraint $|u(t)| \\leq 1$. Therefore, the optimal control function is given by:\n\n$$\nu^*(t) = \\begin{cases}\n-1, & \\text{if } -\\frac{1}{2}p_x(t) < -1 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2}p_x(t), & \\text{if } -1 \\leq -\\frac{1}{2}p_x(t) \\leq 1 \\\\\n1, & \\text{if } -\\frac{1}{2}p_x(t) > 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equations. These are given by the negative partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian with respect to the state variables:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dp_x}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = -3p_x - p_y\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{dp_y}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = -p_x - 4p_y\n$$\n\nWe have a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) with the following system of differential equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = 3x + y + u^*(t), \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = x + 2y, \\quad \\frac{dp_x}{dt} = -3p_x - p_y, \\quad \\frac{dp_y}{dt} = -p_x - 4p_y\n$$\n\nwith boundary conditions $x(0) = 1$, $y(0) = 0$, and free final costate variables $p_x(2)$ and $p_y(2)$.\n\nTo solve this TPBVP, we can use numerical methods such as the shooting method or the finite difference method. Once we have the numerical solution for the state and costate variables, we can find the optimal control function $u^*(t)$ and the corresponding optimal state trajectories $x(t)$ and $y(t)$."
