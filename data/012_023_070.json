    "message_2": "A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest clique in the graph.\n\nIn a complete graph with n vertices, there are n(n-1)/2 edges. To find the maximum clique number for a graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges, we can compare it to the complete graph with 6 vertices, which is K_6.\n\nFor K_6, there are 6(6-1)/2 = 6(5)/2 = 30/2 = 15 edges. Since our graph has 9 edges, it is not a complete graph, and its clique number will be less than 6.\n\nNow let's consider a complete graph with 5 vertices, which is K_5. For K_5, there are 5(5-1)/2 = 5(4)/2 = 20/2 = 10 edges. Since our graph has 9 edges, it is possible to have a clique of size 5.\n\nTherefore, the clique number of the given graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges is 5."
