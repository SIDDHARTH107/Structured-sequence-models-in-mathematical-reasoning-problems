    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using Fourier Transform, we first need to take the Fourier Transform of both sides of the equation. Let Y(ω) be the Fourier Transform of y(t), and let F{·} denote the Fourier Transform operator. The given differential equation is:\n\ny''(t) + 4y(t) = 10sin(2t)\n\nTaking the Fourier Transform of both sides, we get:\n\nF{y''(t)} + 4F{y(t)} = 10F{sin(2t)}\n\nUsing the properties of Fourier Transform, we know that F{y''(t)} = (iω)^2Y(ω) = -ω^2Y(ω). Also, F{y(t)} = Y(ω) and F{sin(2t)} = i√(π/2) (δ(ω-2) - δ(ω+2)), where δ(·) is the Dirac delta function. Substituting these into the equation, we get:\n\n-ω^2Y(ω) + 4Y(ω) = 10i√(π/2) (δ(ω-2) - δ(ω+2))\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = 10i√(π/2) (δ(ω-2) - δ(ω+2)) / (4 - ω^2)\n\nTo find y(t), we need to take the inverse Fourier Transform of Y(ω). Using the convolution theorem and the inverse Fourier Transform of the Dirac delta function, we get:\n\ny(t) = (5/2)√(π/2) [e^(2it) * u(t) - e^(-2it) * u(t)]\n\nwhere u(t) is the unit step function. However, this is the particular solution of the given differential equation. To find the general solution, we need to consider the homogeneous equation:\n\ny''(t) + 4y(t) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nwhich has complex roots r = ±2i. Therefore, the general solution of the homogeneous equation is:\n\ny_h(t) = C1*cos(2t) + C2*sin(2t)\n\nNow, we need to apply the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0 to find the constants C1 and C2. For y(0) = 1, we have:\n\ny_h(0) = C1*cos(0) + C2*sin(0) = C1\n\nSo, C1 = 1.\n\nFor y'(0) = 0, we first find the derivative of y_h(t):\n\ny'_h(t) = -2C1*sin(2t) + 2C2*cos(2t)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition y'(0) = 0:\n\ny'_h(0) = -2C1*sin(0) + 2C2*cos(0) = 2C2\n\nSo, C2 = 0.\n\nThus, the general solution of the given differential equation is:\n\ny(t) = y_h(t) + y_p(t) = cos(2t) + (5/2)√(π/2) [e^(2it) * u(t) - e^(-2it) * u(t)]"
