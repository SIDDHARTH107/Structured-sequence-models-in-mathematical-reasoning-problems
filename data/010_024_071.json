    "message_2": "To find the side length of a regular hyperbolic heptagon with a circumradius of 2, we can use the formula for the side length of a regular hyperbolic polygon:\n\ns = 2 * R * arcsinh(tan(π/n))\n\nwhere s is the side length, R is the circumradius, n is the number of sides, and arcsinh is the inverse hyperbolic sine function.\n\nIn this case, R = 2 and n = 7:\n\ns = 2 * 2 * arcsinh(tan(π/7))\ns = 4 * arcsinh(tan(π/7))\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the value of arcsinh(tan(π/7)):\n\narcsinh(tan(π/7)) ≈ 0.3617\n\nFinally, multiply this value by 4 to find the side length:\n\ns ≈ 4 * 0.3617\ns ≈ 1.4468\n\nSo, the side length of the regular hyperbolic heptagon with a circumradius of 2 is approximately 1.4468."
