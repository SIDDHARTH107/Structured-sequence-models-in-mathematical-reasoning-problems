    "message_2": "To prove that if n is an odd integer, then $n^2$ is also odd, we can use the definition of odd integers.\n\nAn odd integer can be represented as $n = 2k + 1$, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, let's find the square of n:\n\n$n^2 = (2k + 1)^2$\n\nExpanding the expression, we get:\n\n$n^2 = (2k)^2 + 2(2k)(1) + 1^2$\n\n$n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1$\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the first two terms:\n\n$n^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$\n\nLet $m = 2k^2 + 2k$. Since k is an integer, m is also an integer.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$n^2 = 2m + 1$\n\nSince $n^2$ can be represented in the form of $2m + 1$, where m is an integer, we can conclude that $n^2$ is also an odd integer."
