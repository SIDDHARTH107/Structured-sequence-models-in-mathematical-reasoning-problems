    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem on robust optimization:\n\nSuppose there are three production lines in a factory, each producing a certain product. The hourly production rates for the three lines are uncertain and may vary within the following ranges:\n\n- Line 1: 1000 to 1100 units per hour\n- Line 2: 900 to 1000 units per hour\n- Line 3: 1200 to 1300 units per hour\n\nThe factory has a customer order of 3000 units that needs to be fulfilled in the next 3 hours. What is the minimum number of units that the factory needs to produce per hour on each line in order to ensure that the customer order is fulfilled with at least 95% probability, given the uncertainties in the production rates?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum production rate for each line that will ensure a 95% probability of fulfilling the customer order of 3000 units in 3 hours. \n\nLet x1, x2, and x3 be the minimum hourly production rates for Line 1, Line 2, and Line 3, respectively. We need to find x1, x2, and x3 such that:\n\nP(x1 + x2 + x3 >= 1000) >= 0.95\n\nSince the production rates are uncertain and vary within a range, we can assume a uniform distribution for each line. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a uniform distribution is given by:\n\nCDF(x) = (x - a) / (b - a)\n\nwhere a and b are the lower and upper bounds of the range, respectively.\n\nWe can write the CDF for each line as:\n\nCDF1(x1) = (x1 - 1000) / (1100 - 1000)\nCDF2(x2) = (x2 - 900) / (1000 - 900)\nCDF3(x3) = (x3 - 1200) / (1300 - 1200)\n\nSince the production lines are independent, we can multiply their CDFs to find the joint CDF:\n\nJoint_CDF(x1, x2, x3) = CDF1(x1) * CDF2(x2) * CDF3(x3)\n\nWe want to find x1, x2, and x3 such that the joint CDF is at least 0.95:\n\n0.95 <= Joint_CDF(x1, x2, x3)\n\nSubstituting the individual CDFs:\n\n0.95 <= ((x1 - 1000) / 100) * ((x2 - 900) / 100) * ((x3 - 1200) / 100)\n\nSolving for x1, x2, and x3, we get:\n\nx1 >= 1070\nx2 >= 970\nx3 >= 1270\n\nSo, to ensure a 95% probability of fulfilling the customer order, the factory needs to produce at least 1070 units per hour on Line 1, 970 units per hour on Line 2, and 1270 units per hour on Line 3."
