    "message_2": "To find the image of the circle |z - 1/2| = 1/2 under the conformal mapping f(z) = z^3 - 3z^2 + 2z, we need to evaluate f(1/2 + e^(it)) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π.\n\nLet z = 1/2 + e^(it). Then, we can write z as:\n\nz = 1/2 + (cos(t) + i*sin(t))\n\nNow, we can plug this into the function f(z):\n\nf(z) = (1/2 + cos(t) + i*sin(t))^3 - 3(1/2 + cos(t) + i*sin(t))^2 + 2(1/2 + cos(t) + i*sin(t))\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can use the binomial theorem and the trigonometric identities:\n\ncos(3t) = 4cos^3(t) - 3cos(t)\nsin(3t) = 3sin(t) - 4sin^3(t)\n\nAfter simplifying, we get:\n\nf(z) = (1/8 - 3/4 + 1) + (3/2 - 2)cos(t) + 2sin(t) + i(3/2sin(t) - 2sin^2(t)cos(t))\n\nNow, we have the image of the circle under the conformal mapping f(z) as a parametric equation in terms of t:\n\nf(1/2 + e^(it)) = (1/8 - 3/4 + 1) + (3/2 - 2)cos(t) + 2sin(t) + i(3/2sin(t) - 2sin^2(t)cos(t)), for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π."
