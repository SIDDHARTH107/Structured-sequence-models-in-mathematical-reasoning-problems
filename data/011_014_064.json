    "message_2": "A subgraph with 4 vertices can have at most a complete graph structure, which means every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In a complete graph with 4 vertices (also known as K4), there are 4 * (4 - 1) / 2 = 6 edges. Therefore, the maximum number of edges that a subgraph of this graph with 4 vertices can have is 6."
