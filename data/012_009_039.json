    "message_2": "To find a possible degree sequence of G, we need to ensure that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is even (according to the Handshaking Lemma) and that the sequence follows the constraints given (degree of each vertex is between 1 and 6).\n\nLet's consider the following degree sequence: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6). This sequence satisfies the constraints given, and the sum of the degrees is even (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 33, which is odd).\n\nHowever, we can modify the sequence to make the sum even while still satisfying the constraints. Let's change the degree of the first vertex from 1 to 2: (2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6). Now the sum of the degrees is even (2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 34, which is even).\n\nSo, a possible degree sequence for G is (2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6)."
