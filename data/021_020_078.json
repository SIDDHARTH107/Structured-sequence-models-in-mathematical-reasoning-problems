    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 4x - 10 using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Search range: [-5, 5]\n   - Number of iterations: 20\n   - Number of bees: 10 (a common choice)\n   - Number of employed bees: 5 (half of the bees)\n   - Number of onlooker bees: 5 (half of the bees)\n   - Limit for scout bees: 5 (a common choice)\n\n2. Generate the initial population of bees randomly within the search range.\n\n3. For each iteration:\n   a. Calculate the fitness of each bee using the function f(x).\n   b. Employed bees search for a new solution in the neighborhood of their current solution.\n   c. Calculate the probability of selecting each employed bee based on their fitness.\n   d. Onlooker bees search for a new solution in the neighborhood of the employed bees based on the probabilities.\n   e. Update the best solution found so far.\n   f. If any bee reaches the scout limit, replace it with a new randomly generated bee.\n\n4. After 20 iterations, return the best solution found.\n\nI cannot execute the algorithm as a human, but you can implement the ABC algorithm in a programming language like Python or MATLAB to find the maximum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 4x - 10 within the given search range and number of iterations."
