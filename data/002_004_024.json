    "message_1": "A rectangular plot of land is 25 meters long and 15 meters wide. What is the perimeter of the plot of land?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length (L) is 25 meters and the width (W) is 15 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 2(25 + 15)\nP = 2(40)\nP = 80\n\nThe perimeter of the plot of land is 80 meters."
