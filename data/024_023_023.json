    "message_2": "A rotational symmetry is a transformation that rotates an object around an axis such that the object remains unchanged after the rotation. In this case, we are considering the surface of revolution M generated by rotating the curve y = x^2/4 about the x-axis.\n\nSince M is a surface of revolution, it is symmetric about the x-axis. This means that any rotation around the x-axis will result in the same surface. Therefore, M has an infinite number of rotational symmetries around the x-axis."
