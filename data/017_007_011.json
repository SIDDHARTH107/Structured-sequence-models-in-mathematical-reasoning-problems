    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 6 is either isomorphic to a cyclic group C6 or to a dihedral group D3, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. If a group has an element of order 6, it is isomorphic to C6.\n2. If a group has an element of order 3 and an element of order 2, it is isomorphic to D3.\n\nLet G be a group of order 6. By Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Since G is a finite group, it must have an identity element e with order 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases for the orders of the other elements in G:\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 6.\nIf G has an element a with order 6, then G is generated by a and is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6. In this case, we are done.\n\nCase 2: G has no element of order 6.\nIn this case, the remaining possible orders for the elements of G are 2 and 3. Since G has order 6, it must have at least one element of order 3. Let a be an element of order 3 in G. Then, G has at least two elements of order 3, namely a and a^2, since a^3 = e.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining three elements of G. At least one of these elements must have order 2, as otherwise, G would have more than two elements of order 3, which would contradict the fact that G has order 6. Let b be an element of order 2 in G.\n\nSince G has order 6, it is generated by the elements a and b. We can now show that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3. The dihedral group D3 is generated by two elements r and s, where r has order 3, s has order 2, and s * r * s = r^(-1). We can map a to r and b to s in an isomorphism between G and D3.\n\nTo show that this mapping is an isomorphism, we need to verify that the group operation is preserved. We have:\n\n1. a * a = a^2, which maps to r^2.\n2. a * a^2 = a^3 = e, which maps to the identity element in D3.\n3. b * b = e, which maps to the identity element in D3.\n\nNow, we need to check the relation between a and b:\n\na * b * a = a * a * b = a^2 * b\n\nSince b has order 2, b^(-1) = b. Thus, we have:\n\na * b * a = a^2 * b^(-1)\n\nThis relation is equivalent to the relation s * r * s = r^(-1) in D3. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3.\n\nIn conclusion, if a group G of order 6 has an element of order 6, it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6. If it has no element of order 6, it must have elements of orders 2 and 3, and it is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3."
