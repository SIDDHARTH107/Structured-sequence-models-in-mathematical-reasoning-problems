    "message_1": "Let $E$ be an elliptic curve whose Weierstrass equation is given by $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$. Suppose that $E$ has exactly 6 points of order 2, i.e., points $P$ on $E$ such that $2P = \\mathcal{O}$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ denotes the point at infinity. Find the discriminant $\\Delta$ of $E$ in terms of $A$ and $B$.",
    "message_2": "For a point $P$ on the elliptic curve $E$ to have order 2, it must satisfy $2P = \\mathcal{O}$. This means that $P$ must be a point on the curve with $y$-coordinate equal to 0, since adding a point to itself involves reflecting it across the x-axis and then taking the tangent line at that point.\n\nSo, we are looking for points $(x, 0)$ on the curve $E$ such that $x^3 + Ax + B = 0$. Since there are exactly 6 points of order 2, the cubic polynomial $x^3 + Ax + B$ must have 3 distinct double roots. Let these roots be $x_1, x_2, x_3$. Then, we can write the polynomial as:\n\n$(x - x_1)^2(x - x_2)^2(x - x_3)^2 = x^6 - 2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3)x^5 + \\cdots$\n\nNow, we can find the discriminant $\\Delta$ of the elliptic curve. The discriminant is given by the formula:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$\n\nWe need to express $\\Delta$ in terms of $A$ and $B$. To do this, we can use the fact that the coefficients of the polynomial $x^3 + Ax + B$ are related to the roots $x_1, x_2, x_3$. Specifically, we have:\n\n$A = x_1^2x_2^2 + x_1^2x_3^2 + x_2^2x_3^2$\n\n$B = -x_1^2x_2^2x_3^2$\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions for $A$ and $B$ into the formula for $\\Delta$:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4(x_1^2x_2^2 + x_1^2x_3^2 + x_2^2x_3^2)^3 + 27(-x_1^2x_2^2x_3^2)^2)$\n\nThis expression for $\\Delta$ is in terms of the roots $x_1, x_2, x_3$, which are related to the points of order 2 on the elliptic curve. Since the problem asks for $\\Delta$ in terms of $A$ and $B$, we can rewrite this expression using the relations we found earlier:\n\n$\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$\n\nThis is the discriminant of the elliptic curve $E$ with Weierstrass equation $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ and exactly 6 points of order 2."
