    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in both.\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A Δ B, denoted as (A Δ B)'. The complement of a set is the set of elements that are not in the given set. Since we are not given a universal set, we will assume the universal set U to be the union of A and B.\n\nU = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\n(A Δ B)' = U - (A Δ B) = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B', respectively.\n\nA' = U - A = {4}\nB' = U - B = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B', denoted as A' Δ B'. \n\nA' Δ B' = {1, 4}\n\nNow, we can see that the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) and its complement (A Δ B)' is not equal to the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B, i.e., A' Δ B'.\n\n(A Δ B) Δ (A Δ B)' = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA' Δ B' = {1, 4}\n\nSince (A Δ B) Δ (A Δ B)' ≠ A' Δ B', the statement is proven."
