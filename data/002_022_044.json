    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 5 cm and a minor radius of 3 cm. What is the volume of the torus?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius^2) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nwhere minor_radius is the minor radius of the torus and major_radius is the major radius of the torus.\n\nIn this case, the minor radius is 3 cm and the major radius is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 3^2) * (2 * π * 5)\n\nVolume = (π * 9) * (10 * π)\n\nVolume = 90 * π^2\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 282.74 cm^3 (rounded to two decimal places)."
