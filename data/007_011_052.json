    "message_2": "A quadratic residue is a number that can be represented as the square of an integer modulo some other number. In this case, we want to find the quadratic residues modulo 15.\n\nTo find the quadratic residues of 15, we can calculate the squares of the integers from 0 to 14 (since 15 is the modulus) and then reduce them modulo 15. Here are the calculations:\n\n0² ≡ 0 (mod 15)\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 15)\n2² ≡ 4 (mod 15)\n3² ≡ 9 (mod 15)\n4² ≡ 1 (mod 15)\n5² ≡ 10 (mod 15)\n6² ≡ 6 (mod 15)\n7² ≡ 4 (mod 15)\n8² ≡ 9 (mod 15)\n9² ≡ 6 (mod 15)\n10² ≡ 10 (mod 15)\n11² ≡ 1 (mod 15)\n12² ≡ 9 (mod 15)\n13² ≡ 4 (mod 15)\n14² ≡ 1 (mod 15)\n\nNow, we can list the unique residues:\n\n0, 1, 4, 6, 9, 10\n\nSo, the quadratic residues modulo 15 are 0, 1, 4, 6, 9, and 10."
