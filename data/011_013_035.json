    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Polya Enumeration Theorem (PET). The PET is a combinatorial method used to count objects under a group action, such as the rotation of necklaces.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cyclic group C_12, which represents the 12 possible rotations of a necklace with 12 beads. The cycle index of C_12 is given by:\n\nP(C_12) = (1/12) * (a_1^12 + 4a_1^6a_2^3 + 6a_1^4a_2 + 12a_1^2a_2^5)\n\nNow, we substitute a_i with the sum of the number of ways to color the beads (in this case, black and white). So, a_i = b^i + w^i, where b and w represent black and white beads, respectively.\n\nP(C_12) = (1/12) * ((b + w)^12 + 4(b + w)^6(b^2 + w^2)^3 + 6(b + w)^4(b^2 + w^2) + 12(b + w)^2(b^2 + w^2)^5)\n\nWe are given 8 black beads and 4 white beads, so we substitute b = 8 and w = 4:\n\nP(C_12) = (1/12) * ((8 + 4)^12 + 4(8 + 4)^6(8^2 + 4^2)^3 + 6(8 + 4)^4(8^2 + 4^2) + 12(8 + 4)^2(8^2 + 4^2)^5)\n\nP(C_12) = (1/12) * (12^12 + 4 * 12^6 * (64 + 16)^3 + 6 * 12^4 * (64 + 16) + 12 * 12^2 * (64 + 16)^5)\n\nAfter calculating the expression, we get:\n\nP(C_12) = 385\n\nSo, there are 385 distinct necklaces that can be made by stringing together 8 black beads and 4 white beads, considering the necklaces that can be rotated to form each other as the same."
