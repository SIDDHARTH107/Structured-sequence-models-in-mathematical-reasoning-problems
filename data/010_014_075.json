    "message_2": "To find the cohomology groups H^i(X) of a sphere X of radius 3 centered at the origin in R^3, we can use the fact that the cohomology groups of a sphere are the same as those of a sphere of any other radius, as long as it is centered at the origin.\n\nThe sphere X is a 2-dimensional manifold, also known as the 2-sphere, S^2. The cohomology groups of S^2 can be computed using cellular cohomology or singular cohomology. In this case, we will use cellular cohomology.\n\nConsider the CW complex structure of S^2, which consists of one 0-cell, one 2-cell, and no 1-cells. The cellular chain complex is given by:\n\n0 → Z → 0 → Z → 0\n\nwhere the first Z corresponds to the 2-cell and the second Z corresponds to the 0-cell. The differentials are all zero maps since there are no 1-cells.\n\nNow we compute the cohomology groups H^i(X) as the kernel of the differential maps divided by the image of the previous differential map. Since all the differentials are zero maps, the cohomology groups are:\n\nH^0(X) = Z (since the kernel of the first differential map is Z and there is no previous differential map)\nH^1(X) = 0 (since there is no 1-cell)\nH^2(X) = Z (since the kernel of the second differential map is Z and there is no previous differential map)\n\nFor i > 2, the cohomology groups are trivial:\n\nH^i(X) = 0 for i > 2\n\nSo the cohomology groups of the sphere X are:\n\nH^0(X) = Z\nH^1(X) = 0\nH^2(X) = Z\nH^i(X) = 0 for i > 2"
