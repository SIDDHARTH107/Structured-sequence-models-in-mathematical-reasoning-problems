    "message_1": "Suppose there are four bidders participating in an auction for a painting. Each bidder has a private valuation for the painting and it is known to follow an exponential distribution. The values are as follows: $12, 18, 21$, and $25$, and their probabilities are equal. Find the expected revenue of the auction if the auction is a first-price sealed-bid auction.",
    "message_2": "In a first-price sealed-bid auction, each bidder submits a bid in a sealed envelope, and the highest bidder wins the auction and pays their bid. Since the probabilities of each valuation are equal, we can assume that each valuation has a probability of 1/4.\n\nLet's consider each possible winning bid and calculate the expected revenue for each case.\n\n1. Bidder with valuation $12 wins:\n   This can only happen if all other bidders bid below $12. Since the bidders are assumed to bid their valuations, this case is not possible.\n\n2. Bidder with valuation $18 wins:\n   This can happen if the bidder with valuation $18 bids a value slightly above $12 (let's say $12+\\epsilon$), and the other bidders bid below $12$. The probability of this happening is 1/4 (since each valuation has a probability of 1/4). The expected revenue in this case is $(12+\\epsilon) \\times \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n3. Bidder with valuation $21 wins:\n   This can happen if the bidder with valuation $21 bids a value slightly above $18 (let's say $18+\\epsilon$), and the other bidders bid below $18$. The probability of this happening is 1/4. The expected revenue in this case is $(18+\\epsilon) \\times \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n4. Bidder with valuation $25 wins:\n   This can happen if the bidder with valuation $25 bids a value slightly above $21 (let's say $21+\\epsilon$), and the other bidders bid below $21$. The probability of this happening is 1/4. The expected revenue in this case is $(21+\\epsilon) \\times \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nNow, let's sum up the expected revenues for each case:\n\nExpected revenue = $(12+\\epsilon) \\times \\frac{1}{4} + (18+\\epsilon) \\times \\frac{1}{4} + (21+\\epsilon) \\times \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nExpected revenue = $\\frac{1}{4}(12+18+21) + \\frac{3\\epsilon}{4}$\n\nSince $\\epsilon$ is very small, we can ignore it in our calculation:\n\nExpected revenue = $\\frac{1}{4}(12+18+21)$\n\nExpected revenue = $\\frac{1}{4}(51)$\n\nExpected revenue = $12.75$\n\nSo, the expected revenue of the auction if it is a first-price sealed-bid auction is $12.75."
