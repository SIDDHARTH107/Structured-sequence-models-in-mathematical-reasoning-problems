    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of products, A and B. To make one unit of product A, it requires one hour of labor and two units of raw materials. To make one unit of product B, it requires two hours of labor and one unit of raw material. The manufacturer has five hours of labor and ten units of raw materials available. Find the maximum number of units of product A and B that can be produced using multi-objective optimization.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We have the following constraints:\n\n1 hour of labor for A: x\n2 hours of labor for B: 2y\nTotal labor: x + 2y ≤ 5\n\n2 units of raw materials for A: 2x\n1 unit of raw material for B: y\nTotal raw materials: 2x + y ≤ 10\n\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nWe want to maximize the total number of units produced, which is x + y.\n\nFirst, we can rearrange the labor constraint:\nx + 2y ≤ 5\nx = 5 - 2y\n\nNow, substitute this into the raw materials constraint:\n2(5 - 2y) + y ≤ 10\n10 - 4y + y ≤ 10\n-3y ≤ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nSince we already have the non-negativity constraint y ≥ 0, we can now find the maximum number of units produced.\n\nSubstitute the value of x from the labor constraint into the objective function:\nx + y = (5 - 2y) + y\nx + y = 5 - y\n\nTo maximize the total number of units produced, we should minimize y. The minimum value of y is 0 (from the non-negativity constraint). So, we have:\n\nx + y = 5 - 0\nx + y = 5\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y that satisfy this equation and the constraints:\n\ny = 0\nx = 5 - 2y\nx = 5 - 2(0)\nx = 5\n\nSo, the maximum number of units of product A and B that can be produced is 5 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
