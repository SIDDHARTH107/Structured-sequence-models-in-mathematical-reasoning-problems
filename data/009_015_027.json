    "message_2": "To model the amount of a radioactive substance remaining after \"t\" days, we can use the exponential decay formula:\n\nA(t) = A₀ * (1/2)^(t/T)\n\nwhere:\n- A(t) is the amount of the substance remaining after \"t\" days\n- A₀ is the initial amount of the substance (in this case, 500 mg)\n- (1/2) is the decay factor, since the substance has a half-life\n- t is the time in days\n- T is the half-life of the substance (in this case, 10 days)\n\nSo, the equation that models the amount of substance remaining after \"t\" days is:\n\nA(t) = 500 * (1/2)^(t/10)\n\nNow, we want to find how much of the substance will remain after 30 days. We can plug \"t = 30\" into the equation:\n\nA(30) = 500 * (1/2)^(30/10)\n\nA(30) = 500 * (1/2)^3\n\nA(30) = 500 * (1/8)\n\nA(30) = 62.5 mg\n\nSo, after 30 days, 62.5 mg of the radioactive substance will remain."
