The production time, profit, and minimum number of workers required for each model are given in the table below:\n\n| Car Model | Production Time (hours) | Profit ($) | Minimum Workers |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| X | 10 | 3000 | 5 |\n| Y | 8 | 2500 | 4 |\n| Z | 12 | 4000 | 6 |\n\nThe company has exactly 60 hours of production time available and can hire a maximum of 20 workers. How many cars of each model should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x, y, and z represent the number of cars produced for Model X, Model Y, and Model Z, respectively. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y, z) = 3000x + 2500y + 4000z, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. 10x + 8y + 12z <= 60 (production time constraint)\n2. 5x + 4y + 6z <= 20 (worker constraint)\n3. x, y, z >= 0 (non-negative production)\n\nFirst, we can simplify the worker constraint by dividing by the greatest common divisor (2):\n\n2.5x + 2y + 3z <= 10\n\nNow, we can use integer linear programming to solve this problem. However, we can also try to find a solution by analyzing the constraints and using some logic.\n\nFrom the production time constraint, we can see that producing only Model Z cars is not possible, as 12z > 60 for any z > 0. Similarly, producing only Model X or Model Y cars would not utilize the full 60 hours of production time.\n\nLet's consider producing a combination of Model X and Model Y cars. If we produce 3 Model X cars and 3 Model Y cars, we would use 30 + 24 = 54 hours of production time and 15 + 12 = 27 workers. However, this exceeds the worker constraint. \n\nNow, let's try producing a combination of Model X and Model Z cars. If we produce 2 Model X cars and 4 Model Y cars, we would use 20 + 48 = 68 hours of production time and 10 + 24 = 34 workers, which also exceeds both constraints.\n\nFinally, let's try producing a combination of Model Y and Model Z cars. If we produce 1 Model Y car and 4 Model Z cars, we would use 8 + 48 = 56 hours of production time and 4 + 24 = 28 workers, which still exceeds the worker constraint.\n\nHowever, if we produce 2 Model Y cars and 3 Model Z cars, we would use 16 + 36 = 52 hours of production time and 8 + 18 = 26 workers. This still exceeds the worker constraint, but we can see that we are getting closer to a feasible solution.\n\nLet's try producing 3 Model Y cars and 2 Model Z cars. This would use 24 + 24 = 48 hours of production time and 12 + 12 = 24 workers. This solution satisfies both constraints.\n\nSo, the company should produce 3 Model Y cars and 2 Model Z cars to maximize its profit. The total profit would be 2500 * 3 + 4000 * 2 = 7500 + 8000 = $15,500."
