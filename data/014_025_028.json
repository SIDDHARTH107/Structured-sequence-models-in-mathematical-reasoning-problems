    "message_2": "To compute the SHA-256 hash value of the message \"HELLO\", you can use a programming language or an online tool. Here, I'll provide you with the resulting hash value:\n\nH(M) = \"185f8db32271fe25f561a6fc938b2e264306ec304eda518007d1764826381969\"\n\nKeep in mind that cryptographic hash functions are designed to be deterministic, meaning that the same input will always produce the same output. However, they are also designed to be one-way functions, meaning it should be computationally infeasible to determine the original input from the hash value."
