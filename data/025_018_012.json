    "message_2": "We will use the following lemma:\n\nLemma: Let $D$ be a nef $\\mathbb{Q}$-divisor on a smooth projective variety $X$. Then for any irreducible subvariety $Y \\subset X$, we have $D^{\\dim Y} \\cdot Y \\geq 0$.\n\nProof of Lemma: This follows from the definition of nef divisors. A divisor $D$ is nef if and only if $D \\cdot C \\geq 0$ for every curve $C$ on $X$. By the intersection theory, this inequality extends to higher-dimensional subvarieties as well.\n\nNow we proceed with the main proof. Since $D$ is big and nef, by the lemma, we have $D^{n+1} \\geq 0$. We want to show that $D^{n+1} \\geq a_1a_2\\cdots a_{n+1}$. \n\nConsider the intersection $D_1 \\cap D_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap D_{n+1}$. Since the $D_i$ are distinct irreducible subvarieties, their intersection is a non-empty, finite set of points. Let $p$ be a point in this intersection. Then, we have\n\n$D^{n+1} = D \\cdot D \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot D \\geq D \\cdot D_1 \\cdot D_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot D_{n+1}$.\n\nNow, note that $D \\cdot D_1 \\cdot D_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot D_{n+1}$ is equal to the sum of the intersection numbers $D \\cdot D_1 \\cdot D_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot D_{n+1} \\cdot p$ over all points $p$ in the intersection $D_1 \\cap D_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap D_{n+1}$. \n\nFor each point $p$ in the intersection, we have\n\n$D \\cdot D_1 \\cdot D_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot D_{n+1} \\cdot p = a_1a_2\\cdots a_{n+1} D_1 \\cdot D_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot D_{n+1} \\cdot p \\geq a_1a_2\\cdots a_{n+1}$,\n\nsince $D_1 \\cdot D_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot D_{n+1} \\cdot p \\geq 1$ for all points $p$ in the intersection.\n\nSumming over all points $p$ in the intersection, we obtain\n\n$D^{n+1} \\geq D \\cdot D_1 \\cdot D_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot D_{n+1} \\geq a_1a_2\\cdots a_{n+1}$,\n\nas desired."
