    "message_2": "The only cyclic group of prime order is the group Z_p, where p is a prime number. This group consists of the integers {0, 1, 2, ..., p-1} under addition modulo p. Since p is prime, every non-zero element in the group has order p, making the group cyclic with a generator of order p."
