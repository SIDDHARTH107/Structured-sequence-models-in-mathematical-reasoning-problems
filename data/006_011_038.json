    "message_1": "In a factory of 50 workers, it is found that 10% of them have experienced a workplace accident in the last year. What is the probability that a randomly chosen worker has not experienced a workplace accident in the last year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen worker has not experienced a workplace accident in the last year, we first need to find the number of workers who have not experienced an accident.\n\nSince 10% of the 50 workers have experienced an accident, that means 0.10 * 50 = 5 workers have experienced an accident.\n\nNow, we subtract the number of workers who have experienced an accident from the total number of workers to find the number of workers who have not experienced an accident: 50 - 5 = 45 workers.\n\nFinally, we divide the number of workers who have not experienced an accident by the total number of workers to find the probability: 45 / 50 = 0.9 or 90%.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen worker has not experienced a workplace accident in the last year is 90%."
