    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n| 0.001  2 | 4 |\n|  4     8 |16 |\n\nNext, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form. We will start by multiplying the first row by 4000 to eliminate the small value in the first row:\n\n|  4  8000 |16000 |\n|  4    8  |  16  |\n\nNow, we will subtract the first row from the second row to eliminate the 4 in the second row:\n\n|  4  8000 |16000 |\n|  0 -7992 |-15984|\n\nNow, we will divide the second row by -7992 to get a 1 in the second column:\n\n|  4  8000 |16000 |\n|  0     1 |   2  |\n\nNow, we will subtract 8000 times the second row from the first row to eliminate the 8000 in the first row:\n\n|  4     0 |  -8000 |\n|  0     1 |      2 |\n\nFinally, we will divide the first row by 4 to get a 1 in the first column:\n\n|  1     0 | -2000 |\n|  0     1 |     2 |\n\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form, and we can read the solution directly from the matrix:\n\nx = -2000\ny = 2\n\nHowever, as noted, the matrix is ill-conditioned, which can lead to inaccuracies in the solution. In this case, the solution is accurate, but it's important to be aware of potential inaccuracies when working with ill-conditioned matrices."
