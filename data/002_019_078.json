    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral area (a sector of a circle) and then add them together.\n\n1. Base area (A_base): \nA_base = π * r^2\nA_base = π * (7 cm)^2\nA_base = 49π cm^2\n\n2. Lateral area (A_lateral):\nA_lateral = 1/2 * Circumference of base * Slant height\nCircumference of base = 2 * π * r\nCircumference of base = 2 * π * 7 cm\nCircumference of base = 14π cm\n\nA_lateral = 1/2 * (14π cm) * (15 cm)\nA_lateral = 7π cm * 15 cm\nA_lateral = 105π cm^2\n\n3. Total surface area (A_total):\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 49π cm^2 + 105π cm^2\nA_total = 154π cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cone is 154π cm^2."
