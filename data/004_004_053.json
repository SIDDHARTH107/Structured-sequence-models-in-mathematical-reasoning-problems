    "message_2": "To find the area under the curve y = 2x + 1 from x = 0 to x = 4, we need to integrate the function with respect to x and then evaluate it at the given limits.\n\nThe function is y = 2x + 1. Let's integrate it with respect to x:\n\nâˆ«(2x + 1) dx = x^2 + x + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the given limits, x = 0 and x = 4:\n\nArea = (x^2 + x)| from 0 to 4\n\nFirst, let's find the value of the integral at x = 4:\n\n(4^2 + 4) = (16 + 4) = 20\n\nNow, let's find the value of the integral at x = 0:\n\n(0^2 + 0) = 0\n\nNow, subtract the value of the integral at x = 0 from the value at x = 4:\n\nArea = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nSo, the area under the curve y = 2x + 1 from x = 0 to x = 4 is 20 square units."
