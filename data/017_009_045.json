    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9, we need to show that G is generated by a single element of order 9, which is given as the element a.\n\nSince G is a group of order 9 and a ∈ G has order 9, this means that the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by a, denoted as ⟨a⟩, is also 9. In other words, ⟨a⟩ = {e, a, a², a³, ..., a⁸}, where e is the identity element in G.\n\nNow, we need to show that G = ⟨a⟩, which means that every element in G is also an element in ⟨a⟩.\n\nSince the order of G is 9 and the order of ⟨a⟩ is 9, we know that |G| = |⟨a⟩|. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Since |⟨a⟩| = 9, it must be the case that ⟨a⟩ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since |G| = |⟨a⟩|, we can conclude that G = ⟨a⟩.\n\nThus, G is a cyclic group generated by the element a of order 9. Since C9 is also a cyclic group of order 9, we can establish an isomorphism between G and C9 by defining a mapping φ: G → C9 such that φ(a^k) = k mod 9, where k = 0, 1, ..., 8.\n\nWe can check that φ is a homomorphism:\n\nφ(a^k * a^l) = φ(a^(k+l)) = (k + l) mod 9\nφ(a^k) * φ(a^l) = (k mod 9) * (l mod 9) = (k + l) mod 9\n\nSince φ(a^k * a^l) = φ(a^k) * φ(a^l) for all k, l ∈ {0, 1, ..., 8}, φ is a homomorphism.\n\nMoreover, φ is bijective:\n\n1. Injective: If φ(a^k) = φ(a^l), then (k mod 9) = (l mod 9), which implies k = l. Thus, φ is injective.\n\n2. Surjective: For any integer n ∈ {0, 1, ..., 8}, there exists an element a^n ∈ G such that φ(a^n) = n mod 9. Thus, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a bijective homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, we have shown that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9."
