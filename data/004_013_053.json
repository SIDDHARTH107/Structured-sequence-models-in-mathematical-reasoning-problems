    "message_2": "To find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the function on the interval [0, 5], we need to find the critical points and endpoints of the function and evaluate the function at these points.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow, evaluate the function at the critical points and endpoints:\n\nf(0) = 0^3 - 6(0)^2 + 9(0) + 1 = 1\nf(1) = 1^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 1 = -1\nf(3) = 3^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 1 = -1\nf(5) = 5^3 - 6(5)^2 + 9(5) + 1 = 1\n\nThe absolute maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 5] is 1, which occurs at x = 0 and x = 5. The absolute minimum value of the function on the interval [0, 5] is -1, which occurs at x = 1 and x = 3."
