    "message_2": "To compute the order of the Jacobian variety of the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + x - 1$ over $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we first need to find the number of points on the curve over $\\mathbb{F}_7$. This can be done using the Hasse-Weil theorem, which states that the number of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is approximately $q + 1 - a$, where $|a|$ is bounded by $2\\sqrt{q}$. In our case, $q = 7$.\n\nWe can find the number of points on the curve by checking all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$ and counting the ones that satisfy the equation of the curve. We also need to include the point at infinity, which is always on an elliptic curve.\n\nChecking all combinations of $x$ and $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we find the following points on the curve:\n\n$(0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0)$\n\nIncluding the point at infinity, we have a total of 13 points on the curve.\n\nNow, the order of the Jacobian variety of the elliptic curve, $J(E)$, is equal to the number of points on the curve. Therefore, the order of $J(E)$ over $\\mathbb{F}_7$ is 13."
