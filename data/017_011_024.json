    "message_2": "To find the possible number of subgroups of a group of order 12, we first consider the divisors of 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. Therefore, there can be subgroups of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nNow, let's analyze the three given groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 12 (C12): \nA cyclic group of order 12 is generated by a single element of order 12. The subgroups of a cyclic group are also cyclic, and there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of the group order. Therefore, C12 has subgroups of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, making a total of 6 subgroups.\n\n2. Alternating group of degree 4 (A4): \nA4 has order 12 and is generated by 3-cycles and double transpositions. The subgroups of A4 are:\n\n- The trivial subgroup of order 1.\n- Three subgroups of order 2, generated by double transpositions.\n- Four subgroups of order 3, generated by 3-cycles.\n- The whole group A4 of order 12.\n\nIn total, A4 has 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 9 subgroups.\n\n3. Dihedral group of order 12 (D12): \nD12 is the group of symmetries of a regular 6-gon (hexagon). It has 6 rotational symmetries and 6 reflection symmetries. The subgroups of D12 are:\n\n- The trivial subgroup of order 1.\n- Two subgroups of order 2, generated by reflections.\n- One subgroup of order 3, generated by a 120-degree rotation.\n- Two subgroups of order 4, generated by 60-degree and 180-degree rotations.\n- One subgroup of order 6, generated by a 60-degree rotation and a reflection.\n- The whole group D12 of order 12.\n\nIn total, D12 has 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8 subgroups.\n\nComparing the number of subgroups, we can see that none of the given groups (C12, A4, and D12) have the same number of subgroups."
