    "message_2": "To find the number of poles of the function f(z)/theta(z) in the upper half-plane, we first need to find the poles of f(z) in the upper half-plane.\n\nThe function f(z) has the following factors:\n\n1. (z^4 - 1) = (z^2 - 1)(z^2 + 1) = (z - 1)(z + 1)(z - i)(z + i)\n2. (z - 2 - i)^3\n3. (z - 2 + i)^3\n4. (z + 2 - i)^3\n5. (z + 2 + i)^3\n\nNow, we need to find the poles of f(z) in the upper half-plane:\n\n1. From the factor (z - 1)(z + 1)(z - i)(z + i), we have the poles z = i and z = 1.\n2. From the factor (z - 2 - i)^3, we have the pole z = 2 + i.\n3. From the factor (z - 2 + i)^3, we have the pole z = 2 - i, which is not in the upper half-plane.\n4. From the factor (z + 2 - i)^3, we have the pole z = -2 + i.\n5. From the factor (z + 2 + i)^3, we have the pole z = -2 - i, which is not in the upper half-plane.\n\nSo, the poles of f(z) in the upper half-plane are z = i, z = 1, z = 2 + i, and z = -2 + i.\n\nNow, we need to consider the poles of the Jacobi theta function, theta(z). The Jacobi theta function has zeros at z = n + 1/2 for all integers n, but no poles. Therefore, the function f(z)/theta(z) will have the same poles as f(z) in the upper half-plane.\n\nThus, the number of poles of the function f(z)/theta(z) in the upper half-plane is 4."
