    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety V defined by the equation y^3 - x^2 = 0, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet f(x, y) = y^3 - x^2. Then, the partial derivatives are:\n\n∂f/∂x = -2x\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n-2x = 0 => x = 0\n3y^2 = 0 => y = 0\n\nSo, the only singular point is (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's determine the type of this singularity. We can compute the second partial derivatives:\n\n∂²f/∂x² = -2\n∂²f/∂y² = 6y\n∂²f/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we compute the Hessian matrix H at the singular point (0, 0):\n\nH(0, 0) = | -2  0 |\n          |  0  0 |\n\nThe determinant of the Hessian matrix at the singular point is:\n\ndet(H(0, 0)) = (-2)(0) - (0)(0) = 0\n\nSince the determinant of the Hessian matrix is 0, we cannot determine the type of the singularity using the Hessian matrix. However, we can analyze the equation y^3 - x^2 = 0 directly. This equation represents a cusp singularity, as the curve has a sharp point at the origin (0, 0).\n\nIn conclusion, the algebraic variety V has a singular point at (0, 0), and the type of the singularity is a cusp."
