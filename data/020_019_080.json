    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question related to optimal control for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose a company produces a certain item and faces a cost function of the form C(q) = 200q + 0.2q^2 + 400, where q is the production rate in units per hour. The product is sold at a constant price of $10 per unit. What is the optimal production rate that maximizes the company's profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production rate that maximizes the company's profit, we first need to find the profit function. The profit function is given by the revenue function minus the cost function:\n\nProfit(q) = Revenue(q) - Cost(q)\n\nThe revenue function is given by the price per unit multiplied by the number of units produced:\n\nRevenue(q) = 10q\n\nNow, we can find the profit function:\n\nProfit(q) = 10q - (200q + 0.2q^2 + 400)\n\nSimplify the profit function:\n\nProfit(q) = 10q - 200q - 0.2q^2 - 400\nProfit(q) = -0.2q^2 - 190q - 400\n\nTo find the optimal production rate, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking the derivative with respect to q and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit)/dq = -0.4q - 190\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for q:\n\n-0.4q - 190 = 0\n-0.4q = 190\nq = 190 / 0.4\nq = 475\n\nSo, the optimal production rate that maximizes the company's profit is 475 units per hour."
