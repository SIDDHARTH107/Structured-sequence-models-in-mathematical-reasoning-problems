    "message_2": "To solve the equation |4x - 5| = 11, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 4x - 5 is positive or zero, so the equation becomes:\n4x - 5 = 11\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n4x = 16\nx = 4\n\nCase 2: 4x - 5 is negative, so the equation becomes:\n-(4x - 5) = 11\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n-4x + 5 = 11\n-4x = 6\nx = -1.5\n\nSo, the values of x that satisfy the equation are x = 4 and x = -1.5."
