    "message_2": "1) (0,1)\n\nConnected: Yes\nPath-connected: Yes\n\nProof: The subset (0,1) is an open interval in the Euclidean topology. It is connected because it cannot be written as the union of two nonempty disjoint open sets. To see this, suppose (0,1) = A ∪ B, where A and B are nonempty disjoint open sets. Let a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Without loss of generality, assume a < b. Then, there exists a point c ∈ (0,1) such that a < c < b. Since A and B are open, there exists an open interval around c that is contained in either A or B. However, this would imply that A and B are not disjoint, which is a contradiction. Therefore, (0,1) is connected.\n\nTo show that (0,1) is path-connected, we need to show that for any two points x, y ∈ (0,1), there exists a continuous function f: [0,1] → (0,1) such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y. Define f(t) = (1-t)x + ty. It is clear that f is continuous, and f(0) = x and f(1) = y. Thus, (0,1) is path-connected.\n\n2) [0,1] ∪ [2,3]\n\nConnected: No\nPath-connected: No\n\nConnected components: [0,1] and [2,3]\n\nProof: The subset [0,1] ∪ [2,3] is not connected because it can be written as the union of two nonempty disjoint open sets, namely A = (0,1) ∪ {1} and B = {2} ∪ (2,3). The connected components are [0,1] and [2,3], which are both connected and path-connected as intervals in the Euclidean topology.\n\nTo show that [0,1] ∪ [2,3] is not path-connected, consider the points x = 1 and y = 2. Any continuous function f: [0,1] → ([0,1] ∪ [2,3]) with f(0) = x and f(1) = y must have its image cross from the interval [0,1] to the interval [2,3]. However, there is no continuous way to do this without passing through the disconnected region between the two intervals. Therefore, [0,1] ∪ [2,3] is not path-connected.\n\n3) The set of rational numbers in [0,1]\n\nConnected: No\nPath-connected: No\n\nConnected components: Singletons {q} for each q ∈ [0,1] ∩ Q\n\nProof: The set of rational numbers in [0,1], denoted as Q ∩ [0,1], is not connected because it can be written as the union of two nonempty disjoint open sets in the subspace topology. For example, let A = {q ∈ Q ∩ [0,1] : q < π/4} and B = {q ∈ Q ∩ [0,1] : q > π/4}. Both A and B are open in the subspace topology, and their union is Q ∩ [0,1].\n\nThe connected components of Q ∩ [0,1] are the singletons {q} for each q ∈ [0,1] ∩ Q. This is because each singleton is connected (as it cannot be written as the union of two nonempty disjoint open sets), and any larger subset of Q ∩ [0,1] containing more than one point can be separated into two nonempty disjoint open sets, as shown above.\n\nTo show that Q ∩ [0,1] is not path-connected, consider any two distinct points x, y ∈ Q ∩ [0,1]. Any continuous function f: [0,1] → (Q ∩ [0,1]) with f(0) = x and f(1) = y would have to pass through an irrational point, since the irrationals are dense in the real numbers. However, this is not possible, as the function's image must be contained in Q ∩ [0,1]. Therefore, Q ∩ [0,1] is not path-connected."
