    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ centered at $z=1$, we first rewrite the function in terms of $w = z-1$. Then, we have:\n\n$$f(z) = f(w+1) = \\frac{w+2}{w(w-1)}.$$\n\nNow, we perform partial fraction decomposition on this expression:\n\n$$\\frac{w+2}{w(w-1)} = \\frac{A}{w} + \\frac{B}{w-1}.$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $w(w-1)$, we get:\n\n$$w+2 = A(w-1) + Bw.$$\n\nExpanding and collecting terms, we have:\n\n$$w+2 = (A+B)w - A.$$\n\nNow, we can equate coefficients of the powers of $w$:\n\n$$A+B = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -A = 2.$$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that $A=-2$ and $B=3$. Thus, we can rewrite our function as:\n\n$$f(w+1) = -\\frac{2}{w} + \\frac{3}{w-1}.$$\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion of each term. For the first term, we have:\n\n$$-\\frac{2}{w} = -2\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} w^n.$$\n\nFor the second term, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{3}{w-1} = 3\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} w^n.$$\n\nAdding these two series together, we get the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ centered at $z=1$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n=-1}^{\\infty} c_n (z-1)^n,$$\n\nwhere $c_n = -2$ for $n=-1$ and $c_n = 3-2 = 1$ for $n\\geq 0$.\n\nNow, let's determine the convergence of this series in the annulus $1<|z-1|\\le2$. Since the function has singularities at $z=1$ and $z=2$, the Laurent series converges in the annulus between these two singularities. Thus, the series converges in the annulus $1<|z-1|\\le2$."
