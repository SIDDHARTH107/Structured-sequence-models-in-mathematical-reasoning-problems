Find the homotopy class of a path $\\gamma(s)$ such that $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma_0(0)$ and $\\gamma(1) = \\gamma_1(1)$ by computing the fundamental group of the topological space given by the union $X = (\\mathbb{R} \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup (\\mathbb{R} \\times \\{1\\}) \\cup \\{(0, y) | y \\in [0,1] \\}$ using the Seifert-Van Kampen theorem.",
    "message_2": "To apply the Seifert-Van Kampen theorem, we need to cover the space $X$ with open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $U \\cap V$ is also open and simply connected. We can choose the following open sets:\n\n$U = (\\mathbb{R} \\times (-1, 1)) \\cup \\{(0, y) | y \\in [0,1] \\}$\n\n$V = ((-1, 2) \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup ((-1, 2) \\times \\{1\\}) \\cup \\{(0, y) | y \\in [0,1] \\}$\n\nNow, $U \\cap V = ((0, 1) \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup ((0, 1) \\times \\{1\\}) \\cup \\{(0, y) | y \\in [0,1] \\}$, which is simply connected.\n\nThe fundamental group of $U$ is trivial, as $U$ is simply connected. The fundamental group of $V$ is also trivial, as $V$ is homotopy equivalent to a point. The fundamental group of $U \\cap V$ is also trivial, as $U \\cap V$ is simply connected.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-Van Kampen theorem, which states that the fundamental group of $X$ is the free product of the fundamental groups of $U$ and $V$ with the normal subgroup generated by the fundamental group of $U \\cap V$:\n\n$\\pi_1(X) = \\pi_1(U) * \\pi_1(V) / N(\\pi_1(U \\cap V))$\n\nSince all the fundamental groups are trivial, we have:\n\n$\\pi_1(X) = \\{e\\}$\n\nwhere $e$ is the identity element.\n\nNow, let's find the homotopy class of a path $\\gamma(s)$ such that $\\gamma(0) = \\gamma_0(0)$ and $\\gamma(1) = \\gamma_1(1)$. Since the fundamental group of $X$ is trivial, any two paths with the same endpoints are homotopic. Therefore, we can choose any path $\\gamma(s)$ connecting $\\gamma_0(0)$ and $\\gamma_1(1)$, and it will be homotopic to both $\\gamma_0(s)$ and $\\gamma_1(s)$. One possible choice is:\n\n$\\gamma(s) = (s, s)$ for $s \\in [0,1]$\n\nThis path connects $\\gamma_0(0)$ and $\\gamma_1(1)$, and it lies within the space $X$. Since the fundamental group of $X$ is trivial, this path is homotopic to both $\\gamma_0(s)$ and $\\gamma_1(s)$."
