    "message_1": "A circular garden has a radius of 5 meters. What is the circumference of the garden in meters?",
    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 meters. So, the circumference (C) can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = 2π(5)\nC = 10π\n\nThe circumference of the garden is 10π meters, which is approximately 31.42 meters."
