    "message_2": "To minimize the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function by setting its derivative equal to zero. \n\nThe derivative of f(x) is:\nf'(x) = 2x - 2\n\nSetting f'(x) = 0, we get:\n2x - 2 = 0\nx = 1\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method to find the approximations of the root of f'(x). The Newton's method formula is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nThe second derivative of f(x) is:\nf''(x) = 2\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method with the initial guess x_0 = 1:\n\n1. First approximation (x_1):\nx_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0)\nx_1 = 1 - (2(1) - 2) / 2\nx_1 = 1\n\n2. Second approximation (x_2):\nx_2 = x_1 - f'(x_1) / f''(x_1)\nx_2 = 1 - (2(1) - 2) / 2\nx_2 = 1\n\n3. Third approximation (x_3):\nx_3 = x_2 - f'(x_2) / f''(x_2)\nx_3 = 1 - (2(1) - 2) / 2\nx_3 = 1\n\nSince the approximations are not changing, we have found the minimum point of the function f(x) at x = 1."
