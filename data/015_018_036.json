    "message_1": "A Duffing oscillator is described by the differential equation:\n\n$\\ddot{x} + 2\\gamma\\dot{x} + (\\alpha x + \\beta x^3) = \\gamma \\cos(\\omega t)$\n\nwhere $\\alpha = -1$, $\\beta = 1$, $\\gamma = 0.3$, and $\\omega = 1.2$. If $x(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 0.4$, find the maximum amplitude of the oscillations of $x(t)$ over the interval $t \\in [0, 50]$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first rewrite the given Duffing oscillator differential equation with the given values of $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, and $\\omega$:\n\n$\\ddot{x} + 2(0.3)\\dot{x} - (x - x^3) = 0.3 \\cos(1.2t)$\n\nNow, we have the initial conditions $x(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 0.4$. We will use a numerical method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve this second-order differential equation. To do this, we will first convert the second-order differential equation into two first-order differential equations:\n\nLet $y_1 = x$ and $y_2 = \\dot{x}$, then we have:\n\n$\\dot{y_1} = y_2$\n\n$\\dot{y_2} = -2(0.3)y_2 + (y_1 - y_1^3) - 0.3 \\cos(1.2t)$\n\nNow, we have two first-order differential equations with initial conditions $y_1(0) = 0$ and $y_2(0) = 0.4$. We will use the Runge-Kutta method to solve these equations over the interval $t \\in [0, 50]$.\n\nAfter solving the equations numerically, we can find the maximum amplitude of the oscillations of $x(t) = y_1(t)$ over the given interval. The maximum amplitude is the maximum absolute value of $y_1(t)$ in the interval $t \\in [0, 50]$.\n\nNote: The actual numerical solution and finding the maximum amplitude require a numerical solver, which cannot be done analytically here. You can use software like MATLAB, Python, or Mathematica to perform the numerical integration and find the maximum amplitude."
