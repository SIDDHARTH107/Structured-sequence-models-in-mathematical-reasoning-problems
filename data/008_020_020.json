    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into an upper triangular matrix, and then use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system of equations:\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 | 7 |\n| 2 -1  4 | 4 |\n| 1  3  2 | 1 |\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate x from the second and third rows:\n\nRow2 = Row2 - 2 * Row1\nRow3 = Row3 - Row1\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 |  7 |\n| 0 -5 -2 | -10|\n| 0  1 -1 | -6 |\n```\n\nStep 3: Eliminate y from the third row:\n\nRow3 = Row3 + (1/5) * Row2\n\n```\n| 1  2  3 |  7 |\n| 0 -5 -2 | -10|\n| 0  0 -3 | -12|\n```\n\nStep 4: Use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = (-12) / (-3) = 4\n\ny = (-10 + 2 * z) / (-5) = (-10 + 8) / (-5) = -2 / (-5) = 2 / 5\n\nx = 7 - 2y - 3z = 7 - 4 - 12 = -9\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -9, y = 2/5, and z = 4."
