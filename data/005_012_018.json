The mean GPA of the sample is 3.5 with a standard deviation of 0.8. What is the 95% confidence interval for the estimate of the average GPA of all students?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the estimate of the average GPA of all students, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (3.5)\nZ = Z-score for the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence)\nσ = sample standard deviation (0.8)\nn = sample size (50)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n\nSE = 0.8 / √50\nSE ≈ 0.113\n\nNext, we will find the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE\nME = 1.96 * 0.113\nME ≈ 0.221\n\nFinally, we will calculate the confidence interval:\n\nCI = x̄ ± ME\nCI = 3.5 ± 0.221\n\nLower limit of CI = 3.5 - 0.221 = 3.279\nUpper limit of CI = 3.5 + 0.221 = 3.721\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the estimate of the average GPA of all students is approximately (3.279, 3.721)."
