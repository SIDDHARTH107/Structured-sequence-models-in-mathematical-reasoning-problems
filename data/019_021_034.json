    "message_1": "Suppose two companies, A and B, are competing to win a contract. Both companies are allowed to bid with a price for the contract. The company with the lowest bid wins the contract and earns a profit equal to the bid amount minus the cost of production. If both companies bid the same amount then they will share the contract winning equally.\n\nCompany A can produce the contract at a cost of 5000 dollars while Company B can produce the contract at a cost of 6000 dollars. Company A can either bid 8000 dollars, 9000 dollars or 10000 dollars while Company B can either bid 7500 dollars, 8500 dollars or 11000 dollars. Determine what will be the bid of each company and how much profit each company will make in each case.",
    "message_2": "We will analyze each possible combination of bids and calculate the profits for each company.\n\nCase 1: Company A bids 8000 dollars, Company B bids 7500 dollars.\nIn this case, Company B wins the contract with the lowest bid. \nProfit for Company A: 0 dollars\nProfit for Company B: 7500 - 6000 = 1500 dollars\n\nCase 2: Company A bids 8000 dollars, Company B bids 8500 dollars.\nIn this case, Company A wins the contract with the lowest bid.\nProfit for Company A: 8000 - 5000 = 3000 dollars\nProfit for Company B: 0 dollars\n\nCase 3: Company A bids 8000 dollars, Company B bids 11000 dollars.\nIn this case, Company A wins the contract with the lowest bid.\nProfit for Company A: 8000 - 5000 = 3000 dollars\nProfit for Company B: 0 dollars\n\nCase 4: Company A bids 9000 dollars, Company B bids 7500 dollars.\nIn this case, Company B wins the contract with the lowest bid.\nProfit for Company A: 0 dollars\nProfit for Company B: 7500 - 6000 = 1500 dollars\n\nCase 5: Company A bids 9000 dollars, Company B bids 8500 dollars.\nIn this case, Company B wins the contract with the lowest bid.\nProfit for Company A: 0 dollars\nProfit for Company B: 8500 - 6000 = 2500 dollars\n\nCase 6: Company A bids 9000 dollars, Company B bids 11000 dollars.\nIn this case, Company A wins the contract with the lowest bid.\nProfit for Company A: 9000 - 5000 = 4000 dollars\nProfit for Company B: 0 dollars\n\nCase 7: Company A bids 10000 dollars, Company B bids 7500 dollars.\nIn this case, Company B wins the contract with the lowest bid.\nProfit for Company A: 0 dollars\nProfit for Company B: 7500 - 6000 = 1500 dollars\n\nCase 8: Company A bids 10000 dollars, Company B bids 8500 dollars.\nIn this case, Company B wins the contract with the lowest bid.\nProfit for Company A: 0 dollars\nProfit for Company B: 8500 - 6000 = 2500 dollars\n\nCase 9: Company A bids 10000 dollars, Company B bids 11000 dollars.\nIn this case, Company A wins the contract with the lowest bid.\nProfit for Company A: 10000 - 5000 = 5000 dollars\nProfit for Company B: 0 dollars\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that the best strategy for Company A is to bid 10000 dollars, which would result in a profit of 5000 dollars. The best strategy for Company B is to bid 8500 dollars, which would result in a profit of 2500 dollars."
