    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by recursively filling the interstices between mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. The order of an Apollonian gasket refers to the number of times this process is repeated.\n\nIn the initial configuration, there are 3 mutually tangent circles. At each step, a new circle is added to each interstice between the existing circles. The number of new circles added at each step follows the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... (powers of 2).\n\nTo find the total number of circles in an Apollonian gasket of order 5, we need to sum the number of circles added at each step, plus the initial 3 circles:\n\n3 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 3 + 31 = 34\n\nSo, there are 34 circles in an Apollonian gasket of order 5 with an initial configuration of three mutually tangent circles."
