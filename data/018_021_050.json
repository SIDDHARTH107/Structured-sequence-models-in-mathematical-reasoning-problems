    "message_2": "Step 1: Find the symmetric difference of A and B (A △ B)\nThe symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, (A △ B) = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nA = {1, 2, 4}\nB = {2, 4, 5}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 4, 5} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {2, 4} (intersection of A and B)\n\nNow, we subtract the intersection from the union:\n(A △ B) = {1, 2, 4, 5} - {2, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nStep 2: Find the intersection of (A △ B) and {2, 3, 4}\nNow we need to find the intersection of the symmetric difference we found in step 1 and the set {2, 3, 4}.\n\n(A △ B) = {1, 5}\n{2, 3, 4}\n\n(A △ B) ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {} (empty set)\n\nSo, the value of (A △ B) ∩ {2, 3, 4} is the empty set.\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection using set theory.\n\nLet A, B, and C be any three sets. We want to show that (A △ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) △ (B ∩ C).\n\nRecall that A △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B). So, we can rewrite the left side of the equation as:\n\n((A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)) ∩ C\n\nNow, we can use the distributive property of intersection over union and difference:\n\n(A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C) - (A ∩ B ∩ C)\n\nNow, we can rewrite this expression as a symmetric difference:\n\n(A ∩ C) △ (B ∩ C)\n\nSo, we have shown that (A △ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) △ (B ∩ C), proving that the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection."
