    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defective units,\n- n is the total number of units produced,\n- x is the number of defective units,\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time (n! / (x!(n-x)!)),\n- p is the probability of producing a defective unit, and\n- (1-p) is the probability of producing a non-defective unit.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 500 units per day * 5 working days = 2500 units,\n- x = 25 defective units,\n- p = 0.05.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\n1. Calculate nCx:\nnCx = 2500! / (25!(2500-25)!)\nnCx ≈ 1.9079 * 10^40 (using a calculator or software to compute the factorial)\n\n2. Calculate p^x:\np^x = (0.05)^25 ≈ 9.3132 * 10^(-34)\n\n3. Calculate (1-p)^(n-x):\n(1-p)^(n-x) = (0.95)^(2500-25) ≈ 1.7987 * 10^(-6)\n\n4. Calculate P(x):\nP(x) = nCx * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\nP(x) ≈ 1.9079 * 10^40 * 9.3132 * 10^(-34) * 1.7987 * 10^(-6)\nP(x) ≈ 0.0313\n\nSo, the probability of producing exactly 25 defective units in a given week (5 working days) is approximately 0.0313 or 3.13%."
