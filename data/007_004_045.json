    "message_2": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60 and 84, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n1. Divide the larger number (84) by the smaller number (60) and find the remainder.\n   84 รท 60 = 1 with a remainder of 24.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (84) with the smaller number (60), and the smaller number with the remainder (24).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 60 and 24.\n\n3. Divide the larger number (60) by the smaller number (24) and find the remainder.\n   60 รท 24 = 2 with a remainder of 12.\n\n4. Replace the larger number (60) with the smaller number (24), and the smaller number with the remainder (12).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 24 and 12.\n\n5. Divide the larger number (24) by the smaller number (12) and find the remainder.\n   24 รท 12 = 2 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12. So, the GCD of 60 and 84 is 12."
