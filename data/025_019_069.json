    "message_2": "To find the number of lines contained in the Fano variety given by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$, we can use the following approach:\n\nFirst, note that the given equation is homogeneous, which means that it defines a projective variety in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. Now, let's consider a line in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ given by the equation $ax + by + cz = 0$, where $a, b, c$ are constants.\n\nWe want to find the number of lines that are contained in the Fano variety, which means that the line must satisfy the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$. Substituting the line equation into the Fano variety equation, we get:\n\n$(ax)^3 + (by)^3 + (cz)^3 = 0$\n\nNow, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\n$a^3x^3 + b^3y^3 + c^3z^3 = 0$\n\nSince the line equation is homogeneous, we can scale $a, b, c$ such that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 0$. Now, we can rewrite the Fano variety equation as:\n\n$(a^3 + b^3 + c^3)(x^3 + y^3 + z^3) = 0$\n\nSince $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 0$, this equation is satisfied for any $x, y, z$. Therefore, any line with coefficients $a, b, c$ satisfying $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 0$ is contained in the Fano variety.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of such lines. We can use the projective transformation to set $a = 1$, $b = \\omega$, and $c = \\omega^2$, where $\\omega$ is a cube root of unity. Then, we have:\n\n$1^3 + \\omega^3 + (\\omega^2)^3 = 0$\n\nSince $\\omega^3 = 1$, this equation is satisfied. Therefore, there are three lines corresponding to the three cube roots of unity, which are $1$, $\\omega$, and $\\omega^2$.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 3 lines contained in the Fano variety given by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$."
