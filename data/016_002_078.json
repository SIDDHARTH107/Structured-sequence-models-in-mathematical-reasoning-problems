    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake curve is a fractal that is formed by successively adding smaller equilateral triangles to the sides of an initial equilateral triangle. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the curve is multiplied by 4/3, as each side of the initial triangle is replaced by a curve with 4 segments, each 1/3 the length of the original side. With each subsequent iteration, the length of the curve is again multiplied by 4/3.\n\nTo find the length of the Koch snowflake curve after the fourth iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (4/3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the fourth iteration (n = 4):\n\nLength = 1 * (4/3)^4\nLength ≈ 1 * 2.37037\nLength ≈ 2.37037 units\n\nSo, the length of the Koch snowflake curve after the fourth iteration is approximately 2.37037 units."
