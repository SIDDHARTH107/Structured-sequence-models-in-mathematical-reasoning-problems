    "message_1": "A boy standing on the top of a building observes a car at an angle of depression of 35°. If the boy is 60 meters above the ground, what is the horizontal distance between the car and the foot of the building? Find the answer correct to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The angle of depression is the same as the angle of elevation from the car to the boy. Let's call this angle θ, which is 35°. Let's call the horizontal distance between the car and the foot of the building x, and the vertical distance (height of the building) 60 meters.\n\nWe have:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(35°) = 60 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 60 / tan(35°)\nx ≈ 60 / 0.70021\nx ≈ 85.71\n\nSo, the horizontal distance between the car and the foot of the building is approximately 85.71 meters, correct to two decimal places."
