    "message_2": "To find all possible subgroups of a group G of order 24, we first note that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Thus, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. We will now analyze each case.\n\n1. Order 1: The trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element.\n\n2. Order 2: Subgroups of order 2 are generated by elements of order 2. By Cauchy's theorem, G has at least one element of order 2, so there is at least one subgroup of order 2.\n\n3. Order 3: Subgroups of order 3 are generated by elements of order 3. By Cauchy's theorem, G has at least one element of order 3, so there is at least one subgroup of order 3.\n\n4. Order 4: Subgroups of order 4 can be isomorphic to either C4 (cyclic group) or V4 (Klein-4 group). G may or may not have subgroups of order 4.\n\n5. Order 6: Subgroups of order 6 can be isomorphic to either C6 (cyclic group) or S3 (symmetric group). G may or may not have subgroups of order 6.\n\n6. Order 8: Subgroups of order 8 can be isomorphic to C8, Q8 (quaternion group), or D4 (dihedral group). G may or may not have subgroups of order 8.\n\n7. Order 12: Subgroups of order 12 can be isomorphic to C12, A4 (alternating group), or D6 (dihedral group). G may or may not have subgroups of order 12.\n\n8. Order 24: The group G itself.\n\nNow, we will show that the only groups of order 24 that have subgroups of order 12 are isomorphic to either the cyclic group C24, the alternating group A5, or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24.\n\n1. C24: The cyclic group of order 24 has a subgroup of order 12, namely the subgroup generated by an element of order 12.\n\n2. A5: The alternating group A5 has order 60, not 24, so it is not a candidate.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 24: There are five non-abelian groups of order 24, which are the semidirect products of C4 and S3, C2 and A4, C8 and C3, C4 and C6, and C2 and D6. Each of these groups has a subgroup of order 12.\n\nIn conclusion, the only groups of order 24 that have subgroups of order 12 are isomorphic to either the cyclic group C24 or one of the five non-abelian groups of order 24."
