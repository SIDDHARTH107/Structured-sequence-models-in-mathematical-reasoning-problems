    "message_1": "A thin rod of length L is heated up to a constant temperature on one end and kept at the temperature 0 on the other end. The rod is insulated, hence the heat can only travel through the rod via diffusion. The temperature of the rod is described by the diffusion equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = D∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature at a distance x away from the heated end and time t, and D is the thermal diffusivity constant of the rod.\n\nSuppose that D = 3, L = 10, and the initial temperature is 0 everywhere except at the heated end where it is 100. What is the temperature distribution on the rod after 20 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the solution to the diffusion equation with the given boundary and initial conditions. The boundary conditions are:\n\nu(0, t) = 100 (heated end)\nu(L, t) = 0 (other end)\n\nThe initial condition is:\n\nu(x, 0) = 0 for 0 < x < L\n\nWe can solve the diffusion equation using separation of variables. Let u(x, t) = X(x)T(t). Substituting this into the diffusion equation, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 3X''(x)T(t)\n\nDividing both sides by 3XT, we get:\n\nT'(t) / (3T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\nT'(t) / (3T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\nT'(t) + 3λ²T(t) = 0\n\nThe first equation is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions X(0) = 100 and X(L) = 0. The general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0) = 100 => A = 100\nX(L) = 100*cos(λL) + B*sin(λL) = 0\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, we have B = 0. Therefore, X(x) = 100*cos(λx). To satisfy the second boundary condition, we must have:\n\n100*cos(λL) = 0 => cos(λL) = 0\n\nThis implies that λL = (2n + 1)π/2 for n = 0, 1, 2, ... . Thus, λ_n = (2n + 1)π/(2L) and X_n(x) = 100*cos(λ_n*x).\n\nNow, we solve the second ODE:\n\nT'(t) + 3λ²T(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its general solution is:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-3λ²t)\n\nThe overall solution is a linear combination of the product of X_n(x) and T_n(t):\n\nu(x, t) = Σ C_n * exp(-3λ_n²t) * cos(λ_n*x)\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = 0 for 0 < x < L:\n\n0 = Σ C_n * cos(λ_n*x)\n\nThis is a Fourier cosine series, and we can find the coefficients C_n by using the orthogonality property of cosine functions:\n\nC_n = (2/L) * ∫[0, L] 100*cos(λ_n*x) dx\n\nCalculating the integral, we get:\n\nC_n = (200/λ_n) * (1 - (-1)^n) / π\n\nNow we have the temperature distribution on the rod after 20 seconds:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [(200/λ_n) * (1 - (-1)^n) / π] * exp(-3λ_n²t) * cos(λ_n*x)\n\nPlugging in the values D = 3, L = 10, and t = 20, we can compute the temperature distribution u(x, 20) for any position x along the rod. Note that this is an infinite series, so you would need to truncate it to a finite number of terms to obtain an approximate solution."
