    "message_1": "A town currently has a population of 10,000 people and the population is growing continuously at a rate of 2% per year. How many people will there be in the town after 5 years using the exponential growth model?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the exponential growth formula:\n\nFinal Population = Initial Population * (1 + Growth Rate) ^ Number of Years\n\nIn this case, the initial population is 10,000, the growth rate is 2% (0.02 as a decimal), and the number of years is 5.\n\nFinal Population = 10,000 * (1 + 0.02) ^ 5\n\nFinal Population = 10,000 * (1.02) ^ 5\n\nFinal Population = 10,000 * 1.10408 (rounded to 5 decimal places)\n\nFinal Population = 11,040.8\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a person, we can round the final population to the nearest whole number.\n\nFinal Population â‰ˆ 11,041\n\nSo, after 5 years, there will be approximately 11,041 people in the town."
