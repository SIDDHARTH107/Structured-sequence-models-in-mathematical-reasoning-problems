    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to this system of nonlinear equations, we first need to find the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 5 and g(x, y) = x*y + x - y - 1. The Jacobian matrix J is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | ∂f/∂x  ∂f/∂y |\n          | ∂g/∂x  ∂g/∂y |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\nJ(x, y) = | 2x  2y |\n          | y+1 -x-1 |\n\nNow, we will apply Newton's method iteratively using the initial approximation (x0, y0) = (2, 3). The iteration formula for Newton's method for systems of equations is:\n\n(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_n, y_n) - J(x_n, y_n)^(-1) * F(x_n, y_n)\n\nwhere F(x, y) = (f(x, y), g(x, y)) and J(x_n, y_n)^(-1) is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at (x_n, y_n).\n\nLet's perform the iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nInitial approximation: (x0, y0) = (2, 3)\nJ(x0, y0) = |  4  6 |\n            |  4 -3 |\nF(x0, y0) = (2, 4)\n\nJ(x0, y0)^(-1) = | -1/12  1/8  |\n                |  2/3  -1/6  |\n\nJ(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0) = (-1/3, 1/3)\n\n(x1, y1) = (x0, y0) - J(x0, y0)^(-1) * F(x0, y0) = (2 - (-1/3), 3 - 1/3) = (7/3, 8/3)\n\nIteration 2:\n(x1, y1) = (7/3, 8/3)\nJ(x1, y1) = | 14/3  16/3 |\n            | 11/3 -10/3 |\nF(x1, y1) = (-1/9, 2/9)\n\nJ(x1, y1)^(-1) = | -5/8  4/7  |\n                | 11/8 -7/7  |\n\nJ(x1, y1)^(-1) * F(x1, y1) = (1/63, -1/63)\n\n(x2, y2) = (x1, y1) - J(x1, y1)^(-1) * F(x1, y1) = (7/3 - 1/63, 8/3 + 1/63) = (134/63, 161/63)\n\nAt this point, the change in the approximations is less than 0.0001, so we can stop the iterations. The solution to the system of equations accurate to within 0.0001 is approximately (x, y) = (134/63, 161/63)."
