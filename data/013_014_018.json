    "message_1": "Consider a sealed-bid auction where two bidders, A and B, are interested in buying a painting. Bidder A values the painting at $800 and bidder B values it at $500. The auction is a second-price sealed-bid auction, which means that the highest bidder wins the painting but only pays the second-highest bid. Assume that both bidders bid their true valuations. What is the expected revenue of the auctioneer?",
    "message_2": "In a second-price sealed-bid auction, the highest bidder wins the painting and pays the second-highest bid. Since both bidders bid their true valuations, Bidder A will bid $800, and Bidder B will bid $500.\n\nBidder A has the highest bid and will win the painting. The auctioneer's revenue will be the second-highest bid, which is Bidder B's bid of $500. Therefore, the expected revenue of the auctioneer is $500."
