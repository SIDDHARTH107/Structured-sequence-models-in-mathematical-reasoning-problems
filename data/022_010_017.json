    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series representation of f(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z - 3i) centered at z = 2i, we first rewrite the function in terms of w = z - 2i. So, let w = z - 2i, then z = w + 2i. Now, substitute this expression for z into the function:\n\nf(w) = ((w + 2i)^2 + 1) / ((w + 2i) - 3i)\n\nf(w) = (w^2 + 4iw - 3) / (w - i)\n\nNow, we want to find the Laurent series representation of f(w) centered at w = 0. To do this, we can use partial fraction decomposition to rewrite f(w) as the sum of simpler functions that have known Laurent series expansions.\n\nf(w) = A / (w - i) + B / w\n\nTo find A and B, we can clear the denominators:\n\nf(w) * (w(w - i)) = A * w + B * (w - i)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in values of w that will eliminate one of the terms. Let's start with w = 0:\n\nf(0) = (-3) / (-i) = 3i\n\nA * 0 + B * (-i) = 3i\n\nB = -3\n\nNow, let's find A by setting w = i:\n\nf(i) = (i^2 + 4i^2 - 3) / (i - i) = (2i - 3) / 0\n\nThis is undefined, so we need to find another way to find A. Let's go back to the equation we derived earlier:\n\nf(w) * (w(w - i)) = A * w + B * (w - i)\n\nNow, let's plug in B = -3:\n\nf(w) * (w(w - i)) = A * w - 3 * (w - i)\n\nNow, let's set w = i:\n\nf(i) * (i(i - i)) = A * i - 3 * (i - i)\n\nf(i) * 0 = A * i\n\nSince f(i) is undefined, we can't use this method to find A. Instead, let's go back to the original equation and rearrange it:\n\nA * w + B * (w - i) = f(w) * (w(w - i))\n\nA * w + (-3) * (w - i) = f(w) * (w(w - i))\n\nA * w - 3w + 3i = f(w) * (w(w - i))\n\nNow, let's look at the imaginary part of the equation:\n\n3i = Im(f(w) * (w(w - i)))\n\nSince f(w) = (w^2 + 4iw - 3) / (w - i), we can write the imaginary part of f(w) as:\n\nIm(f(w)) = 4w / (w - i)\n\nNow, let's plug this back into the equation:\n\n3i = (4w / (w - i)) * Im(w(w - i))\n\nTo find the imaginary part of w(w - i), we can expand the product:\n\nw(w - i) = w^2 - iw\n\nIm(w(w - i)) = -w\n\nNow, let's plug this back into the equation:\n\n3i = (4w / (w - i)) * (-w)\n\n3i = -4w^2 / (w - i)\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides by (w - i):\n\n3i(w - i) = -4w^2\n\n3wi - 3i^2 = -4w^2\n\n3wi + 3 = -4w^2\n\nNow, let's look at the real part of the equation:\n\n3 = -4w^2\n\nw^2 = -3/4\n\nSince w = z - 2i, we can write this as:\n\n(z - 2i)^2 = -3/4\n\nNow, let's find the set of values of z for which the series converges. The series converges when the magnitude of (z - 2i)^2 is greater than -3/4:\n\n|(z - 2i)^2| > |-3/4|\n\nSince the left side of the inequality is always non-negative, the inequality is satisfied for all z in the complex plane except for z = 2i, where the magnitude of (z - 2i)^2 is equal to 0. Therefore, the series converges for all z â‰  2i."
