    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-2}$ along a path starting at $z_0=1$ and ending at $z_1=3$, we first need to identify if there are any singularities in the function. In this case, there is a simple pole at $z=2$. \n\nSince the path from $z_0=1$ to $z_1=3$ passes through the singularity at $z=2$, we need to find an alternative representation of the function that is analytic in a region containing the path. One way to do this is to use a Laurent series expansion around the singularity.\n\nLet's rewrite the function $f(z)$ as follows:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-2} = -\\frac{1}{2-z}$$\n\nNow, let's find the Laurent series expansion of $f(z)$ around $z=2$. We can use the geometric series formula:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1-w} = 1 + w + w^2 + w^3 + \\cdots$$\n\nwhere $|w| < 1$. In our case, we want to find a series representation for $-\\frac{1}{2-z}$, so we can set $w = z-2$:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{2-z} = -\\left(1 + (z-2) + (z-2)^2 + (z-2)^3 + \\cdots\\right)$$\n\nThis series converges for $|z-2| < 1$. Since the path from $z_0=1$ to $z_1=3$ lies within this region, we can use this series representation as the analytic continuation of $f(z)$ along the path:\n\n$$f(z) = -\\left(1 + (z-2) + (z-2)^2 + (z-2)^3 + \\cdots\\right)$$\n\nSo, the analytic continuation of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z-2}$ along the path from $z_0=1$ to $z_1=3$ is given by the above Laurent series expansion."
