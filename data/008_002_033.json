    "message_2": "To find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix A = [[a, b], [c, d]], we can use the following formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1 / det(A)) * [[d, -b], [-c, a]]\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of A, which is calculated as (ad - bc).\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (8 * 7) - (2 * 3) = 56 - 6 = 50\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of A:\n\nA^(-1) = (1 / 50) * [[7, -2], [-3, 8]]\n\nA^(-1) = [[0.14, -0.04], [-0.06, 0.16]]\n\nSo, the inverse of the matrix A = [[8, 2], [3, 7]] is A^(-1) = [[0.14, -0.04], [-0.06, 0.16]]."
