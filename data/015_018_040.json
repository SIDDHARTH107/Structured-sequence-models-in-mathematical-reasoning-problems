    "message_2": "To find the amplitude of the oscillation after 100 seconds, we need to solve the given differential equation numerically with the given initial conditions and parameters. This can be done using numerical methods like the Runge-Kutta method or by using software like MATLAB or Python.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I cannot perform numerical simulations directly. I can guide you through the process of solving the problem using Python.\n\nFirst, you need to install the necessary libraries:\n\n```python\npip install numpy\npip install scipy\npip install matplotlib\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the Duffing oscillator equation\ndef duffing_oscillator(t, y, delta, alpha, beta, gamma, omega):\n    x, v = y\n    dxdt = v\n    dvdt = -delta * v - alpha * x - beta * x**3 + gamma * np.cos(omega * t)\n    return [dxdt, dvdt]\n\n# Parameters\ndelta = 0.2\nalpha = -1.0\nbeta = 1.0\ngamma = 0.3\nomega = 1.2\n\n# Initial conditions\nx0 = 0\nv0 = 0\n\n# Time span\nt_span = (0, 100)\n\n# Time steps\nt_eval = np.linspace(0, 100, 10000)\n\n# Solve the differential equation\nsol = solve_ivp(duffing_oscillator, t_span, [x0, v0], args=(delta, alpha, beta, gamma, omega), t_eval=t_eval)\n\n# Plot the solution\nplt.plot(sol.t, sol.y[0])\nplt.xlabel('Time (s)')\nplt.ylabel('Amplitude')\nplt.title('Duffing Oscillator')\nplt.show()\n\n# Find the amplitude after 100 seconds\namplitude = np.max(sol.y[0][-1000:])\nprint(f\"Amplitude after 100 seconds: {amplitude:.4f}\")\n```\n\nThis code will solve the Duffing oscillator equation with the given parameters and initial conditions, plot the solution, and print the amplitude after 100 seconds. Note that the amplitude may vary slightly depending on the numerical method and time steps used."
