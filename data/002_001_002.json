    "message_1": "What is the area of a triangle when its base is 8 cm and height is 12 cm?",
    "message_2": "The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 * 12) / 2\nArea = 96 / 2\nArea = 48 cmÂ²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 48 square centimeters."
