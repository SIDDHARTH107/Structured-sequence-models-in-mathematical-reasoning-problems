The group of points on this curve is {(0, ±0), (1, ±2), (2, ±1), (3, ±1), (4, ±4), ∞}. What is the order of this group?",
    "message_2": "The order of the group of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field is the number of points in the group, including the point at infinity. In this example, the group of points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 3 over the finite field F_5 is:\n\n{(0, ±0), (1, ±2), (2, ±1), (3, ±1), (4, ±4), ∞}\n\nTo find the order, we count the number of distinct points in the group:\n\n1. (0, 0) - one point (since ±0 is just 0)\n2. (1, 2) and (1, -2) - two points (since -2 is equivalent to 3 in F_5)\n3. (2, 1) and (2, -1) - two points (since -1 is equivalent to 4 in F_5)\n4. (3, 1) and (3, -1) - two points (since -1 is equivalent to 4 in F_5)\n5. (4, 4) and (4, -4) - two points (since -4 is equivalent to 1 in F_5)\n6. ∞ - one point\n\nAdding these up, we get a total of 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10 points. Therefore, the order of the group of points on this elliptic curve over the finite field F_5 is 10."
