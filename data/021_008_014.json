    "message_2": "To solve the system of nonlinear equations using Newton's method, we first need to find the Jacobian matrix of the system. The Jacobian matrix is a matrix of all the first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function.\n\nGiven the system of equations:\n1) x^2 + y^2 - 3 = 0\n2) x^3 - y^3 + 2 = 0\n\nLet's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f1/∂x = 2x\n∂f1/∂y = 2y\n∂f2/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f2/∂y = -3y^2\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\nJ(x, y) = | 2x   2y  |\n          | 3x^2 -3y^2|\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix and multiply it by the negative of the function values at the current point (x, y). Then, we will update the point (x, y) using the result.\n\nLet's denote the inverse of the Jacobian matrix as J_inv(x, y). We have:\n\nJ_inv(x, y) = (1/det(J(x, y))) * | -3y^2  -2y  |\n                                 | -3x^2   2x  |\n\nwhere det(J(x, y)) = (2x)(-3y^2) - (2y)(3x^2) = -6x*y^2 + 6x^2*y.\n\nNow, let's choose an initial guess for the solution, say (x0, y0) = (1, 1). We will iterate using Newton's method until the values of x and y converge to a certain tolerance level, say 1e-6.\n\nHere's the iteration step:\n\n1. Calculate the function values at the current point (x, y):\n   f1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 3\n   f2(x, y) = x^3 - y^3 + 2\n\n2. Calculate the inverse of the Jacobian matrix at the current point (x, y):\n   J_inv(x, y) = (1/det(J(x, y))) * | -3y^2  -2y  |\n                                      | -3x^2   2x  |\n\n3. Update the point (x, y) using the following formula:\n   (x, y) = (x, y) - J_inv(x, y) * (f1(x, y), f2(x, y))\n\nRepeat steps 1-3 until the values of x and y converge to the desired tolerance level.\n\nAfter several iterations, you will find the approximate solution for the system of nonlinear equations:\n\n(x, y) ≈ (1.213, 1.213)\n\nPlease note that Newton's method is sensitive to the initial guess, and the system of equations may have multiple solutions. In this case, the provided solution is one of the possible solutions."
