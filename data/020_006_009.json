    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products - Product A and Product B. Each product requires a certain amount of two raw materials: Material X and Material Y. The company has 50 units of Material X and 60 units of Material Y available per day. \n\nThe profit margins for Product A and Product B are $20 and $30 per unit respectively. The company wants to maximize its daily profit by determining the number of units of each product to produce. However, the production of Product A requires 2 units of Material X and 3 units of Material Y, while the production of Product B requires 4 units of Material X and 2 units of Material Y. \n\nWhat is the maximum daily profit the company can make, and how many units of each product should it produce to achieve this?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for the raw materials are:\n2x + 4y ≤ 50 (Material X)\n3x + 2y ≤ 60 (Material Y)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 20x + 30y\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method or the simplex method. In this case, we will use the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 50\n   y ≤ (50 - 2x) / 4\n   y ≤ 25 - 0.5x\n\n2. 3x + 2y ≤ 60\n   y ≤ (60 - 3x) / 2\n   y ≤ 30 - 1.5x\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0,0), (0,25), (20,0), and (10,15).\n\nNow we need to evaluate the objective function P = 20x + 30y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. P(0,25) = 20(0) + 30(25) = $750\n3. P(20,0) = 20(20) + 30(0) = $400\n4. P(10,15) = 20(10) + 30(15) = $650\n\nThe maximum daily profit is $750, which is achieved when the company produces 0 units of Product A and 25 units of Product B."
