    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 10 cm, a width of 8 cm, and a height of 6 cm. What is the surface area of this prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The area of the first pair of opposite faces (length × width): 10 cm × 8 cm = 80 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 2 × 80 cm² = 160 cm².\n\n2. The area of the second pair of opposite faces (length × height): 10 cm × 6 cm = 60 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 2 × 60 cm² = 120 cm².\n\n3. The area of the third pair of opposite faces (width × height): 8 cm × 6 cm = 48 cm². Since there are two of these faces, their combined area is 2 × 48 cm² = 96 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all three pairs of faces together:\n\n160 cm² + 120 cm² + 96 cm² = 376 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 376 cm²."
