    "message_2": "Let H be a subgroup of G. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of H must divide the order of G. Since the order of G is 10, the possible orders of H are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\nCase 1: Order of H is 1.\nIn this case, H = {1}, and we can choose k = 10 as the generator since a^10 = 1.\n\nCase 2: Order of H is 2.\nIn this case, H must have two elements, one of which is the identity element 1. The other element must be of order 2, which means a^k = 1 for some k. The smallest such k is 5, so H = {1, a^5}, and the generator is k = 5.\n\nCase 3: Order of H is 5.\nIn this case, H must have five elements, one of which is the identity element 1. The other elements must be of order 5, which means a^k = 1 for some k. The smallest such k is 2, so H = {1, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8}, and the generator is k = 2.\n\nCase 4: Order of H is 10.\nIn this case, H = G, and the generator is k = 1, since H = {1, a, a^2, ..., a^9}.\n\nIn conclusion, for any subgroup H of G, there exists an integer k such that H = {1, a^k, a^(2k), ..., a^(nk)}, where n is the order of H. The possible generators are k = 10, 5, 2, and 1, corresponding to the orders of H being 1, 2, 5, and 10, respectively."
