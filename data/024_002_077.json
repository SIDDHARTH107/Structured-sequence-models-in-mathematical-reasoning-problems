    "message_2": "On a spherical surface, the geodesics are the great circles, which are the circles with the same radius as the sphere and whose centers coincide with the center of the sphere. In this case, we are given that the geodesic starts at the equator and intersects the meridian at an angle of 45 degrees.\n\nLet's use spherical coordinates to describe the points on the sphere. In spherical coordinates, a point is represented by (r, θ, φ), where r is the radial distance from the origin, θ is the polar angle (measured from the positive z-axis), and φ is the azimuthal angle (measured from the positive x-axis in the xy-plane).\n\nThe equator is defined by θ = π/2, and the meridian is defined by φ = 0. Let's denote the intersection point of the geodesic and the meridian as P. Since the angle between the geodesic and the meridian at P is 45 degrees, the angle between the tangent vector of the geodesic and the meridian at P is also 45 degrees.\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of point P. Since P lies on the meridian, its azimuthal angle is φ = 0. Let's denote the polar angle of P as θ_P. The tangent vector of the geodesic at P can be represented as (dr/ds, r dθ/ds, r sin(θ) dφ/ds), where s is the arc length along the geodesic. Since the geodesic is a great circle, dr/ds = 0. Thus, the tangent vector can be simplified to (0, r dθ/ds, r sin(θ) dφ/ds).\n\nThe tangent vector of the meridian at P is (0, r dθ/ds, 0). The angle between these two tangent vectors is 45 degrees, so their dot product is equal to the product of their magnitudes times cos(45°):\n\n(0, r dθ/ds, r sin(θ) dφ/ds) · (0, r dθ/ds, 0) = |(0, r dθ/ds, r sin(θ) dφ/ds)| |(0, r dθ/ds, 0)| cos(45°)\n\n(r^2 (dθ/ds)^2) = (r^2 (dθ/ds)^2 + r^2 sin^2(θ) (dφ/ds)^2) (r^2 (dθ/ds)^2) (1/√2)\n\nSimplifying and canceling terms, we get:\n\n1 = sin^2(θ) (dφ/ds)^2 + (dθ/ds)^2\n\nSince P lies on the meridian, φ = 0, and dφ/ds = 0. Thus, (dθ/ds)^2 = 1. Integrating with respect to s, we get:\n\nθ = s + C\n\nSince the geodesic starts at the equator, θ = π/2 when s = 0. Therefore, C = π/2, and the equation for the geodesic in terms of θ is:\n\nθ = s + π/2\n\nNow, we can find the length of the geodesic curve from the equator to the intersection point P. Since P lies on the meridian, its polar angle is θ_P. The arc length s is equal to the difference in polar angles:\n\ns = θ_P - π/2\n\nFinally, to find the length of the geodesic curve in terms of the radius r, we multiply s by r:\n\nLength = r(θ_P - π/2)\n\nThis is the length of the geodesic curve from the equator to the intersection point P on the meridian, where the geodesic intersects the meridian at an angle of 45 degrees."
