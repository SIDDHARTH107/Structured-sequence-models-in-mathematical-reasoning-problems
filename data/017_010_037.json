    "message_2": "There are two isomorphism classes of groups of order 10: the cyclic group C10 and the dihedral group D5.\n\nTo see this, let G be a group of order 10. By the Sylow theorems, G has a Sylow 5-subgroup P and a Sylow 2-subgroup Q. Since 5 is prime, P is isomorphic to the cyclic group C5. Similarly, Q is isomorphic to the cyclic group C2.\n\nNow, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G divides 2 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. This means that there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup in G, which we denote by P. Since P is the only Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal in G. \n\nNow consider the action of Q on P by conjugation. Since P is normal in G, this action is well-defined. The action of Q on P induces a homomorphism from Q to the automorphism group of P, which is Aut(P) â‰… C4 (since P is isomorphic to C5 and the automorphism group of a cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to the group of units modulo n, which is C4 in this case).\n\nSince Q has order 2, the image of this homomorphism is either trivial or has order 2. If the image is trivial, then Q acts trivially on P, and G is the direct product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to C10. If the image has order 2, then there is a nontrivial automorphism of P induced by the action of an element of Q. In this case, G is a semidirect product of P and Q, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5.\n\nThus, any group of order 10 is isomorphic to either C10 or D5, and these two groups are not isomorphic to each other (since C10 is abelian and D5 is not). Therefore, there are exactly two isomorphism classes of groups of order 10: C10 and D5."
