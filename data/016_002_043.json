    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is generated by iteratively replacing each line segment with a smaller pattern. After each iteration, the length of the line segments increases by a factor of 4/3. \n\nTo find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after four iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial length * (4/3)^iterations\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 4 units, and there are 4 iterations:\n\nPerimeter = 4 * (4/3)^4\n\nPerimeter ≈ 4 * 2.37037\n\nPerimeter ≈ 9.48148 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after four iterations is approximately 9.48148 units."
