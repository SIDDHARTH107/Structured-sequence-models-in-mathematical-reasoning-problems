    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces light bulbs with a mean life of 800 hours and a standard deviation of 50 hours. A retailer receives an order of 500 of these light bulbs. What is the probability that the average lifetime of these light bulbs will be less than 795 hours?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed if the sample size is large enough. In this case, we have a large sample size of 500 light bulbs.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean, which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The formula for the standard error is:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nSE = 50 / √500 ≈ 2.236\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score, which is the number of standard errors away from the population mean that our sample mean is. The formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (X̄ - μ) / SE\n\nwhere X̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, and SE is the standard error.\n\nz = (795 - 800) / 2.236 ≈ -2.236\n\nNow, we can use a z-table or a calculator to find the probability that the average lifetime of the light bulbs will be less than 795 hours. The probability associated with a z-score of -2.236 is approximately 0.0125.\n\nSo, the probability that the average lifetime of these light bulbs will be less than 795 hours is approximately 1.25%."
