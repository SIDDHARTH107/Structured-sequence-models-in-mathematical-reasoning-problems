    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. To apply the WOA to minimize the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x + 3 subject to the constraints 0 ≤ x ≤ 5, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of whales (search agents) with random positions within the search space (0 ≤ x ≤ 5).\n\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale using the objective function f(x).\n\n3. Determine the best whale (the one with the lowest fitness value).\n\n4. Update the position of each whale using the WOA equations, which involve encircling prey, bubble-net attacking, and search for prey. The equations are as follows:\n\n   A = 2 * a * rand() - a\n   C = 2 * rand()\n   D = abs(C * X_best - X_whale)\n   X_new = X_best - A * D\n\n   where a decreases linearly from 2 to 0 over the course of the algorithm, rand() is a random number between 0 and 1, X_best is the position of the best whale, X_whale is the current position of the whale, and X_new is the updated position of the whale.\n\n5. If a whale's new position is outside the search space (0 ≤ x ≤ 5), adjust it to the nearest boundary.\n\n6. Calculate the fitness of each whale in their new positions.\n\n7. Update the best whale if a better solution is found.\n\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 for a predetermined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\n9. The position of the best whale at the end of the algorithm represents the optimal solution.\n\nIt's important to note that the WOA is a metaheuristic algorithm, which means it may not always find the exact global minimum but should provide a good approximation. To find the exact minimum of the function f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x + 3, you can use calculus methods such as taking the derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 4x + 5\n\nSetting f'(x) to zero:\n\n4x + 5 = 0\nx = -5/4\n\nHowever, this value is outside the constraint 0 ≤ x ≤ 5. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) within the constraint will occur at one of the boundaries. Evaluating f(x) at x = 0 and x = 5:\n\nf(0) = 2(0)^2 + 5(0) + 3 = 3\nf(5) = 2(5)^2 + 5(5) + 3 = 78\n\nThus, the minimum value of f(x) within the constraint is f(x) = 3 at x = 0."
