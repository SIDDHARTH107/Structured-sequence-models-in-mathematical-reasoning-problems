    "message_2": "The probability of drawing an Ace of Hearts from a shuffled deck of 52 cards is 1/52, since there is only one Ace of Hearts in the deck and 52 cards in total. To express this as a percentage, you can multiply the fraction by 100: (1/52) * 100 = 1.92%. So, the probability is approximately 1.92%."
