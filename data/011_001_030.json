    "message_1": "A group of 8 people is going to choose a president, vice-president, and treasurer. How many different ways can these positions be filled?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of permutations. There are 8 people to choose from for the position of president. Once the president is chosen, there are 7 people left to choose from for the position of vice-president. Finally, there are 6 people left to choose from for the position of treasurer.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to fill these positions is:\n\n8 (choices for president) × 7 (choices for vice-president) × 6 (choices for treasurer) = 336 different ways."
