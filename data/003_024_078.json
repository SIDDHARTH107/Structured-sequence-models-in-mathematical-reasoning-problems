    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector v onto vector w, we can use the formula:\n\nprojection_length = (v · w) / ||w||\n\nwhere v · w is the dot product of the two vectors, and ||w|| is the magnitude of vector w.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of v and w:\n\nv · w = (4 * -2) + (3 * 5) = -8 + 15 = 7\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector w:\n\n||w|| = √((-2)^2 + (5)^2) = √(4 + 25) = √29\n\nNow, we can find the length of the projection:\n\nprojection_length = (v · w) / ||w|| = 7 / √29\n\nThe length of the projection of vector v onto vector w is 7/√29."
