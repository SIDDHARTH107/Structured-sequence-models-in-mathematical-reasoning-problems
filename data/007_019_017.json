    "message_2": "To find the smallest prime factor of 7777, we can start by testing the smallest prime number, 2, and work our way up until we find a factor.\n\n7777 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. The next smallest prime number is 3.\n\n7777 รท 3 = 2593\n\nSince 7777 is divisible by 3, the smallest prime factor of 7777 is 3."
