    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA company wants to maximize their profit by minimizing their production cost. The production cost function is given by:\n\n    C(x) = 100x^2 + 5000x + 10000\n    \nwhere x represents the number of units produced.\n\nAssuming that the company can sell each unit for $5000, what is the optimal number of units they should produce in order to maximize their profit?\n\nUse the gradient descent method to find the answer, assuming an initial guess value of x=0. Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to minimize the cost function C(x) while considering the revenue function. The revenue function R(x) is given by:\n\nR(x) = 5000x\n\nThe profit function P(x) is the difference between the revenue function and the cost function:\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 5000x - (100x^2 + 5000x + 10000)\n\nSimplifying the profit function:\n\nP(x) = -100x^2 + 10000\n\nNow, we will use the gradient descent method to find the optimal number of units to produce. First, we need to find the derivative of the profit function with respect to x:\n\ndP(x)/dx = -200x\n\nWe will use the following gradient descent update rule:\n\nx_new = x_old - learning_rate * dP(x)/dx\n\nLet's assume a learning rate of 0.01 and set the initial guess value of x=0. We will iterate until the change in x is negligible (e.g., less than 0.001).\n\nIteration 1:\nx_new = 0 - 0.01 * (-200 * 0) = 0\n\nIteration 2:\nx_new = 0 - 0.01 * (-200 * 0) = 0\n\nSince the value of x is not changing, we have reached the optimal value. Therefore, the optimal number of units to produce is x = 0 (rounded to the nearest whole number). However, this result indicates that the company should not produce any units, which is not a practical solution.\n\nThe reason for this result is that the profit function is a quadratic function with a downward-opening parabola, meaning that the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola. In this case, the vertex is at x = 0, but this does not make sense in the context of the problem. It is likely that there is an error in the given cost function or revenue function, or there are additional constraints that were not provided."
