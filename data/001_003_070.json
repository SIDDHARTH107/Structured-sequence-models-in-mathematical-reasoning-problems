    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, I'll use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we'll multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same:\n\n1. Multiply the first equation by 4:\n   8x + 12y = 52\n\n2. Multiply the second equation by 3:\n   15x - 12y = -21\n\nNow, we can add the two equations to eliminate the y variable:\n\n(8x + 12y) + (15x - 12y) = 52 + (-21)\n8x + 15x = 31\n23x = 31\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 31 / 23\nx = 1\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 13\n2(1) + 3y = 13\n2 + 3y = 13\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\n3y = 11\ny = 11 / 3\n\nSo, the solution for the system of linear equations is x = 1 and y = 11/3."
