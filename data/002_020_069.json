    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector of a circle, we need to calculate the arc length and add it to the sum of the two radii.\n\nThe formula for the arc length (L) is:\n\nL = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is a constant (approximately 3.14159).\n\nGiven the radius (r) is 8 cm and the central angle (θ) is 45 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nL = (45/360) × 2π(8)\nL = (1/8) × 16π\nL = 2π\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter (P) of the sector by adding the arc length (L) to the sum of the two radii:\n\nP = L + 2r\nP = 2π + 2(8)\nP = 2π + 16\n\nSince π is approximately 3.14159, we can approximate the perimeter:\n\nP ≈ 2(3.14159) + 16\nP ≈ 6.28318 + 16\nP ≈ 22.28318 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 22.28 cm."
