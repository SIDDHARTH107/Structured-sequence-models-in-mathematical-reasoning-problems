    "message_1": "What is the probability that a network will experience a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack in a given month, if historical data shows that the likelihood of a DDoS attack occurring on that network is 0.08 per day? Round your answer to the nearest thousandth.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a DDoS attack occurring in a given month, we can use the complement probability, which is the probability of the event not occurring. \n\nLet P(A) be the probability of a DDoS attack occurring on a given day, and P(A') be the probability of a DDoS attack not occurring on a given day. We are given that P(A) = 0.08, so P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92.\n\nNow, let's assume there are 30 days in a month. The probability of a DDoS attack not occurring on any day in the month is P(A')^30. \n\nP(A')^30 = 0.92^30 ≈ 0.0294\n\nNow, we find the complement of this probability, which is the probability of a DDoS attack occurring at least once in the month.\n\nP(at least one DDoS attack) = 1 - P(no DDoS attack) = 1 - 0.0294 ≈ 0.9706\n\nSo, the probability of a network experiencing a DDoS attack in a given month is approximately 0.971 or 97.1%."
