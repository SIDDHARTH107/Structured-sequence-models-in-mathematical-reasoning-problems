    "message_1": "A box contains 4 red, 3 blue, and 2 green balls. A student selects 5 balls from the box without replacement. Find the number of ways in which this can be done if at least 3 balls are red.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will consider the different cases where the student selects at least 3 red balls:\n\nCase 1: The student selects exactly 3 red balls.\nIn this case, the student will also select 2 non-red balls (either blue or green). There are 4 red balls, so there are C(4,3) ways to choose 3 red balls. There are 5 non-red balls (3 blue and 2 green), so there are C(5,2) ways to choose 2 non-red balls. Therefore, there are C(4,3) * C(5,2) ways to select 3 red balls and 2 non-red balls.\n\nCase 2: The student selects exactly 4 red balls.\nIn this case, the student will also select 1 non-red ball (either blue or green). There are 4 red balls, so there are C(4,4) ways to choose 4 red balls. There are 5 non-red balls (3 blue and 2 green), so there are C(5,1) ways to choose 1 non-red ball. Therefore, there are C(4,4) * C(5,1) ways to select 4 red balls and 1 non-red ball.\n\nNow, we will sum the number of ways for each case to find the total number of ways to select at least 3 red balls:\n\nTotal ways = C(4,3) * C(5,2) + C(4,4) * C(5,1)\n\nUsing the formula for combinations, C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), we can compute the values:\n\nC(4,3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4\nC(5,2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10\nC(4,4) = 4! / (4!(4-4)!) = 1\nC(5,1) = 5! / (1!(5-1)!) = 5\n\nTotal ways = (4 * 10) + (1 * 5) = 40 + 5 = 45\n\nSo, there are 45 ways in which the student can select at least 3 red balls from the box."
