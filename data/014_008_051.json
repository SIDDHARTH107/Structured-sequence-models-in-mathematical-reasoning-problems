    "message_2": "A block cipher with a key size of 256 bits has 2^256 possible keys. This is because each bit can have 2 possible values (0 or 1), and there are 256 bits in the key. So, the total number of possible keys is:\n\n2^256 = 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936"
