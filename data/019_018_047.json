    "message_2": "To prove that 2 is a prime number, we need to show that it has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself (2).\n\nA prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. In other words, a prime number is a number that has only two factors: 1 and itself.\n\nLet's consider the number 2:\n\n1. The first factor of 2 is 1, as 1 multiplied by 2 equals 2 (1 * 2 = 2).\n2. The second factor of 2 is 2 itself, as 2 multiplied by 1 equals 2 (2 * 1 = 2).\n\nThere are no other natural numbers that can be multiplied together to give the product of 2. Therefore, 2 has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and 2.\n\nSince 2 meets the definition of a prime number, we can conclude that 2 is a prime number."
