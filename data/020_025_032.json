    "message_1": "A delivery company wants to deliver packages to four different locations in a city, and they want to minimize the distance traveled. The distances between the locations are: \n\n- Location 1 to Location 2: 5 km\n- Location 1 to Location 3: 10 km\n- Location 1 to Location 4: 7 km\n- Location 2 to Location 3: 8 km\n- Location 2 to Location 4: 6 km\n- Location 3 to Location 4: 3 km\n\nWhat is the optimal route that the delivery company should take to minimize the distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the brute force method to calculate the total distance for all possible routes and then choose the one with the minimum distance. There are 3! = 6 possible routes since there are 3 other locations to visit after starting at Location 1.\n\n1. Route: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4\n   Distance: 5 km (1 to 2) + 8 km (2 to 3) + 3 km (3 to 4) = 16 km\n\n2. Route: 1 → 2 → 4 → 3\n   Distance: 5 km (1 to 2) + 6 km (2 to 4) + 3 km (4 to 3) = 14 km\n\n3. Route: 1 → 3 → 2 → 4\n   Distance: 10 km (1 to 3) + 8 km (3 to 2) + 6 km (2 to 4) = 24 km\n\n4. Route: 1 → 3 → 4 → 2\n   Distance: 10 km (1 to 3) + 3 km (3 to 4) + 6 km (4 to 2) = 19 km\n\n5. Route: 1 → 4 → 2 → 3\n   Distance: 7 km (1 to 4) + 6 km (4 to 2) + 8 km (2 to 3) = 21 km\n\n6. Route: 1 → 4 → 3 → 2\n   Distance: 7 km (1 to 4) + 3 km (4 to 3) + 8 km (3 to 2) = 18 km\n\nComparing the total distances, the optimal route is 1 → 2 → 4 → 3 with a total distance of 14 km."
