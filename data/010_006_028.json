    "message_2": "First, we will prove the statement about the induced homomorphism and homotopy equivalence.\n\n(⇒) Suppose that $f_*: \\pi_1(X, x_0) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(Y, f(x_0))$ is an isomorphism for any two points $x_0, x_1$ in X. We want to show that $f$ is a homotopy equivalence. Since $Y$ is simply connected, we have $\\pi_1(Y, f(x_0)) = 0$. Thus, $\\pi_1(X, x_0) = 0$ for all $x_0 \\in X$. Since $X$ is connected, this implies that $X$ is simply connected.\n\nNow, since $f$ is a continuous map from a compact space $X$ to a Hausdorff space $Y$, it follows that $f$ is a closed map. Therefore, $f(X)$ is a compact and connected subset of $Y$. Since $Y$ is simply connected, it is also connected, and thus $f(X) = Y$. So, $f$ is a surjective map.\n\nNow, we need to find a continuous map $g: Y \\rightarrow X$ such that $g \\circ f \\simeq Id_X$ and $f \\circ g \\simeq Id_Y$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are both simply connected, we can define $g$ to be a continuous map that sends every point in $Y$ to a fixed point in $X$, say $x_0$. Then, $g \\circ f$ is homotopic to $Id_X$ and $f \\circ g$ is homotopic to $Id_Y$ by the homotopy invariance of the fundamental group. Thus, $f$ is a homotopy equivalence.\n\n(⇐) Suppose that $f$ is a homotopy equivalence. Then there exists a continuous map $g: Y \\rightarrow X$ such that $g \\circ f \\simeq Id_X$ and $f \\circ g \\simeq Id_Y$. Since $Y$ is simply connected, we have $\\pi_1(Y, f(x_0)) = 0$. We want to show that $f_*: \\pi_1(X, x_0) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(Y, f(x_0))$ is an isomorphism.\n\nConsider the composition of induced homomorphisms $(g \\circ f)_* = g_* \\circ f_*: \\pi_1(X, x_0) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(X, x_0)$. Since $g \\circ f \\simeq Id_X$, we have $(g \\circ f)_* = Id_{\\pi_1(X, x_0)}$. Similarly, $(f \\circ g)_* = Id_{\\pi_1(Y, f(x_0))}$. Thus, $f_*$ is an isomorphism.\n\nNow, let X be the unit circle $S^1$ and Y be the 2-dimensional sphere $S^2$. Consider the map $f : S^1 \\rightarrow S^2$ defined by $f(x,y,z) = (\\cos{(2\\pi x)},\\sin{(2\\pi x)}\\cos{(\\pi y)},\\sin{(2\\pi x)}\\sin{(\\pi y)})$. We want to determine whether the induced homomorphism $f_* : \\pi_{1}(S^{1}) \\rightarrow \\pi_{1}(S^{2})$ is an isomorphism or not.\n\nWe know that $\\pi_1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\pi_1(S^2) = 0$. Since $S^2$ is simply connected, the induced homomorphism $f_* : \\pi_{1}(S^{1}) \\rightarrow \\pi_{1}(S^{2})$ is the trivial homomorphism, which maps all elements of $\\pi_1(S^1)$ to the identity element in $\\pi_1(S^2)$. This homomorphism is not an isomorphism, as it is not bijective. Therefore, the induced homomorphism $f_* : \\pi_{1}(S^{1}) \\rightarrow \\pi_{1}(S^{2})$ is not an isomorphism."
