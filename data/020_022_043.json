    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, X and Y. The production process of product X requires 2 units of resource A and 1 unit of resource B, while the production process of product Y requires 1 unit of resource A and 2 units of resource B. The company has 10 units of resource A and 12 units of resource B available per day. The profit per unit of product X is $5 and for product Y is $4. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced.\n\nThe constraints for the resources are as follows:\n\n2x + y ≤ 10 (resource A constraint)\nx + 2y ≤ 12 (resource B constraint)\n\nx ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraints)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nP = 5x + 4y\n\nWe will now solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 10\ny ≤ -2x + 10\n\n2. x + 2y ≤ 12\ny ≤ -0.5x + 6\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the quadrilateral with vertices A(0,0), B(0,6), C(2,4), and D(4,0).\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function P at each vertex:\n\nA(0,0): P = 5(0) + 4(0) = $0\nB(0,6): P = 5(0) + 4(6) = $24\nC(2,4): P = 5(2) + 4(4) = $22\nD(4,0): P = 5(4) + 4(0) = $20\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex B(0,6), with a total profit of $24. Therefore, the company should produce 0 units of product X and 6 units of product Y to maximize their total profit."
