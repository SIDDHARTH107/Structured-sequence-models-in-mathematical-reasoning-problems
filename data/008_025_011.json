    "message_2": "To determine if the system of linear equations has no solutions, we can use the method of elimination or substitution to check for inconsistencies. Let's use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by -1:\n\n(1) 3(x + 2y - z) = 3(5)\n(2) -1(3x - y + 2z) = -1(7)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n(1) 3x + 6y - 3z = 15\n(2) -3x + y - 2z = -7\n\nNow, add equations (1) and (2) to eliminate x:\n\n(1) + (2): 3x + 6y - 3z - 3x + y - 2z = 15 - 7\n7y - 5z = 8\n\nNow we have a new equation:\n\n(3) 7y - 5z = 8\n\nNext, let's eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by -2 and the third equation by 1:\n\n(1) -2(x + 2y - z) = -2(5)\n(3) 1(2x + y - 3z) = 1(-4)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n(1) -2x - 4y + 2z = -10\n(3) 2x + y - 3z = -4\n\nNow, add equations (1) and (3) to eliminate x:\n\n(1) + (3): -2x - 4y + 2z + 2x + y - 3z = -10 - 4\n-3y - z = -14\n\nNow we have another new equation:\n\n(4) -3y - z = -14\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n(3) 7y - 5z = 8\n(4) -3y - z = -14\n\nLet's eliminate y from these two equations. To do this, we can multiply the third equation by 3 and the fourth equation by 7:\n\n(3) 3(7y - 5z) = 3(8)\n(4) 7(-3y - z) = 7(-14)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n(3) 21y - 15z = 24\n(4) -21y - 7z = -98\n\nNow, add equations (3) and (4) to eliminate y:\n\n(3) + (4): 21y - 15z - 21y - 7z = 24 - 98\n-22z = -74\n\nNow, divide both sides by -22:\n\nz = 74 / 22\nz = 37 / 11\n\nSince we got a value for z, it means there is a solution for this system of linear equations. Therefore, the given system of linear equations does not have no solutions."
