    "message_2": "To compute the second cohomology group $H^2$ of the algebraic variety given by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{C}^3$, we can use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for a smooth projective variety $X$ of dimension $n$ and a hyperplane section $Y \\subset X$, the restriction map $H^k(X) \\to H^k(Y)$ is an isomorphism for $k < n - 1$ and injective for $k = n - 1$.\n\nFirst, we projectivize the equation to obtain the projective variety in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ given by the homogeneous equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 = 0$. This is a smooth cubic surface in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, and its dimension is $n = 2$. \n\nNow, let $Y$ be a hyperplane section of this cubic surface. Since the cubic surface is smooth, $Y$ is a smooth curve. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem implies that the restriction map $H^k(X) \\to H^k(Y)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 2 - 1 = 1$ and injective for $k = 2 - 1 = 1$. \n\nIn particular, we have $H^2(X) \\cong H^2(Y)$, where $X$ is the cubic surface and $Y$ is the hyperplane section. Since $Y$ is a smooth curve, its second cohomology group is given by $H^2(Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, the second cohomology group of the algebraic variety given by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{C}^3$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, i.e., $H^2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
