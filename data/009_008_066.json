    "message_1": "A rod of length 10 cm is initially at rest at a temperature of 20 degree Celsius. The ends of the rod are suddenly subjected to temperatures of 30 degree Celsius and 10 degree Celsius respectively. Assume that heat flows in one direction only and that the thermal diffusivity of the rod is 0.5 cm²/s. Determine the temperature distribution in the rod at time t = 0.1 seconds using the wave equation.",
    "message_2": "The problem presented is a heat conduction problem, not a wave problem. The wave equation is not applicable in this case. Instead, we will use the heat equation to solve the problem.\n\nThe heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the position along the rod.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = α T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we get:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X) ∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side is only a function of time and the right side is only a function of position, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X) ∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n∂T(t)/∂t = -αλ²T(t)\n∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²X(x)\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A cos(λx) + B sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = 10:\n\nX(0) = A cos(0) + B sin(0) = A = 30 - 20 = 10\nX(10) = A cos(λ10) + B sin(λ10) = 20 - 10 = 10\n\nThe general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C exp(-αλ²t)\n\nThe temperature distribution in the rod is given by the product of X(x) and T(t):\n\nT(x, t) = X(x)T(t) = (10 cos(λx) + B sin(λx)) C exp(-αλ²t)\n\nTo find the coefficients B, λ, and C, we need to apply the boundary conditions and the initial condition:\n\nT(x, 0) = 10 cos(λx) + B sin(λx) = 20\n\nWe can use the Fourier series to represent the initial condition:\n\n20 = 10 + ∑[B_n sin(λ_n x)]\n\nwhere B_n and λ_n are the Fourier coefficients and eigenvalues.\n\nTo find B_n and λ_n, we can use the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\nB_n = (2/L) ∫[f(x) sin(λ_n x) dx] from 0 to L\n\nwhere L is the length of the rod (10 cm).\n\nIn this case, f(x) = 20, so the integral becomes:\n\nB_n = (2/10) ∫[20 sin(λ_n x) dx] from 0 to 10\n\nSolving the integral, we get:\n\nB_n = (20/λ_n)[1 - cos(λ_n 10)]\n\nNow we can write the temperature distribution as:\n\nT(x, t) = 10 + ∑[(20/λ_n)[1 - cos(λ_n 10)] sin(λ_n x) exp(-αλ_n²t)]\n\nTo find the temperature distribution at t = 0.1 seconds, we can plug in the values:\n\nT(x, 0.1) = 10 + ∑[(20/λ_n)[1 - cos(λ_n 10)] sin(λ_n x) exp(-0.5λ_n²(0.1))]\n\nThis is an infinite series, so we can approximate the temperature distribution by taking the first few terms of the series. The more terms we take, the more accurate the approximation will be."
