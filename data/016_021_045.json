    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal curve that can be generated using a recursive process. The fractal dimension (D) of a self-similar fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, each iteration creates 3 self-similar pieces (N = 3) and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 2 (s = 2). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.58\n\nTherefore, the fractal dimension of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is approximately 1.58, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
