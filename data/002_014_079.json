    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, width of 4 cm, and height of 5 cm. Find the surface area of the rectangular prism.",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to calculate the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area (SA) of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: length (l) = 6 cm, width (w) = 4 cm, and height (h) = 5 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSA = 2(6)(4) + 2(6)(5) + 2(4)(5)\nSA = 48 + 60 + 40\nSA = 148\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 148 square centimeters."
