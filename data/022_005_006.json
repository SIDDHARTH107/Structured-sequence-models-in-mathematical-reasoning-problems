    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of (z^2 + 1)/(z^3 - 1) around the unit circle |z| = 1 in the counterclockwise direction, we can use the residue theorem. The residue theorem states that for a function f(z) with isolated singularities inside a simple closed contour C,\n\n∮(f(z)dz) = 2πi * Σ(residues of f(z) at its singularities inside C)\n\nFirst, we need to find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 1)/(z^3 - 1). The singularities occur when the denominator is zero:\n\nz^3 - 1 = 0\nz^3 = 1\n\nThe solutions to this equation are the cube roots of unity:\n\nz = e^(2πik/3), k = 0, 1, 2\n\nThese are z = 1, z = e^(2πi/3), and z = e^(4πi/3).\n\nSince we are considering the unit circle |z| = 1, we can ignore the singularity at z = 1, as it lies on the contour and not inside it. Thus, we have two singularities inside the contour: z = e^(2πi/3) and z = e^(4πi/3).\n\nNow, we need to find the residues of f(z) at these singularities. To do this, we can use the formula for the residue of a simple pole:\n\nresidue = lim(z→a) [(z - a) * f(z)]\n\nFor z = e^(2πi/3):\n\nresidue = lim(z→e^(2πi/3)) [(z - e^(2πi/3)) * (z^2 + 1)/(z^3 - 1)]\n\nTo evaluate this limit, we can use L'Hopital's rule:\n\nresidue = lim(z→e^(2πi/3)) [(2z)/(3z^2)]\n\nresidue = (2e^(2πi/3))/(3(e^(4πi/3)))\n\nFor z = e^(4πi/3):\n\nresidue = lim(z→e^(4πi/3)) [(z - e^(4πi/3)) * (z^2 + 1)/(z^3 - 1)]\n\nAgain, using L'Hopital's rule:\n\nresidue = lim(z→e^(4πi/3)) [(2z)/(3z^2)]\n\nresidue = (2e^(4πi/3))/(3(e^(8πi/3)))\n\nNow, we can apply the residue theorem:\n\n∮(f(z)dz) = 2πi * [(2e^(2πi/3))/(3(e^(4πi/3))) + (2e^(4πi/3))/(3(e^(8πi/3)))]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n∮(f(z)dz) = 2πi * [(2e^(-2πi/3))/3 + (2e^(-4πi/3))/3]\n\n∮(f(z)dz) = (4πi/3) * [e^(-2πi/3) + e^(-4πi/3)]\n\nThis is the value of the integral of (z^2 + 1)/(z^3 - 1) around the unit circle |z| = 1 in the counterclockwise direction."
