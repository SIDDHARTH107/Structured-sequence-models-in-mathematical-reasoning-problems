    "message_1": "A certain system has 5 components, each with a 10% chance of failure. What is the probability that at least one component will fail?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one component will fail, it's easier to first find the probability that none of the components fail and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single component does not fail is 90% (100% - 10%). Since the components are independent, the probability that all 5 components do not fail is:\n\n0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.9^5 ≈ 0.59049\n\nNow, to find the probability that at least one component fails, we subtract the probability that none of them fail from 1:\n\n1 - 0.59049 ≈ 0.40951\n\nSo, the probability that at least one component will fail is approximately 40.95%."
