    "message_2": "To determine the magnitude and direction of the velocity vector of the plane, we need to break down the velocity into its components along the north and east directions.\n\nSince the plane is flying towards the north-east, it is flying at a 45-degree angle with respect to the north and east directions. We can use trigonometry to find the components of the velocity vector along the north and east directions.\n\nLet Vn be the component of the velocity along the north direction and Ve be the component of the velocity along the east direction.\n\nVn = 500 * cos(45°)\nVe = 500 * sin(45°)\n\nUsing the fact that cos(45°) = sin(45°) = √2/2:\n\nVn = 500 * (√2/2) = 250√2 km/h\nVe = 500 * (√2/2) = 250√2 km/h\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the velocity vector by using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nV = √(Vn² + Ve²)\nV = √((250√2)² + (250√2)²)\nV = √(2 * (250² * 2))\nV = √(2 * 125000)\nV = √250000\nV = 500 km/h\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity vector is 500 km/h, which is the same as the given speed of the plane.\n\nThe direction of the velocity vector can be found using the arctangent function:\n\nθ = arctan(Ve / Vn)\nθ = arctan(250√2 / 250√2)\nθ = arctan(1)\nθ = 45°\n\nThe direction of the velocity vector is 45°, which is the angle between the north and east directions. Therefore, the plane is flying towards the north-east.\n\nIn summary, the magnitude of the velocity vector is 500 km/h, and the direction is 45° towards the north-east."
