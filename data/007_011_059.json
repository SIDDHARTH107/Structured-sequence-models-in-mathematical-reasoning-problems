To find all the quadratic residues modulo 11, we need to find the squares of the integers from 0 to 10 (since 11 is a prime number) and then reduce them modulo 11.\n\n0² ≡ 0 (mod 11)\n1² ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n2² ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n3² ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n4² ≡ 16 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n5² ≡ 25 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n6² ≡ 36 ≡ 3 (mod 11)\n7² ≡ 49 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n8² ≡ 64 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n9² ≡ 81 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n10² ≡ 100 ≡ 1 (mod 11)\n\nNow, we can list the distinct quadratic residues modulo 11: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9}."
