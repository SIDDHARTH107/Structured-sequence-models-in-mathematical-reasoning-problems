    "message_2": "To find the edge connectivity of the given undirected graph, we need to determine the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. We can do this by finding the minimum cut of the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, we can see that the minimum cut is achieved by removing the following edges:\n- Edge connecting nodes A and B\n- Edge connecting nodes A and C\n- Edge connecting nodes A and D\n\nBy removing these 3 edges, the graph will be disconnected. Therefore, the edge connectivity of the given graph is 3."
