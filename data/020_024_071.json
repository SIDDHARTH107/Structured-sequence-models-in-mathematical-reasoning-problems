    "message_1": "A company has a fixed cost of $5000 to produce a product. The variable cost of each unit of the product is $10. The demand function for the product is estimated to be Q = 1000 - 10P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price. What price should the company charge for each unit to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to find the price (P) that maximizes the profit function. The profit function is given by:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue is given by the product of price (P) and quantity demanded (Q), i.e., R = PQ. We are given the demand function Q = 1000 - 10P. We can substitute this into the revenue function:\n\nR = P(1000 - 10P)\n\nNow, let's find the cost function. The cost function is given by the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost multiplied by the quantity produced (Q). In this case, the fixed cost is $5000, and the variable cost per unit is $10. So, the cost function is:\n\nCost = 5000 + 10Q\n\nSince Q = 1000 - 10P, we can substitute this into the cost function:\n\nCost = 5000 + 10(1000 - 10P)\n\nNow, we can find the profit function by subtracting the cost function from the revenue function:\n\nProfit = R - Cost\nProfit = P(1000 - 10P) - (5000 + 10(1000 - 10P))\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to P and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = 0\n\nLet's first expand the profit function:\n\nProfit = 1000P - 10P^2 - 5000 - 10000 + 100P\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nProfit = -10P^2 + 1100P - 15000\n\nNow, take the derivative with respect to P:\n\nd(Profit)/dP = -20P + 1100\n\nSet the derivative equal to 0 and solve for P:\n\n-20P + 1100 = 0\n20P = 1100\nP = 55\n\nSo, the company should charge $55 per unit to maximize its profit."
