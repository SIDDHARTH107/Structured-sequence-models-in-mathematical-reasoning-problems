Therefore, A ∩ B = {8, 16}.\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element in A. Since A ∩ B = {8, 16}, we can see that both 8 and 16 are elements of A. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\nNext, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element in B. Since A ∩ B = {8, 16}, we can see that both 8 and 16 are elements of B. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of B.\n\nIn conclusion, we have proven that A ∩ B is a subset of A and B respectively."
