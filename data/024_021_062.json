    "message_2": "A Killing vector field is a vector field that generates a one-parameter group of isometries of the metric. In other words, the Lie derivative of the metric tensor with respect to the Killing vector field must vanish. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X g_{ij} = 0$$\n\nwhere $X$ is the Killing vector field, $g_{ij}$ is the metric tensor, and $\\mathcal{L}_X$ is the Lie derivative with respect to $X$. In coordinates, the Lie derivative can be written as:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X g_{ij} = X^k \\partial_k g_{ij} + g_{kj} \\partial_i X^k + g_{ik} \\partial_j X^k$$\n\nFor the given metric on a sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$, the metric tensor components are:\n\n$$g_{\\theta\\theta} = 1, \\quad g_{\\phi\\phi} = \\sin^2\\theta, \\quad g_{\\theta\\phi} = g_{\\phi\\theta} = 0$$\n\nLet $X = X^\\theta(\\theta, \\phi) \\partial_\\theta + X^\\phi(\\theta, \\phi) \\partial_\\phi$. We need to find the components $X^\\theta(\\theta, \\phi)$ and $X^\\phi(\\theta, \\phi)$ such that the Lie derivative of the metric tensor components vanishes.\n\nFor $g_{\\theta\\theta}$, we have:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X g_{\\theta\\theta} = X^\\theta \\partial_\\theta g_{\\theta\\theta} + 2 g_{\\theta\\theta} \\partial_\\theta X^\\theta = 0$$\n\nSince $g_{\\theta\\theta} = 1$, this simplifies to:\n\n$$\\partial_\\theta X^\\theta = 0$$\n\nwhich implies that $X^\\theta$ is independent of $\\theta$:\n\n$$X^\\theta = X^\\theta(\\phi)$$\n\nFor $g_{\\phi\\phi}$, we have:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X g_{\\phi\\phi} = X^\\theta \\partial_\\theta g_{\\phi\\phi} + 2 g_{\\phi\\phi} \\partial_\\phi X^\\phi = 0$$\n\nSubstituting the metric components, we get:\n\n$$X^\\theta \\partial_\\theta (\\sin^2\\theta) + 2 \\sin^2\\theta \\, \\partial_\\phi X^\\phi = 0$$\n\nThis equation can be separated into two independent equations:\n\n1. $X^\\theta = 0$, which implies that $X^\\theta$ is a constant.\n2. $\\partial_\\phi X^\\phi = 0$, which implies that $X^\\phi$ is independent of $\\phi$:\n\n$$X^\\phi = X^\\phi(\\theta)$$\n\nNow, consider the off-diagonal components $g_{\\theta\\phi}$ and $g_{\\phi\\theta}$. Since they are both zero, we have:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X g_{\\theta\\phi} = X^\\theta \\partial_\\theta g_{\\theta\\phi} + g_{\\theta\\theta} \\partial_\\phi X^\\theta + g_{\\phi\\phi} \\partial_\\theta X^\\phi = 0$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\\partial_\\phi X^\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta \\, \\partial_\\theta X^\\phi = 0$$\n\nSince $X^\\theta$ is a constant, its derivative with respect to $\\phi$ is zero. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\\sin^2\\theta \\, \\partial_\\theta X^\\phi = 0$$\n\nThis implies that $X^\\phi$ is also a constant:\n\n$$X^\\phi = X^\\phi(\\phi)$$\n\nSo, the Killing vector fields are of the form:\n\n$$X = X^\\theta(\\phi) \\partial_\\theta + X^\\phi(\\theta) \\partial_\\phi$$\n\nwith $X^\\theta(\\phi)$ and $X^\\phi(\\theta)$ being constants. There are three linearly independent Killing vector fields on $\\mathbb{S}^2$:\n\n1. $X_1 = \\partial_\\theta$\n2. $X_2 = \\sin\\theta \\, \\partial_\\phi$\n3. $X_3 = \\cos\\theta \\, \\partial_\\phi$\n\nThese Killing vector fields correspond to rotations around the $z$-axis, rotations around the $x$-axis, and rotations around the $y$-axis, respectively."
