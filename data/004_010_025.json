    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2, we will apply the power rule for integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nSo, for f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2, we will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the first term, 3x^2:\nn = 2, so the antiderivative is (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3.\n\nFor the second term, -5x:\nn = 1, so the antiderivative is (-5x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (-5x^2)/2 = -5/2 * x^2.\n\nFor the third term, 2:\nn = 0, so the antiderivative is (2x^(0+1))/(0+1) = 2x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of each term and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 - (5/2)x^2 + 2x + C."
