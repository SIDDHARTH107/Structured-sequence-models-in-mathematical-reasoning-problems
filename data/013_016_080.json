    "message_1": "A company offers two compensation plans to its employees, Option A and Option B. Option A pays a fixed salary of $50,000 per year, while Option B pays a base salary of $40,000 per year plus an additional 10% commission on sales. Each employee can either work hard (with probability 0.6) or shirk (with probability 0.4). If an employee works hard, they generate $100,000 in sales; if they shirk, they generate only $70,000 in sales. Employees are risk averse and have a utility function of U(w) = √w. Assuming that employees shirk if their expected utility is higher by shirking than by working hard, which compensation plan will be chosen by risk-averse employees?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the expected utility for each option when employees work hard and when they shirk.\n\nOption A:\nSince the salary is fixed, the utility is the same for both working hard and shirking.\nU(50000) = √50000 ≈ 223.61\n\nOption B:\nWhen working hard, the employee generates $100,000 in sales, so their total income is $40,000 + 0.1 * $100,000 = $50,000.\nU(50000) = √50000 ≈ 223.61\n\nWhen shirking, the employee generates $70,000 in sales, so their total income is $40,000 + 0.1 * $70,000 = $47,000.\nU(47000) = √47000 ≈ 216.93\n\nNow let's calculate the expected utility for each option:\nOption A: The expected utility is the same for both working hard and shirking, so it's 223.61.\n\nOption B: The expected utility is the weighted average of the utilities when working hard and shirking.\nExpected Utility = 0.6 * U(50000) + 0.4 * U(47000) = 0.6 * 223.61 + 0.4 * 216.93 ≈ 221.17\n\nSince employees are risk-averse, they will choose the option with the higher expected utility. In this case, that is Option A with an expected utility of 223.61. Therefore, risk-averse employees will choose Option A."
