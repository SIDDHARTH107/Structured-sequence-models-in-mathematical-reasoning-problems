    "message_1": "Consider the (smooth) manifold $\\mathbb{S}^2$ representing the surface of a sphere of radius $r$. Suppose we want to compute its De Rham cohomology groups. \n\nWrite down the computation for the cohomology group $H^1(\\mathbb{S}^2)$, which represents the space of closed 1-forms modulo exact 1-forms on $\\mathbb{S}^2$. Specifically, find a basis for this cohomology group and compute its dimension.",
    "message_2": "To compute the De Rham cohomology group $H^1(\\mathbb{S}^2)$, we will use the fact that the De Rham cohomology groups of a smooth manifold are isomorphic to the singular cohomology groups with real coefficients. This is known as the De Rham theorem.\n\nFor the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$, we know its singular cohomology groups with real coefficients are given by:\n\n$H^0(\\mathbb{S}^2) = \\mathbb{R}$, $H^2(\\mathbb{S}^2) = \\mathbb{R}$, and $H^k(\\mathbb{S}^2) = 0$ for $k \\neq 0, 2$.\n\nTherefore, we have $H^1(\\mathbb{S}^2) = 0$. This means that there are no non-trivial closed 1-forms on $\\mathbb{S}^2$ that are not exact. In other words, every closed 1-form on $\\mathbb{S}^2$ is exact.\n\nThe dimension of this cohomology group is 0, and since it is trivial, there is no basis for it."
