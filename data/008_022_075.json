    "message_1": "Suppose we have the following system of linear equations:\n\n3x + 2y = 7\n\n4x + 3.9y = 9.4\n\nThis system can be represented in matrix form as AX = B, where A is the coefficient matrix, X is the solution matrix and B is the constant matrix.\n\nUsing Gaussian elimination solve the system of equations and find the values of x and y. Round the answers to the nearest hundredth if necessary.",
    "message_2": "First, let's represent the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\nA = | 3  2  |\n    | 4  3.9|\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 7   |\n    | 9.4 |\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to solve the system of equations.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the x term in the second equation.\n\nTo do this, we'll multiply the first equation by -4/3 and add it to the second equation.\n\n-4/3 * (3x + 2y) = -4/3 * 7\n-4x - 8/3y = -28/3\n\nNow, add the first equation multiplied by -4/3 to the second equation:\n\n(-4x - 8/3y) + (4x + 3.9y) = -28/3 + 9.4\n\n0x + 1.7y = 0.6\n\nStep 2: Solve for y.\n\n1.7y = 0.6\ny = 0.6 / 1.7\ny ≈ 0.35\n\nStep 3: Substitute the value of y back into the first equation to solve for x.\n\n3x + 2(0.35) = 7\n3x + 0.7 = 7\n3x = 6.3\nx = 6.3 / 3\nx = 2.1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x ≈ 2.1 and y ≈ 0.35."
