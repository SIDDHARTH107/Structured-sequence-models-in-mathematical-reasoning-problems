    "message_2": "To find the factors of the polynomial 6x^2 + 11x - 10, we can use the factoring by grouping method.\n\nFirst, we look for two numbers whose product is equal to the product of the leading coefficient (6) and the constant term (-10), and whose sum is equal to the middle coefficient (11).\n\nThe product of the leading coefficient and the constant term is (6)(-10) = -60.\n\nWe are looking for two numbers whose product is -60 and whose sum is 11. These two numbers are 15 and -4, since (15)(-4) = -60 and 15 + (-4) = 11.\n\nNow, we rewrite the middle term (11x) as the sum of the two numbers we found, multiplied by x:\n\n6x^2 + 11x - 10 = 6x^2 + 15x - 4x - 10\n\nNext, we group the terms in pairs and factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each pair:\n\n6x^2 + 15x - 4x - 10 = 3x(2x + 5) - 2(2x + 5)\n\nNow, we can see that both terms have a common factor of (2x + 5). We can factor this out:\n\n3x(2x + 5) - 2(2x + 5) = (3x - 2)(2x + 5)\n\nSo, the factors of the polynomial 6x^2 + 11x - 10 are (3x - 2) and (2x + 5)."
