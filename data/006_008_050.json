The class has 30 students going on the trip. What is the probability that at least 7 students get rained on during the weekend?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 7 students get rained on during the weekend, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (students getting rained on) in n trials (number of students)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of a single success (rain during the weekend)\n- n is the number of trials (students)\n- k is the number of successes (students getting rained on)\n\nIn this case, n = 30, p = 0.25, and we want to find the probability that at least 7 students get rained on (k ≥ 7). To find this probability, we can sum the probabilities of k = 7 to k = 30:\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = 1 - P(X < 7) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 6))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each k from 0 to 6 and sum them up:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(30, 0) * 0.25^0 * 0.75^30\nP(X = 1) = C(30, 1) * 0.25^1 * 0.75^29\n...\nP(X = 6) = C(30, 6) * 0.25^6 * 0.75^24\n\nSumming up these probabilities:\n\nP(X < 7) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 6)\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least 7 students getting rained on:\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = 1 - P(X < 7)\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities and summing them up, we get:\n\nP(X ≥ 7) ≈ 0.9844\n\nSo, the probability that at least 7 students get rained on during the weekend is approximately 98.44%."
