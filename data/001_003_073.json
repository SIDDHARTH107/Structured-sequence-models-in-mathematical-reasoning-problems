    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the elimination method, we need to eliminate one of the variables by adding or subtracting the equations. In this case, we can eliminate the x variable by multiplying the first equation by -2 and then adding the two equations.\n\nFirst, multiply the first equation by -2:\n-2(2x + 3y) = -2(11)\n-4x - 6y = -22\n\nNow we have the two equations:\n-4x - 6y = -22\n4x + 7y = 23\n\nAdd the two equations to eliminate the x variable:\n(-4x - 6y) + (4x + 7y) = -22 + 23\n-6y + 7y = 1\ny = 1\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for x. We'll use the first equation:\n2x + 3y = 11\n2x + 3(1) = 11\n2x + 3 = 11\n2x = 8\nx = 4\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 4 and y = 1."
