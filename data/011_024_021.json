The demand for water in town A, B, and C is 900, 1200, and 800 units respectively. Find the maximum flow of water from the supply source to the towns, such that each town receives its demand while water supply does not exceed the capacity.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the flow of water to town A, B, and C as x, y, and z units respectively. We are given the following constraints:\n\n1. The total flow of water should not exceed the maximum capacity of the water supply: x + y + z â‰¤ 2000 units.\n2. The flow of water to town A should meet its demand: x = 900 units.\n3. The flow of water to town B should meet its demand: y = 1200 units.\n4. The flow of water to town C should meet its demand: z = 800 units.\n\nNow, let's check if the sum of the demands of the three towns is within the maximum capacity of the water supply:\n\n900 + 1200 + 800 = 2900 units.\n\nSince 2900 units are greater than the maximum capacity of 2000 units, it is not possible to meet the demands of all three towns simultaneously.\n\nTo find the maximum flow of water from the supply source to the towns, we need to determine how much water can be supplied to each town while still meeting the constraint that the total flow of water should not exceed 2000 units.\n\nWe can start by supplying the full demand to town A and town B:\n\nx = 900 units\ny = 1200 units\n\nNow, we have 2000 - (900 + 1200) = 2000 - 2100 = -100 units left for town C. Since we cannot have a negative flow of water, we need to adjust the flow of water to town B.\n\nLet's reduce the flow of water to town B by 100 units:\n\ny = 1200 - 100 = 1100 units\n\nNow, we have 2000 - (900 + 1100) = 2000 - 2000 = 0 units left for town C. This means that we can supply the full demand to town A and town C, and 1100 units to town B.\n\nSo, the maximum flow of water from the supply source to the towns is:\n\nTown A: 900 units\nTown B: 1100 units\nTown C: 800 units\n\nTotal flow: 900 + 1100 + 800 = 2800 units."
