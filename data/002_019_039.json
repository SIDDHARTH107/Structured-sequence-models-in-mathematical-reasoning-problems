    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a right circular cone, we need to find the area of the base and the lateral surface area, then add them together.\n\nThe base is a circle with a radius of 5 cm. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nA_base = π(5 cm)^2\nA_base ≈ 3.14 * 25 cm^2\nA_base ≈ 78.5 cm^2\n\nThe lateral surface area of a cone is given by the formula A_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius, and s is the slant height.\n\nA_lateral = π(5 cm)(12 cm)\nA_lateral ≈ 3.14 * 60 cm^2\nA_lateral ≈ 188.4 cm^2\n\nNow, we add the base area and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area.\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 78.5 cm^2 + 188.4 cm^2\nA_total ≈ 266.9 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cone, rounded to the nearest hundredth, is approximately 266.9 cm^2."
