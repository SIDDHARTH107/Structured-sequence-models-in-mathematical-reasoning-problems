    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 8 cm and a height of 5 cm. What is its area?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 5 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 * 5) / 2\nArea = 40 / 2\nArea = 20 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 20 square centimeters."
