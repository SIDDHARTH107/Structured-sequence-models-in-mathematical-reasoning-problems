    "message_2": "First, we need to express the given linear programming problem in standard form. To do this, we introduce slack variables s1 and s2 to convert the inequalities into equalities:\n\n2x + y + s1 = 10\nx + 3y + s2 = 15\nx, y, s1, s2 ≥ 0\n\nNow, the problem can be written as:\n\nMaximize: Z = 4x + 3y\n\nSubject to:\n\n2x + y + s1 = 10\nx + 3y + s2 = 15\nx, y, s1, s2 ≥ 0\n\nNext, we will set up the initial simplex tableau:\n\n|  2  1  1  0  0  10 |\n|  1  3  0  1  0  15 |\n| -4 -3  0  0  1   0 |\n\nNow, we will perform the Simplex Method:\n\n1. Identify the pivot column: The most negative entry in the bottom row is -4, so the pivot column is the first column.\n\n2. Identify the pivot row: Divide the right-hand side by the corresponding entry in the pivot column (ignoring negative or zero values) and choose the smallest result. In this case, 10/2 = 5 and 15/1 = 15. The smallest result is 5, so the pivot row is the first row.\n\n3. Make the pivot element 1: The pivot element is already 1 (the intersection of the pivot column and pivot row).\n\n4. Make the other elements in the pivot column 0: Add 2 times the first row to the second row and 4 times the first row to the bottom row.\n\nNew tableau:\n\n|  2  1  1  0  0  10 |\n|  0  5  -1  1  0  5  |\n|  0  1  4  0  1  40 |\n\n5. Identify the pivot column: There are no more negative entries in the bottom row, so the Simplex Method is complete.\n\nNow, we can read the solution from the final tableau:\n\nx = 0\ny = 40/1 = 40\ns1 = 10 - 2x - y = 10 - 2(0) - 40 = -30 (slack variable, ignore)\ns2 = 5 - 5y = 5 - 5(40) = -195 (slack variable, ignore)\n\nThe optimal solution is x = 0 and y = 40, with a maximum value of Z = 4x + 3y = 4(0) + 3(40) = 120."
