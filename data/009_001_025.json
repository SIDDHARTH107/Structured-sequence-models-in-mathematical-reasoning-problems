    "message_2": "The logistic growth model is given by the formula:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate parameter, and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nIn this case, K = 1000 rabbits, P0 = 100 rabbits, r = 0.05 per year, and we want to find the population after 10 years, so t = 10.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(10) = 1000 / (1 + (1000 - 100) / 100 * e^(-0.05*10))\n\nP(10) = 1000 / (1 + 900 / 100 * e^(-0.5))\n\nP(10) = 1000 / (1 + 9 * e^(-0.5))\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of e^(-0.5) and then the entire expression:\n\ne^(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653\n\nP(10) = 1000 / (1 + 9 * 0.60653)\n\nP(10) = 1000 / (1 + 5.45877)\n\nP(10) = 1000 / 6.45877\n\nP(10) ≈ 154.79\n\nSo, after 10 years, the population of rabbits on the island will be approximately 155 rabbits."
