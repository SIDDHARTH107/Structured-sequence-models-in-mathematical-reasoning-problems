    "message_2": "To find the number of ordered pairs in A × B, we need to find all possible combinations of elements from set A and set B. Since set A has 3 elements and set B has 4 elements, there are 3 * 4 = 12 possible ordered pairs in A × B.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ordered pairs in B × A. Since set B has 4 elements and set A has 3 elements, there are 4 * 3 = 12 possible ordered pairs in B × A.\n\nHowever, even though the cardinalities of A × B and B × A are equal (both have 12 ordered pairs), this does not mean that the Cartesian product is commutative. The elements of the ordered pairs in A × B and B × A are different.\n\nFor example, let A = {a, b, c} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4}. In A × B, we have ordered pairs like (a, 1), (a, 2), (b, 1), etc. In B × A, we have ordered pairs like (1, a), (1, b), (2, a), etc.\n\nNotice that the ordered pairs in A × B and B × A are not the same. For example, (a, 1) is in A × B but not in B × A, and (1, a) is in B × A but not in A × B. Therefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
