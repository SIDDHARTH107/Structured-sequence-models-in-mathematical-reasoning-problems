    "message_2": "The logistic equation is given by:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) * e^(-r*t) / P0)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, P0 is the initial population, r is the rate parameter, and t is the time.\n\nIn this case, K = 5000, P0 = 100, r = 0.7, and t = 10.\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + (5000 - 100) * e^(-0.7*10) / 100)\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + 4900 * e^(-7) / 100)\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + 49 * e^(-7))\n\nNow, we calculate the value of e^(-7):\n\ne^(-7) ≈ 0.00091188\n\nNow, we plug this value back into the equation:\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + 49 * 0.00091188)\n\nP(10) = 5000 / (1 + 0.04468232)\n\nP(10) = 5000 / 1.04468232\n\nP(10) ≈ 4788.24\n\nAfter 10 time units, the population will be approximately 4788.24 bacteria."
