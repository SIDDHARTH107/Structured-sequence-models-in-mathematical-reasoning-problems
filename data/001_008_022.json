    "message_2": "To find the solutions of the inequality 2x + 3y ≤ 12, we first need to find the boundary line, which is given by the equation 2x + 3y = 12. We can rewrite this equation as y = (12 - 2x)/3.\n\nNow, we need to find the integer values of x and y that satisfy the inequality. Since x is a non-negative integer and y is a positive integer, we can start by testing values of x from 0 onwards.\n\n1. If x = 0, y = (12 - 2*0)/3 = 4. This satisfies the inequality, so (0, 4) is a solution.\n2. If x = 1, y = (12 - 2*1)/3 = 10/3 ≈ 3.33. The closest positive integer value of y is 3, which satisfies the inequality, so (1, 3) is a solution.\n3. If x = 2, y = (12 - 2*2)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.67. The closest positive integer value of y is 2, which satisfies the inequality, so (2, 2) is a solution.\n4. If x = 3, y = (12 - 2*3)/3 = 6/3 = 2. This satisfies the inequality, so (3, 2) is a solution.\n5. If x = 4, y = (12 - 2*4)/3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.33. The closest positive integer value of y is 1, which satisfies the inequality, so (4, 1) is a solution.\n6. If x = 5, y = (12 - 2*5)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.67. There is no positive integer value of y that satisfies the inequality for x = 5.\n7. If x = 6 or greater, the value of y will be negative or zero, which does not satisfy the conditions.\n\nSo, the solutions of the inequality are (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 1).\n\nTo graph these solutions on the coordinate plane, plot the points (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 1). The region containing these points and below the line 2x + 3y = 12 represents the solutions to the inequality 2x + 3y ≤ 12."
