    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the given partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T'(t) = DT''(t)X(x) + rX(x)T(t) - aX^2(x)T^2(t)$.\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = D\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} + r - a\\frac{X(x)}{T(t)}$.\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-\\lambda$:\n\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = -\\lambda$.\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $T(t)$. Integrating, we get:\n\n$T'(t) + \\lambda T(t) = 0$.\n\nNow, we can find the equation for $X(x)$ by substituting the constant $-\\lambda$ back into the equation for the right-hand side:\n\n$D\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} + r - a\\frac{X(x)}{T(t)} = -\\lambda$.\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n$D\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda + r - a\\frac{X(x)}{T(t)}$.\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $x$, we can equate it to the constant $-\\lambda$:\n\n$D\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$.\n\nThis is a second-order ODE for $X(x)$:\n\n$X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda}{D}X(x) = 0$.\n\nNow, we have two ODEs:\n\n1. $T'(t) + \\lambda T(t) = 0$.\n2. $X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda}{D}X(x) = 0$.\n\nWe will solve the second ODE first. Since the initial condition is given by $u(x,0)=\\sin(\\pi x)$, we can guess that the solution for $X(x)$ is of the form $X(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)$, where $n$ is an integer. Taking the second derivative, we get:\n\n$X''(x) = -(n\\pi)^2\\sin(n\\pi x)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the second ODE, we get:\n\n$-(n\\pi)^2\\sin(n\\pi x) + \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\\sin(n\\pi x) = 0$.\n\nDividing by $\\sin(n\\pi x)$, we get:\n\n$-(n\\pi)^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{D} = 0$.\n\nSolving for $\\lambda$, we get:\n\n$\\lambda = D(n\\pi)^2$.\n\nNow, we can solve the first ODE. Substituting the value of $\\lambda$ into the first ODE, we get:\n\n$T'(t) + D(n\\pi)^2 T(t) = 0$.\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is given by:\n\n$T(t) = Ce^{-D(n\\pi)^2t}$,\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant.\n\nNow, we have the solutions for $X(x)$ and $T(t)$:\n\n$X(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)$,\n$T(t) = Ce^{-D(n\\pi)^2t}$.\n\nThe general solution for the reaction-diffusion equation is given by the product of $X(x)$ and $T(t)$:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin(n\\pi x)Ce^{-D(n\\pi)^2t}$.\n\nTo find the concentration of the substance at $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $t=2$, we need to determine the values of $n$ and $C$. Since the initial condition is given by $u(x,0)=\\sin(\\pi x)$, we can see that $n=1$ and $C=1$. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin(\\pi x)e^{-(\\pi)^2t}$.\n\nNow, we can find the concentration at $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $t=2$:\n\n$u\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 2\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\right)e^{-(\\pi)^2 \\cdot 2}$.\n\nCalculating the values, we get:\n\n$u\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 2\\right) = 1 \\cdot e^{-2\\pi^2} \\approx 0.001867$.\n\nSo, the concentration of the substance at $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $t=2$ is approximately $0.001867$."
