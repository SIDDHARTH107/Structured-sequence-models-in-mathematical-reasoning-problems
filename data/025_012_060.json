    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through points P(-2, 3) and Q(1, -1), we can use the slope-point form of a linear equation: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.\n\nFirst, we need to find the slope (m) of the line passing through P and Q. The slope can be found using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nUsing the coordinates of points P(-2, 3) and Q(1, -1), we have:\n\nm = (-1 - 3) / (1 - (-2)) = (-4) / (3) = -4/3\n\nNow, we can use the slope-point form with point P(-2, 3) and the slope m = -4/3:\n\ny - 3 = -4/3 (x - (-2))\n\ny - 3 = -4/3 (x + 2)\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3:\n\n3(y - 3) = -4(x + 2)\n\n3y - 9 = -4x - 8\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to the standard form:\n\n4x + 3y - 1 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the line that passes through points P(-2, 3) and Q(1, -1) is:\n\n4x + 3y - 1 = 0"
