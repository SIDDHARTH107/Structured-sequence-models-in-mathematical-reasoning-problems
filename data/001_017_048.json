    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation log2(x+7) - log2(3x-1) = 2, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can use the quotient rule, which states that logb(A) - logb(B) = logb(A/B). Applying this rule, we get:\n\nlog2((x+7)/(3x-1)) = 2\n\nNow, we can use the property that logb(A) = C is equivalent to A = b^C. In this case, we have:\n\n(x+7)/(3x-1) = 2^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(x+7)/(3x-1) = 4\n\nNow, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying:\n\n4(3x-1) = x+7\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n12x - 4 = x + 7\n\nSubtracting x from both sides, we have:\n\n11x - 4 = 7\n\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get:\n\n11x = 11\n\nFinally, dividing by 11, we find:\n\nx = 1\n\nSo the solution to the logarithmic equation is x = 1."
