    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = 2te^(-2t) for t ≥ 0. The Fourier transform is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit. In our case, f(t) = 2te^(-2t) for t ≥ 0. So, we have:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[2te^(-2t) * e^(-jωt)] dt from 0 to ∞\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = 2t and dv = e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt) dt. Then, du = 2 dt and v = ∫[e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt)] dt = -1/(2+jω) * e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt).\n\nNow, we can apply integration by parts:\n\nF(ω) = uv | from 0 to ∞ - ∫[v du] from 0 to ∞\n\nF(ω) = [(-2t/(2+jω)) * e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt)] | from 0 to ∞ - ∫[(-2/(2+jω)) * e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt) dt] from 0 to ∞\n\nThe first term goes to 0 as t goes to infinity. So, we are left with:\n\nF(ω) = 0 - (-2/(2+jω)) * ∫[e^(-2t) * e^(-jωt) dt] from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can combine the exponentials and integrate:\n\nF(ω) = (2/(2+jω)) * ∫[e^(-2t(1+jω/2))] dt from 0 to ∞\n\nF(ω) = (2/(2+jω)) * [-1/(2(1+jω/2)) * e^(-2t(1+jω/2))] | from 0 to ∞\n\nAs t goes to infinity, the exponential term goes to 0. So, we have:\n\nF(ω) = (2/(2+jω)) * [-1/(2(1+jω/2)) * (0 - 1)]\n\nF(ω) = (2/(2+jω)) * (1/(2(1+jω/2)))\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier transform to determine the velocity U(k) of the fluid in the pipe. The pressure difference P(x) is given by P(x) = 10cos(2πx/L) Pa, where L = 1 m and x is the distance along the pipe in meters. The Fourier series representation of P(x) is:\n\nP(x) = Σ[C_n * e^(jn(2πx/L))]\n\nwhere C_n are the Fourier coefficients. Since P(x) is a cosine function, we only need to consider the n = ±1 terms:\n\nP(x) = C_1 * e^(j(2πx/L)) + C_{-1} * e^(-j(2πx/L))\n\nComparing this to the given P(x), we have:\n\nC_1 = C_{-1} = 5\n\nNow, we can find the velocity U(k) using the Fourier transform of f(t) and the Fourier coefficients C_n:\n\nU(k) = (1/ρ) * Σ[C_n * F(ω_n)]\n\nwhere ρ is the fluid density, ω_n = n(2π/L), and k is the wavenumber. Since we only have the n = ±1 terms, we have:\n\nU(k) = (1/ρ) * [5 * F(2π/L) + 5 * F(-2π/L)]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for R, L, and F(ω):\n\nR = 0.1 m\nL = 1 m\nF(ω) = (2/(2+jω)) * (1/(2(1+jω/2)))\n\nU(k) = (1/ρ) * [5 * (2/(2+j(2π))) * (1/(2(1+j(π))) + 5 * (2/(2-j(2π))) * (1/(2(1-j(π))))\n\nThis expression gives the velocity U(k) of the fluid in the pipe as a function of the wavenumber k. To find the actual velocity at a specific point in the pipe, we would need to know the fluid density ρ and evaluate the expression for the given wavenumber k."
