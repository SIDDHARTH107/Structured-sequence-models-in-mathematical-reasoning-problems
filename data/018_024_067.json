    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the symmetric difference A △ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow let's find A'. Since A' is the complement of A, it contains all elements that are not in A. We don't have a universal set defined, so let's assume the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nThen, A' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1, 2, 3} = {4}\n\nNow we can calculate (A △ B) ∩ A':\n\n(A △ B) ∩ A' = {1, 4} ∩ {4} = {4}\n\nNow let's check if the symmetric difference is distributive over complement. The distributive property states that:\n\nA △ (B ∩ C) = (A △ B) ∩ (A △ C)\n\nIn our case, we want to check if:\n\nA △ (B ∩ A') = (A △ B) ∩ (A △ A')\n\nFirst, let's find B ∩ A':\n\nB ∩ A' = {2, 3, 4} ∩ {4} = {4}\n\nNow, let's find A △ (B ∩ A'):\n\nA △ (B ∩ A') = A △ {4} = {1, 2, 3} △ {4} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNext, let's find A △ A':\n\nA △ A' = {1, 2, 3} △ {4} = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\nNow we can check if the distributive property holds:\n\n(A △ B) ∩ (A △ A') = {1, 4} ∩ {1, 2, 3, 4} = {1, 4}\n\nSince A △ (B ∩ A') = {1, 2, 3, 4} and (A △ B) ∩ (A △ A') = {1, 4}, the distributive property does not hold in this case. The symmetric difference is not distributive over complement."
