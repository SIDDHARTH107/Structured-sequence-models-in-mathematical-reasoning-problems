    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve related to Principal-Agent problem in Game Theory:\n\nSuppose there is a principal who wants an agent to produce a certain output. The agent's effort level affects the output as follows: if the agent exerts low effort, the output is 10; if the agent exerts high effort, the output is 20. The principal offers a payment scheme to the agent: if the output is 20, the agent receives a bonus of 50, otherwise the agent receives a base payment of 20. The agent's cost of exerting high effort is 15 and the cost of exerting low effort is 5. What incentive does the agent have to exert high effort and what incentive does the principal have to offer the payment scheme?",
    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the agent's incentives under the given payment scheme. We will calculate the agent's net payoff for both low effort and high effort.\n\n1. Low effort:\nOutput = 10\nPayment = 20 (base payment)\nCost = 5\nNet payoff = Payment - Cost = 20 - 5 = 15\n\n2. High effort:\nOutput = 20\nPayment = 50 (bonus)\nCost = 15\nNet payoff = Payment - Cost = 50 - 15 = 35\n\nThe agent has an incentive to exert high effort because the net payoff for high effort (35) is greater than the net payoff for low effort (15).\n\nNow, let's analyze the principal's incentives to offer the payment scheme. We will calculate the principal's net benefit for both low effort and high effort.\n\n1. Low effort:\nOutput = 10\nPayment = 20 (base payment)\nNet benefit = Output - Payment = 10 - 20 = -10\n\n2. High effort:\nOutput = 20\nPayment = 50 (bonus)\nNet benefit = Output - Payment = 20 - 50 = -30\n\nThe principal has an incentive to offer the payment scheme because the net benefit for high effort (-30) is greater than the net benefit for low effort (-10) when considering the principal's goal of achieving a higher output. Although the principal incurs a higher cost with the high effort payment scheme, the principal values the higher output (20) more than the cost difference between the two payment schemes."
