    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The profit for each product is $5 and $8, respectively. The factory has limited resources and can produce up to 200 units per day. Product A takes 2 hours to produce and a maximum of 8 hours is available per day. Product B takes 3 hours to produce and a maximum of 12 hours is available per day. The factory must produce at least 20 units of product A and 10 units of product B per day. What is the optimal number of units of product A and product B that the factory should produce per day to maximize profit while respecting the given constraints using the Bat algorithm?",
    "message_2": "The Bat algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the echolocation behavior of microbats. However, the problem presented can be solved using linear programming, which is a more suitable method for this type of problem.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (maximize profit): P = 5x + 8y\n\nConstraints:\n1. x + y ≤ 200 (total units per day)\n2. 2x ≤ 8 (hours for product A)\n3. 3y ≤ 12 (hours for product B)\n4. x ≥ 20 (minimum units of product A)\n5. y ≥ 10 (minimum units of product B)\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints. Then, we will find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\n1. 2x ≤ 8 => x ≤ 4\n2. 3y ≤ 12 => y ≤ 4\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices (20, 10), (20, 4), (4, 10), and (4, 4).\n\nNow, we evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\nP(20, 10) = 5(20) + 8(10) = 100 + 80 = 180\nP(20, 4) = 5(20) + 8(4) = 100 + 32 = 132\nP(4, 10) = 5(4) + 8(10) = 20 + 80 = 100\nP(4, 4) = 5(4) + 8(4) = 20 + 32 = 52\n\nThe maximum profit is $180 per day when producing 20 units of product A and 10 units of product B."
