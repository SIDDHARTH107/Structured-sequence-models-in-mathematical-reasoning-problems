    "message_2": "The cardinality of the set of first-order formulas with one free variable over an infinite domain is uncountably infinite.\n\nTo see why, consider the set of all first-order formulas with one free variable x over an infinite domain D. Each formula can be thought of as a string of symbols from a finite alphabet (e.g., logical connectives, quantifiers, variables, constants, and predicate symbols). Since there are countably many finite strings of symbols, there are countably many possible formulas.\n\nHowever, for each element d in the infinite domain D, we can create a distinct formula that asserts that x is equal to d (e.g., x = d). Since D is infinite, there are infinitely many such formulas. Moreover, since each of these formulas is true for a different element of D, they are not logically equivalent and thus represent distinct elements of the set of first-order formulas with one free variable.\n\nSince there are uncountably many elements in D, there must be uncountably many distinct first-order formulas with one free variable. Therefore, the cardinality of the set of first-order formulas with one free variable over an infinite domain is uncountably infinite."
