    "message_1": "Suppose a grocery store sells apples, bananas and oranges. On a particular day, the store sold a total of 110 fruits, for a total sales revenue of $162.50. If the store each banana costs twice as much as each apple and each orange costs three times as much as each apple, find the cost of each fruit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of apples sold, y be the number of bananas sold, and z be the number of oranges sold. Let a be the cost of an apple, b be the cost of a banana, and c be the cost of an orange.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n1. x + y + z = 110 (total number of fruits sold)\n2. a * x + b * y + c * z = 162.50 (total sales revenue)\n3. b = 2a (each banana costs twice as much as each apple)\n4. c = 3a (each orange costs three times as much as each apple)\n\nWe can use the given information to set up a system of equations and solve for the cost of each fruit.\n\nFirst, we can substitute the expressions for b and c from equations 3 and 4 into equation 2:\n\na * x + (2a) * y + (3a) * z = 162.50\n\nNow we can factor out a from the left side of the equation:\n\na(x + 2y + 3z) = 162.50\n\nNext, we need to find expressions for x + 2y + 3z in terms of the total number of fruits sold (110). We can do this by multiplying equation 1 by 2 and subtracting it from the equation for x + 2y + 3z:\n\nx + 2y + 3z - 2(x + y + z) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx + 2y + 3z - 2x - 2y - 2z = 0\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nz = 110\n\nNow we can substitute this value back into the equation for a(x + 2y + 3z):\n\na(110) = 162.50\n\nDivide both sides by 110 to find the cost of an apple:\n\na = 162.50 / 110\na = 1.4773 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nNow we can find the cost of a banana and an orange using equations 3 and 4:\n\nb = 2a = 2 * 1.4773 = 2.9545 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\nc = 3a = 3 * 1.4773 = 4.4318 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n\nSo, the cost of each fruit is approximately $1.4773 for an apple, $2.9545 for a banana, and $4.4318 for an orange."
