    "message_1": "Assuming there are 10 farmers sharing a common grazing land with a carrying capacity of 100 cows. Each farmer has 10 cows. If the farmers do not cooperate and continue to add cows to the land, what will be the total number of cows on the land if each farmer decides to keep 2 extra cows?",
    "message_2": "If each of the 10 farmers has 10 cows initially, there are a total of 10 * 10 = 100 cows on the land. If each farmer decides to keep 2 extra cows, there would be an additional 10 * 2 = 20 cows added to the land. Therefore, the total number of cows on the land would be 100 + 20 = 120 cows."
