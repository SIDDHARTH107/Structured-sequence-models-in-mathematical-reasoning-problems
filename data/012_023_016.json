    "message_2": "The maximum number of people in a party such that each person knows all the others in the party can be any positive integer. In graph theory, this is represented by a complete graph, where each vertex (person) is connected to every other vertex (person) by an edge (knowing each other). The clique number of a complete graph is equal to the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nFor example, if there are 5 people in the party and each person knows all the others, the corresponding graph is a complete graph with 5 vertices, and the clique number is 5. Similarly, if there are 10 people in the party and each person knows all the others, the corresponding graph is a complete graph with 10 vertices, and the clique number is 10.\n\nSo, there is no specific maximum number of people in a party such that each person knows all the others, as it can be any positive integer. The clique number of the corresponding graph will always be equal to the number of people in the party."
