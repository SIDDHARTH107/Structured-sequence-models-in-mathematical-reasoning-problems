    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the quadratic equation y = -3x² + 6x - 9, we can use the vertex formula:\n\nx = -b / 2a\n\nwhere a = -3 and b = 6.\n\nx = -6 / (2 * -3)\nx = -6 / -6\nx = 1\n\nNow we can find the y-coordinate of the vertex by plugging the x-coordinate back into the equation:\n\ny = -3(1)² + 6(1) - 9\ny = -3 + 6 - 9\ny = -6\n\nSo, the vertex of the quadratic equation is (1, -6).\n\nThe axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is:\n\nx = 1\n\nTo find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = -3x² + 6x - 9\n\nWe can try to factor the equation or use the quadratic formula. In this case, let's use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = -3, b = 6, and c = -9.\n\nx = (-6 ± √(6² - 4(-3)(-9))) / 2(-3)\nx = (-6 ± √(36 - 108)) / -6\nx = (-6 ± √(-72)) / -6\n\nSince the discriminant (b² - 4ac) is negative, there are no real x-intercepts.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = -3(0)² + 6(0) - 9\ny = -9\n\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, -9).\n\nIn summary:\n- Vertex: (1, -6)\n- Axis of symmetry: x = 1\n- X-intercepts: None (no real solutions)\n- Y-intercept: (0, -9)"
