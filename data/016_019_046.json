    "message_2": "A Koch snowflake is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively replacing each line segment with a Koch curve. The Koch curve is formed by dividing the line segment into three equal parts and replacing the middle part with two sides of an equilateral triangle of the same length as the removed part.\n\nAfter each iteration, the number of segments in the Koch snowflake increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nLet's calculate the total length of the boundary of the Koch snowflake after 4 iterations:\n\n1. Original equilateral triangle: 3 sides, each with a length of 5 cm.\n2. First iteration: 3 * 4 = 12 segments, each with a length of 5/3 cm.\n3. Second iteration: 12 * 4 = 48 segments, each with a length of (5/3) * (1/3) cm.\n4. Third iteration: 48 * 4 = 192 segments, each with a length of (5/3) * (1/3)^2 cm.\n5. Fourth iteration: 192 * 4 = 768 segments, each with a length of (5/3) * (1/3)^3 cm.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total length of the boundary after 4 iterations:\n\nTotal length = 768 segments * (5/3) * (1/3)^3 cm\nTotal length = 768 * (5/81) cm\nTotal length = 3840/81 cm â‰ˆ 47.41 cm\n\nSo, the total length of the boundary of the Koch snowflake after 4 iterations is approximately 47.41 cm."
