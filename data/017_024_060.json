    "message_2": "To find the non-abelian groups of order 96, we first analyze the prime factorization of 96. We have 96 = 2^5 * 3^1. Now, we will use the Sylow theorems to find the possible Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, by Sylow's third theorem, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup, which is normal. If n_2 = 3, then the 2-Sylow subgroups are not normal.\n\nFor the 3-Sylow subgroups, by Sylow's third theorem, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 32 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup, which is normal. If n_3 = 4, then the 3-Sylow subgroups are not normal.\n\nNow, we consider the following cases:\n\n1. Both 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups are normal: In this case, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are C32 and C3. The direct product C32 × C3 is abelian, so it is not a non-abelian group of order 96.\n\n2. 2-Sylow subgroups are normal, but 3-Sylow subgroups are not: In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are C32 and C3. There are two non-abelian semi-direct products in this case: C32 ⋊ C3 and (C16 × C2) ⋊ C3. \n\n3. 3-Sylow subgroups are normal, but 2-Sylow subgroups are not: In this case, the group is a semi-direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are C2^5 and C3. There are four non-abelian semi-direct products in this case: C2^5 ⋊ C3, (C2^4 × C2) ⋊ C3, (C2^3 × C2^2) ⋊ C3, and (C2^2 × C2^2 × C2) ⋊ C3.\n\n4. Both 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups are not normal: In this case, there is no non-abelian group of order 96.\n\nThus, there are a total of 2 + 4 = 6 non-abelian groups of order 96. They are:\n\n1. C32 ⋊ C3\n2. (C16 × C2) ⋊ C3\n3. C2^5 ⋊ C3\n4. (C2^4 × C2) ⋊ C3\n5. (C2^3 × C2^2) ⋊ C3\n6. (C2^2 × C2^2 × C2) ⋊ C3\n\nNow, we need to show that each of these groups is non-isomorphic to each other and to the cyclic group C96 and the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nFirst, we can easily see that none of these groups are isomorphic to the cyclic group C96, as C96 is abelian, and all of these groups are non-abelian.\n\nNext, we can see that none of these groups are isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2. The group A4 × C4 × C2 has a normal subgroup of order 4 (C4 × C2), while none of the non-abelian groups of order 96 listed above have a normal subgroup of order 4.\n\nFinally, we need to show that these 6 non-abelian groups are pairwise non-isomorphic. We can do this by comparing their properties:\n\n1. C32 ⋊ C3 has an element of order 32, while none of the other groups have an element of order 32.\n2. (C16 × C2) ⋊ C3 has an element of order 16, while none of the other groups (except C32 ⋊ C3) have an element of order 16.\n3. C2^5 ⋊ C3 has an element of order 8, while none of the other groups (except C32 ⋊ C3 and (C16 × C2) ⋊ C3) have an element of order 8.\n4. (C2^4 × C2) ⋊ C3 has an element of order 4, while none of the other groups (except C32 ⋊ C3, (C16 × C2) ⋊ C3, and C2^5 ⋊ C3) have an element of order 4.\n5. (C2^3 × C2^2) ⋊ C3 has a normal subgroup of order 8, while none of the other groups (except C32 ⋊ C3, (C16 × C2) ⋊ C3, C2^5 ⋊ C3, and (C2^4 × C2) ⋊ C3) have a normal subgroup of order 8.\n6. (C2^2 × C2^2 × C2) ⋊ C3 has no normal subgroup of order 8, while all the other groups have a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nThus, these 6 non-abelian groups are pairwise non-isomorphic, and they are also non-isomorphic to the cyclic group C96 and the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2."
