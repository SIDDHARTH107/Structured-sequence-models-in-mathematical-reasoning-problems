They have collected the following data:\n\nHours studied per week: 10, 12, 15, 18, 20\nMath test scores: 75, 80, 85, 90, 92\n\nUsing regression analysis, what is the equation of the line of best fit to predict a student's math test score based on the number of hours they study per week?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line of best fit, we will use the least squares method. First, we need to find the means of the x-values (hours studied) and the y-values (math test scores).\n\nMean of x-values (hours studied): (10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20) / 5 = 75 / 5 = 15\nMean of y-values (math test scores): (75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 92) / 5 = 422 / 5 = 84.4\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (m) of the line. To do this, we will use the formula:\n\nm = Σ[(xi - x_mean)(yi - y_mean)] / Σ[(xi - x_mean)^2]\n\nwhere xi and yi are the individual data points, and x_mean and y_mean are the means of the x-values and y-values, respectively.\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n(10 - 15)(75 - 84.4) + (12 - 15)(80 - 84.4) + (15 - 15)(85 - 84.4) + (18 - 15)(90 - 84.4) + (20 - 15)(92 - 84.4) = -5(-9.4) + (-3)(-4.4) + (0)(0.6) + (3)(5.6) + (5)(7.6) = 47 + 13.2 + 0 + 16.8 + 38 = 115\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n(-5)^2 + (-3)^2 + (0)^2 + (3)^2 + (5)^2 = 25 + 9 + 0 + 9 + 25 = 68\n\nNow, we can find the slope (m):\nm = 115 / 68 ≈ 1.6912\n\nFinally, we need to find the y-intercept (b) using the formula:\n\nb = y_mean - m * x_mean\nb = 84.4 - 1.6912 * 15 ≈ 84.4 - 25.368 ≈ 59.032\n\nSo, the equation of the line of best fit is:\n\ny = 1.6912x + 59.032"
