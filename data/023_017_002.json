    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$, we need to use the formulas for Fourier series coefficients:\n\n$$a_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_0^L f(x) \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi nx}{L}\\right) dx$$\n\n$$b_n = \\frac{2}{L} \\int_0^L f(x) \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi nx}{L}\\right) dx$$\n\nGiven the function $f(x) = 5\\cos(2\\pi x/L) - 3\\sin(6\\pi x/L)$, we can see that it is already in the form of a Fourier series with $a_1 = 5$, $b_3 = -3$, and all other coefficients equal to zero. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$a_1 = 5, a_2 = 0, a_3 = 0, a_4 = 0$$\n$$b_1 = 0, b_2 = 0, b_3 = -3, b_4 = 0$$"
