    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the graphical method. First, let's plot the constraints on the coordinate plane.\n\n1. x + y >= 3\nThis inequality represents the region above and including the line x + y = 3. The line passes through the points (0, 3) and (3, 0).\n\n2. y >= 0\nThis inequality represents the region above and including the x-axis.\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region, which is the intersection of the regions defined by the constraints. In this case, the feasible region is the area above and to the right of the line x + y = 3, and above the x-axis.\n\nNext, we need to find the minimum value of the objective function 3x + 4y within the feasible region. To do this, we can analyze the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nThere are two vertices of interest:\n\n1. (0, 3): This point is on the x-axis and the line x + y = 3.\n2. (3, 0): This point is on the y-axis and the line x + y = 3.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at these vertices:\n\n1. At (0, 3): 3x + 4y = 3(0) + 4(3) = 12\n2. At (3, 0): 3x + 4y = 3(3) + 4(0) = 9\n\nThe minimum value of the objective function is 9, which occurs at the point (3, 0)."
