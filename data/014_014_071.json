    "message_2": "First, we need to create the 5x5 Playfair cipher matrix using the keyword \"SECRET\". Remove duplicate letters from the keyword and fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding \"J\" which is replaced by \"I\").\n\nThe matrix will look like this:\n\nS E C R T\nA B D F G\nH I K L M\nN O P Q U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNow, we will encrypt the plaintext message \"MATH IS FUN\". We need to split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters) and add an \"X\" to separate repeated letters or to complete the last pair if needed. In this case, we have:\n\nMA TH IX SF UN\n\nNow, we will find each pair of letters in the matrix and apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to its immediate right (wrapping around if necessary).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter immediately below it (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each with the letter in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nApplying these rules, we get:\n\nMA -> RK\nTH -> GK\nIX -> KV\nSF -> CE\nUN -> LM\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"RK GKV CE LM\"."
