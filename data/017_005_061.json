    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 125, which is a prime power (5^3), we know that G is a p-group. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exists a normal Sylow 5-subgroup in G. Let H be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G, so |H| = 5^2 = 25.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 125 and |H| = 25, we have |G/H| = 5. Since G/H has prime order, it is cyclic, i.e., G/H is isomorphic to Z_5.\n\nLet K be a subgroup of G such that K is isomorphic to G/H. By the correspondence theorem, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the subgroups of G/H and the subgroups of G containing H. Thus, K is a subgroup of G containing H, and |K| = 5.\n\nNow, we have |H| = 25 and |K| = 5, and gcd(25, 5) = 1. By the product formula for the order of the product of two subgroups, we have |HK| = |H||K| / |H ∩ K|. Since H and K have relatively prime orders, their intersection must be the identity element, so |H ∩ K| = 1. Therefore, |HK| = 25 * 5 / 1 = 125, which is the order of G.\n\nSince HK is a subgroup of G and |HK| = |G|, we have HK = G. Thus, G is the internal direct product of H and K, and G is isomorphic to H × K. Since H is a cyclic group of order 25 and K is a cyclic group of order 5, G is either cyclic (if H and K are both cyclic) or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
