    "message_1": "A circle has a diameter of 14cm. What is its circumference in cm?",
    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter. In this case, the diameter (d) is 14 cm.\n\nC = π * 14\n\nUsing the value of π as approximately 3.14159, we get:\n\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 14\nC ≈ 43.98226 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 43.98 cm."
