    "message_2": "To choose a committee of 2 people from a group of 5 people, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people, k is the number of people to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 and k = 2. So, we have:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!3!)\n\nC(5, 2) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(5, 2) = (120) / (2 × 6)\n\nC(5, 2) = 120 / 12\n\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 different ways to choose a committee of 2 people from a group of 5 people."
