    "message_2": "To solve the equation (3x-2)/(x+3) = (2x+1)/(2x-3), we will first eliminate the denominators by cross-multiplying.\n\n(3x - 2)(2x - 3) = (x + 3)(2x + 1)\n\nNow, we will expand both sides of the equation:\n\n6x^2 - 6x - 4x + 6 = 2x^2 + x + 6x + 3\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n6x^2 - 10x + 6 = 2x^2 + 7x + 3\n\nSubtract 2x^2, 7x, and 3 from both sides to set the equation to 0:\n\n4x^2 - 17x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 4, b = -17, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (17 ± √((-17)^2 - 4(4)(3))) / (2(4))\n\nx = (17 ± √(289 - 48)) / 8\n\nx = (17 ± √241) / 8\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = (17 + √241) / 8 and x = (17 - √241) / 8"
