    "message_1": "A ball is thrown upward from the top of a building 50 feet high, with an initial velocity of 30 feet per second. The ball's height h above the ground can be modeled by the function h(t)=-16t^2+30t+50, where t is time in seconds. \n\nWhat is the maximum height that the ball reaches and after how long does it return to the ground?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum height the ball reaches, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the function h(t) = -16t^2 + 30t + 50. The x-coordinate (t-value) of the vertex can be found using the formula t = -b / 2a, where a = -16 and b = 30.\n\nt = -30 / (2 * -16)\nt = -30 / -32\nt = 15/16 seconds\n\nNow, we can find the maximum height by plugging this t-value into the function h(t):\n\nh(15/16) = -16(15/16)^2 + 30(15/16) + 50\n\nh(15/16) = -16(225/256) + 30(15/16) + 50\nh(15/16) = (-3600/256) + (450/16) + 50\nh(15/16) = (56.25/256) + 28.125 + 50\nh(15/16) ≈ 78.125 feet\n\nThe maximum height the ball reaches is approximately 78.125 feet.\n\nTo find when the ball returns to the ground, we need to find when h(t) = 0:\n\n0 = -16t^2 + 30t + 50\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for t:\n\nt = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nt = (-30 ± √(30^2 - 4(-16)(50))) / (2 * -16)\nt = (-30 ± √(900 + 3200)) / -32\nt = (-30 ± √4100) / -32\nt = (-30 ± 10√41) / -32\n\nSince we are looking for the positive value of t, we will use the positive square root:\n\nt = (-30 + 10√41) / -32 ≈ 2.5 seconds\n\nThe ball returns to the ground after approximately 2.5 seconds."
