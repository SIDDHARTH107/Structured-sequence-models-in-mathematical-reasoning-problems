    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 3  2  1 | 12.5 |\n| 2  6 -1 | -4.8 |\n| 1 -1  5 |  9.1 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the x terms in the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - (2/3)R1\nR3 = R3 - (1/3)R1\n\n| 3    2    1 |  12.5  |\n| 0    4   -3 | -12.6  |\n| 0   -3    4 |   5.4  |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the y terms in the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 + (3/4)R2\n\n| 3    2    1 |  12.5  |\n| 0    4   -3 | -12.6  |\n| 0    0    1 |   0.9  |\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nz = 0.9\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\n4y - 3z = -12.6\n4y - 3(0.9) = -12.6\n4y = -12.6 + 2.7\n4y = -9.9\ny = -9.9 / 4\ny = -2.475\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\n3x + 2y + z = 12.5\n3x + 2(-2.475) + 0.9 = 12.5\n3x - 4.95 + 0.9 = 12.5\n3x = 12.5 + 4.05\n3x = 16.55\nx = 16.55 / 3\nx = 5.5167\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately:\n\nx ≈ 5.52\ny ≈ -2.48\nz ≈ 0.9\n\nHowever, since there is an error of ±0.2 in the given values, the actual values of x, y, and z could be slightly different. To account for this error, we can provide a range for each variable:\n\nx: 5.32 to 5.72\ny: -2.68 to -2.28\nz: 0.7 to 1.1"
