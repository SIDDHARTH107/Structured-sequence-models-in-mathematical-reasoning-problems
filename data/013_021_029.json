    "message_2": "In a Centipede Game with 5 stages, where both players have equal chances of winning and the cost of continuing for each player increases by a factor of 2 at each stage, the optimal strategy is to use backward induction.\n\nBackward induction involves analyzing the game from the last stage to the first stage, determining the best move for each player at each stage.\n\nStage 5: The game ends. If Player 1 reaches this stage, they will take the entire pot, as there is no further stage for Player 2 to continue.\n\nStage 4: If Player 2 reaches this stage, they will choose to take the pot, as they know that Player 1 will take the entire pot in Stage 5 if they continue.\n\nStage 3: Knowing that Player 2 will take the pot in Stage 4, Player 1 will choose to take the pot at Stage 3 to maximize their winnings.\n\nStage 2: Knowing that Player 1 will take the pot in Stage 3, Player 2 will choose to take the pot at Stage 2 to maximize their winnings.\n\nStage 1: Knowing that Player 2 will take the pot in Stage 2, Player 1 will choose to take the pot at Stage 1 to maximize their winnings.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy for both players is to take the pot at their first opportunity. This means that Player 1 will take the pot at Stage 1, and the game will not progress to further stages."
