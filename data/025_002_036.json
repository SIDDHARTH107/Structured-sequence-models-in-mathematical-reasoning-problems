    "message_2": "To find the intersection number of X and Y at the origin (0,0), we need to determine the multiplicity of the intersection point. We can do this by finding the tangent vectors of X and Y at the origin and comparing their directions.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation for X as follows:\n\n(x^2 + y^2)^2 - 4x^2y^2 = 0\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives of this equation with respect to x and y:\n\n∂/∂x: 4x(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy^2 = 0\n∂/∂y: 4y(x^2 + y^2) - 8x^2y = 0\n\nAt the origin (0,0), these partial derivatives become:\n\n∂/∂x: 0\n∂/∂y: 0\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives of the equation for Y with respect to x and y:\n\ny^2 - x^3 = 0\n\n∂/∂x: -3x^2\n∂/∂y: 2y\n\nAt the origin (0,0), these partial derivatives become:\n\n∂/∂x: 0\n∂/∂y: 0\n\nSince the tangent vectors of X and Y at the origin are both (0,0), we cannot determine the intersection number by comparing their directions. Instead, we will use the method of blowing up the origin.\n\nLet's introduce new coordinates (u,v) such that x = uv and y = u^2. Then, the equation for Y becomes:\n\n(u^2)^2 = (uv)^3\n\nu^4 = u^3v^3\n\nSince u ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by u^3:\n\nu = v^3\n\nNow, let's substitute x = uv and y = u^2 into the equation for X:\n\n((uv)^2 + (u^2)^2)^2 = 4(uv)^2(u^2)^2\n\n(u^4 + u^4)^2 = 4u^4v^2\n\n(2u^4)^2 = 4u^4v^2\n\nSince u ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by 2u^4:\n\n4 = 2v^2\n\nv^2 = 2\n\nNow, we have the equations u = v^3 and v^2 = 2. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\n(u^(2/3))^2 = 2\n\nu^(4/3) = 2\n\nThe intersection number of X and Y at the origin (0,0) is the number of distinct solutions for u in this equation. Since there are two distinct real solutions for u (u = 2^(3/4) and u = -2^(3/4)), the intersection number of X and Y at the origin is 2."
