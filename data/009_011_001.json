    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the value of b in the given differential equation:\n\ndy/dt = ky(b-y)\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation as a separable differential equation:\n\ndy/(b-y) = k dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫ dy/(b-y) = ∫ k dt\n\n-ln|b-y| = kt + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNow, let's solve for y:\n\nb-y = e^(-kt+C) = Ae^(-kt) (where A = e^C)\n\ny = b - Ae^(-kt)\n\nNow, we are given that initially (t=0), 10% of the population has the disease, so y(0) = 0.1:\n\n0.1 = b - A\n\nWe are also given that 10 days later (t=10), 30% of the population has the disease, so y(10) = 0.3:\n\n0.3 = b - Ae^(-k*10)\n\nWe know that k = 0.5, so we can substitute that into the equation:\n\n0.3 = b - Ae^(-0.5*10)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, A and b:\n\n0.1 = b - A\n0.3 = b - Ae^(-5)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by first solving for A in the first equation:\n\nA = b - 0.1\n\nNow, substitute this expression for A into the second equation:\n\n0.3 = b - (b - 0.1)e^(-5)\n\nNow, solve for b:\n\n0.3 = b - be^(-5) + 0.1e^(-5)\n\n0.3 - 0.1e^(-5) = b(1 - e^(-5))\n\nb = (0.3 - 0.1e^(-5))/(1 - e^(-5))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nb ≈ 0.391\n\nSo, the value of b is approximately 0.391."
