    "message_2": "To find the discrete logarithm of 5 base 3 in modulo 7 system, we need to find an integer x such that:\n\n3^x ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nWe can test different values of x to find the solution:\n\nx = 1: 3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\nx = 2: 3^2 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\nx = 3: 3^3 ≡ 6 (mod 7)\nx = 4: 3^4 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\nx = 5: 3^5 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the discrete logarithm of 5 base 3 in the modulo 7 system is x = 5."
