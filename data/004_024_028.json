    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, treating y as a function of x.\n\nGiven equation: x^3 - y^3 = 6xy\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(x^3) - d/dx(y^3) = d/dx(6xy)\n\nUsing the chain rule for d/dx(y^3), we get:\n\n3x^2 - 3y^2(dy/dx) = 6(dy/dx)x + 6y\n\nNow, we'll solve for dy/dx:\n\n3y^2(dy/dx) + 6x(dy/dx) = 3x^2 - 6y\n\nFactor out dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx(3y^2 + 6x) = 3x^2 - 6y\n\nNow, divide both sides by (3y^2 + 6x) to isolate dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (3x^2 - 6y) / (3y^2 + 6x)\n\nNow, we'll find the derivative at the point (3,3):\n\ndy/dx = (3(3)^2 - 6(3)) / (3(3)^2 + 6(3))\n\ndy/dx = (27 - 18) / (27 + 18)\n\ndy/dx = 9 / 45\n\ndy/dx = 1/5\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x at the point (3,3) is 1/5."
