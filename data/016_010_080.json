    "message_2": "The Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the interstices between three mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. In this case, we start with three circles with radii 1, 2, and 3.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the first circle added in the first generation. The Descartes Circle Theorem states that if four mutually tangent circles have curvatures (the reciprocal of the radius) k1, k2, k3, and k4, then:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n\nWe know the curvatures of the first three circles: k1 = 1, k2 = 1/2, and k3 = 1/3. We can solve for the curvature of the fourth circle, k4:\n\n(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4)^2 = 2(k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2 + k4^2)\n(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + k4)^2 = 2(1^2 + (1/2)^2 + (1/3)^2 + k4^2)\n\nSolving for k4, we get k4 = 1/6. Therefore, the radius of the first circle added is 6.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of circles in the 6th generation. The number of circles added in each generation follows the sequence:\n\n3 (initial circles) + 1 (first generation) + 3 (second generation) + 6 (third generation) + 12 (fourth generation) + 24 (fifth generation) + 48 (sixth generation)\n\nAdding these numbers together, we get:\n\n3 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 97\n\nSo, there are 97 circles in the 6th generation of the Apollonian gasket when the starting circles have radii of 1, 2, and 3."
