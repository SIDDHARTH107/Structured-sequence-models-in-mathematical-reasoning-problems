    "message_2": "To perform linear discriminant analysis (LDA), we need to calculate the discriminant scores for both male and female groups and compare them. The discriminant score is given by:\n\nD = (X - mean) * inv(covariance_matrix) * (X - mean)^T\n\nwhere X is the height and weight measurements of the new person, mean is the mean vector for each group, inv(covariance_matrix) is the inverse of the covariance matrix for each group, and ^T denotes the transpose of a vector.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant score for the male group:\n\nX - mean_male = (180 - 175, 70 - 75) = (5, -5)\n\ninv(covariance_matrix_male) = [[1/50, 0], [0, 1/100]] (since it's a diagonal matrix)\n\nD_male = (5, -5) * [[1/50, 0], [0, 1/100]] * (5, -5)^T\n       = (5/50, -5/100) * (5, -5)^T\n       = (0.1, -0.05) * (5, -5)^T\n       = 0.1 * 5 + (-0.05) * (-5)\n       = 0.5 + 0.25\n       = 0.75\n\nNow, let's calculate the discriminant score for the female group:\n\nX - mean_female = (180 - 162.5, 70 - 60) = (17.5, 10)\n\ninv(covariance_matrix_female) = [[0.02, -0.01], [-0.01, 0.04]] (calculated using a matrix inverse calculator)\n\nD_female = (17.5, 10) * [[0.02, -0.01], [-0.01, 0.04]] * (17.5, 10)^T\n         = (0.25, 0.3) * (17.5, 10)^T\n         = 0.25 * 17.5 + 0.3 * 10\n         = 4.375 + 3\n         = 7.375\n\nSince D_male < D_female, the predicted gender for the new person (180cm, 70kg) using linear discriminant analysis is female."
