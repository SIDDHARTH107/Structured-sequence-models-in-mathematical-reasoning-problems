    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (3x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x - 1) as x approaches 1, we can try to simplify the function first. We can do this by factoring the numerator and see if there is a common factor with the denominator that can be canceled out.\n\nf(x) = (3x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x - 1)\n\nWe can use polynomial long division or synthetic division to divide the numerator by the denominator. In this case, let's use synthetic division:\n\nDividing (3x^2 - 2x + 1) by (x - 1):\n\n1 |  3  -2  1\n  |  3   1\n  ------------\n     3   1  2\n\nSo, the result of the division is 3x + 1 with a remainder of 2. Therefore, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(x) = 3x + 1 + 2 / (x - 1)\n\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 1:\n\nlim (x->1) (3x + 1 + 2 / (x - 1))\n\nAs x approaches 1, the term 2 / (x - 1) approaches 2 / (1 - 1) = 2 / 0, which is undefined. However, the limit of the rest of the function (3x + 1) as x approaches 1 is well-defined:\n\nlim (x->1) (3x + 1) = 3(1) + 1 = 4\n\nSince the limit of the function (3x + 1) as x approaches 1 exists and is equal to 4, the limit of the original function f(x) = (3x^2 - 2x + 1) / (x - 1) as x approaches 1 is also 4."
