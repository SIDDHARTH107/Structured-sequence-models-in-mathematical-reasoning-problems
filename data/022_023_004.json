    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the d'Alembert's formula for the one-dimensional wave equation. The formula is given by:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} [f(x+ct) + f(x-ct)] + \\frac{1}{2c} \\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} g(s) ds$$\n\nwhere $f(x) = u(x,0)$ and $g(x) = u_t(x,0)$ are the initial conditions.\n\nIn our case, $f(x) = 1 + x^2$ and $g(x) = 0$. So, the d'Alembert's formula becomes:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} [(1 + (x+ct)^2) + (1 + (x-ct)^2)]$$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $u(x,t)$ at the point $x=1$ and at the time $t=\\frac{3}{c}$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$u(1,\\frac{3}{c}) = \\frac{1}{2} [(1 + (1+c\\frac{3}{c})^2) + (1 + (1-c\\frac{3}{c})^2)]$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$u(1,\\frac{3}{c}) = \\frac{1}{2} [(1 + (1+3)^2) + (1 + (1-3)^2)]$$\n\n$$u(1,\\frac{3}{c}) = \\frac{1}{2} [(1 + 16) + (1 + 4)]$$\n\n$$u(1,\\frac{3}{c}) = \\frac{1}{2} [17 + 5]$$\n\n$$u(1,\\frac{3}{c}) = \\frac{1}{2} [22]$$\n\n$$u(1,\\frac{3}{c}) = 11$$\n\nSo, the value of $u(x,t)$ at the point $x=1$ and at the time $t=\\frac{3}{c}$ is 11."
