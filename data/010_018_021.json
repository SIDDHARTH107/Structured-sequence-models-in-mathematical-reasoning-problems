    "message_2": "Let's analyze the given Morse-Smale complex on a closed surface. We have 12 critical points and 16 saddle connections. Recall that a Morse-Smale complex has critical points of three types: minima, maxima, and saddles.\n\nLet M, S, and N be the number of minima, saddles, and maxima, respectively. Then, we have:\n\nM + S + N = 12 (total critical points)\n\nNow, let's use the Euler characteristic formula for a closed surface:\n\nχ = M - S + N\n\nSince the surface is closed, the Euler characteristic χ depends on the surface's topology. For example, if the surface is a sphere, χ = 2; if it's a torus, χ = 0.\n\nWe also know that each saddle connection connects a minimum to a maximum or a maximum to a minimum. Thus, the number of saddle connections is equal to the number of minimum-maximum pairs. Let P be the number of minimum-maximum pairs. Then:\n\nP = 16\n\nNow, we can express P in terms of M and N:\n\nP = M * N\n\nSo, we have:\n\nM * N = 16\n\nWe have three equations with three unknowns (M, S, and N). We can solve this system of equations to find the values of M, S, and N, which will depend on the Euler characteristic χ.\n\nOnce we have the values of M, S, and N, we can determine the number of connected components that the level set of a regular value intersects with. In a Morse-Smale complex, the level set of a regular value intersects with the descending manifolds of the saddles. Each saddle contributes two connected components to the level set (one for each descending manifold). Therefore, the number of connected components that the level set of a regular value intersects with is:\n\n2 * S\n\nSo, we need to find the value of S to answer the question."
