Therefore, the integral converges, and we can write:\n\nF(s) = 2 * [0 - (-2) * (1/(2π^2s^2)) * F(s)].\n\nSolving for F(s):\n\nF(s) = 4/(4π^2s^2) * F(s).\n\nDividing both sides by F(s):\n\n1 = 4/(4π^2s^2).\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4π^2s^2:\n\n4π^2s^2 = 4.\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\nπ^2s^2 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform of the function f(t) = e^(-2|t|) is:\n\nF(s) = 1/(π^2s^2)."
