    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company has a total of 400 hours of labor, 300 pounds of raw materials, and 500 cubic feet of storage space available. Product A requires 2 hours of labor, 3 pounds of material, and 4 cubic feet of storage space to produce. Product B requires 3 hours of labor, 2 pounds of material, and 5 cubic feet of storage space to produce. \nWhat's the optimal production quantity of each product that the company should manufacture in order to maximize their profit, if product A has a profit of $60 per unit and product B has a profit of $80 per unit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\nLabor: 2x + 3y ≤ 400\nMaterials: 3x + 2y ≤ 300\nStorage: 4x + 5y ≤ 500\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit:\n\nProfit = 60x + 80y\n\nTo find the optimal production quantity, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and then find the vertices of the feasible region. Finally, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nGraphing the constraints:\n\nx = (400 - 3y) / 2\ny = (400 - 2x) / 3\n\nx = (300 - 2y) / 3\ny = (300 - 3x) / 2\n\nx = (500 - 5y) / 4\ny = (500 - 4x) / 5\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the intersection points of the constraint lines. The vertices are:\n\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 100)\nC(60, 80)\nD(100, 0)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nA(0, 0): Profit = 60(0) + 80(0) = $0\nB(0, 100): Profit = 60(0) + 80(100) = $8,000\nC(60, 80): Profit = 60(60) + 80(80) = $10,800\nD(100, 0): Profit = 60(100) + 80(0) = $6,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex C(60, 80), where the company should produce 60 units of Product A and 80 units of Product B for a total profit of $10,800."
