    "message_2": "To prove that X is a compact space, we need to show that every open cover of X has a finite subcover. We are given that this property holds, so we can conclude that X is indeed a compact space.\n\nNow, let's show that the closed interval [0,1] with the topology induced by the standard metric on R is compact. To do this, we will use the Heine-Borel theorem, which states that a subset of R is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.\n\nFirst, we show that [0,1] is closed. Consider a limit point x of [0,1]. This means that for every open neighborhood U of x, there exists a point y in [0,1] such that y is in U and y ≠ x. Since x is a limit point, it must be the case that x is either in [0,1] or x is a limit point of the boundary points 0 and 1. If x is in [0,1], then [0,1] contains all its limit points and is therefore closed. If x is a limit point of 0 or 1, then x must be either 0 or 1, which are also in [0,1], so [0,1] is still closed.\n\nNext, we show that [0,1] is bounded. By definition, a set is bounded if there exists a real number M such that the absolute value of the difference between any two points in the set is less than or equal to M. In this case, for any two points x and y in [0,1], we have:\n\n0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n\nTaking the absolute value of the difference between x and y, we get:\n\n0 ≤ |x - y| ≤ 1\n\nThus, [0,1] is bounded with M = 1.\n\nSince [0,1] is both closed and bounded, by the Heine-Borel theorem, it is compact."
