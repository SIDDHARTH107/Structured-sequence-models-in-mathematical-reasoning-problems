    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angles opposite to these sides as A, B, and C, respectively. In this case, we have:\n\na = 10\nb = 12\nc = 15\n\nWe want to find the largest angle, which is the angle opposite the longest side. The longest side is c, so we want to find angle C.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c, we get:\n\n15^2 = 10^2 + 12^2 - 2 * 10 * 12 * cos(C)\n\nSolving for cos(C):\n\n225 = 100 + 144 - 240 * cos(C)\n225 = 244 - 240 * cos(C)\n-19 = -240 * cos(C)\n\nNow, divide by -240:\n\ncos(C) = 19/240\n\nNow, we need to find the angle C by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the value:\n\nC = arccos(19/240)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nC ≈ 81.79°\n\nSo, the largest angle in the triangle is approximately 81.79°."
