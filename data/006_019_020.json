    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of exactly x successes (voters supporting candidate A) in n trials (total voters), C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, p is the probability of success (0.6 in this case), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (0.4 in this case).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of exactly 300 voters supporting candidate A out of 500 voters. So, we have:\n\nn = 500 (total voters)\nx = 300 (voters supporting candidate A)\np = 0.6 (probability of supporting candidate A)\n1-p = 0.4 (probability of not supporting candidate A)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(300) = C(500, 300) * 0.6^300 * 0.4^200\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(500, 300), which is the number of combinations of 500 items taken 300 at a time. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, x) = n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nC(500, 300) = 500! / (300! * 200!)\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(300) = (500! / (300! * 200!)) * 0.6^300 * 0.4^200\n\nCalculating this value, we get:\n\nP(300) â‰ˆ 0.029531\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 300 out of 500 voters will vote for candidate A is approximately 0.029531 or 2.9531%."
