    "message_2": "To determine the radius of convergence and interval of convergence for the given power series, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of a series is L, then:\n\n1. If L < 1, the series converges.\n2. If L > 1, the series diverges.\n3. If L = 1, the test is inconclusive.\n\nLet's apply the Ratio Test to the given power series:\n\nlim (n→∞) |(a_(n+1)) / (a_n)| = lim (n→∞) |((2^(n+1) * (x-1)^(n+1)) / (n+1)!) / ((2^n * (x-1)^n) / n!)|\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nlim (n→∞) |(2^(n+1) * (x-1)^(n+1) * n!) / (2^n * (x-1)^n * (n+1)!)|\n\nNow, divide the terms:\n\nlim (n→∞) |(2 * (x-1) * 2^n * (x-1)^n * n!) / (2^n * (x-1)^n * (n+1)(n)!)|\n\nSome terms cancel out:\n\nlim (n→∞) |(2 * (x-1)) / (n+1)|\n\nFor the series to converge, this limit must be less than 1:\n\n|(2 * (x-1)) / (n+1)| < 1\n\nSince the limit does not depend on n, we can remove the limit notation:\n\n|(2 * (x-1))| < 1\n\nNow, we can find the interval of convergence:\n\n-1 < 2 * (x-1) < 1\n\nAdd 1 to all sides:\n\n0 < 2 * (x-1) < 2\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n0 < x-1 < 1\n\nAdd 1 to all sides:\n\n1 < x < 2\n\nThe interval of convergence is (1, 2).\n\nNow, let's find the radius of convergence. The radius of convergence is half the length of the interval of convergence:\n\nR = (2 - 1) / 2 = 1 / 2\n\nSo, the radius of convergence is 1/2.\n\nIn conclusion, the radius of convergence for the given power series is 1/2, and the interval of convergence is (1, 2)."
