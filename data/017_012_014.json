    "message_2": "Let H = ⟨a⟩ and K = ⟨b⟩, where a has order 4 and b has order 2. Since |H| = 4 and |K| = 2, we have |H ∩ K| = 1, which means H ∩ K = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. Also, since x is not in H or K, we have |H ∪ K ∪ {x}| = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\nNow, consider the set S = {a^i * b^j * x^k | 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, 0 ≤ j ≤ 1, 0 ≤ k ≤ 1}. Since H, K, and x are all distinct, we have |S| = 16. We claim that S is a subgroup of G. To show this, we need to verify the following properties:\n\n1. Closure: For any two elements a^i * b^j * x^k and a^m * b^n * x^p in S, their product a^i * b^j * x^k * a^m * b^n * x^p is also in S. Since G is a group, the product is in G, and since the exponents are taken modulo the orders of a, b, and x, the product is in S.\n\n2. Identity: The identity element e is in S, as a^0 * b^0 * x^0 = e.\n\n3. Inverses: For any element a^i * b^j * x^k in S, its inverse is a^(-i) * b^(-j) * x^(-k) (since a and b have finite orders, their inverses are a^(4-i) and b^(2-j), and x has an inverse x^(-1) in G). Since the exponents are taken modulo the orders of a, b, and x, the inverse is in S.\n\nTherefore, S is a subgroup of G, and since |S| = |G|, we have S = G.\n\nNow, let's show that G is non-abelian. Consider the elements a * x and b * x in G. We have (a * x) * (b * x) = a * (x * b) * x. If G were abelian, we would have x * b = b * x, and thus (a * x) * (b * x) = a * b * x^2. However, since x is not in H or K, x^2 cannot be equal to b, so x * b ≠ b * x. Therefore, G is non-abelian.\n\nFinally, we know that there is only one non-abelian group of order 16 up to isomorphism, which is the dihedral group D_8. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 16, D_8."
