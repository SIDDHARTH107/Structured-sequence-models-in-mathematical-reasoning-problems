    "message_1": "In a manufacturing facility, the probability of an electrical accident occurring in a week is 0.2, while the probability of a chemical accident occurring is 0.1. What is the probability of at least one of these two types of accidents occurring in the next two weeks?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one of these two types of accidents occurring in the next two weeks, we can first find the probability of neither accident occurring in a single week and then use that to find the probability of at least one accident occurring in the next two weeks.\n\nThe probability of an electrical accident not occurring in a week is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\nThe probability of a chemical accident not occurring in a week is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nThe probability of neither accident occurring in a single week is the product of the probabilities of each not occurring: 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.72.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one accident occurring in the next two weeks. To do this, we can find the probability of neither accident occurring in both weeks and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of neither accident occurring in both weeks is the product of the probabilities of neither occurring in each week: 0.72 * 0.72 = 0.5184.\n\nFinally, the probability of at least one accident occurring in the next two weeks is 1 - 0.5184 = 0.4816 or 48.16%."
