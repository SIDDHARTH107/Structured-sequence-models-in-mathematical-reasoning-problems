    "message_1": "A mass-spring system is given by the differential equation:\n$$my'' + by' + ky =0$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the object, $b$ is the damping constant, $k$ is the spring constant, and $y(t)$ is the displacement of the object from its equilibrium position at time $t$.\n\nIf a mass of 2 kg is attached to a spring with a stiffness of 10 N/m and a damping coefficient of 4 Ns/m, and the initial displacement and velocity are 0.2 m and 0.3 m/s, respectively, what is the equation of motion?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for this mass-spring system, we can plug in the given values for mass (m), damping constant (b), and spring constant (k) into the differential equation:\n\n$$2y'' + 4y' + 10y = 0$$\n\nNow, we need to solve this second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. We can start by assuming a solution of the form:\n\n$$y(t) = e^{rt}$$\n\nwhere r is a constant. Taking the first and second derivatives of y(t) with respect to time t, we get:\n\n$$y'(t) = re^{rt}$$\n$$y''(t) = r^2e^{rt}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the differential equation, we get:\n\n$$2(r^2e^{rt}) + 4(re^{rt}) + 10(e^{rt}) = 0$$\n\nWe can factor out the exponential term, since it's never zero:\n\n$$e^{rt}(2r^2 + 4r + 10) = 0$$\n\nNow, we can focus on finding the roots of the quadratic equation:\n\n$$2r^2 + 4r + 10 = 0$$\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\n$$r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = 4, and c = 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$r = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4(2)(10)}}{2(2)}$$\n$$r = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-64}}{4}$$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we have complex roots:\n\n$$r = -1 \\pm 4i$$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution for the equation of motion as a linear combination of the real and imaginary parts of the complex exponential function:\n\n$$y(t) = e^{-t}(A\\cos(4t) + B\\sin(4t))$$\n\nTo find the constants A and B, we can use the initial conditions:\n\n1. Initial displacement: $y(0) = 0.2$ m\n2. Initial velocity: $y'(0) = 0.3$ m/s\n\nApplying the initial displacement condition:\n\n$$y(0) = e^{-0}(A\\cos(4(0)) + B\\sin(4(0))) = A = 0.2$$\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of y(t):\n\n$$y'(t) = -e^{-t}(A\\cos(4t) + B\\sin(4t)) + e^{-t}(-4A\\sin(4t) + 4B\\cos(4t))$$\n\nApplying the initial velocity condition:\n\n$$y'(0) = -e^{-0}(0.2\\cos(4(0)) + B\\sin(4(0))) + e^{-0}(-4(0.2)\\sin(4(0)) + 4B\\cos(4(0))) = 0.3$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$4B = 0.3$$\n\nSolving for B:\n\n$$B = \\frac{0.3}{4} = 0.075$$\n\nNow, we have the constants A and B, so we can write the equation of motion for the mass-spring system:\n\n$$y(t) = e^{-t}(0.2\\cos(4t) + 0.075\\sin(4t))$$"
