    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parametrize the surface as follows:\nS(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\nSu = ∂S/∂u = (1, 0, 2u)\nSv = ∂S/∂v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\nSuu = ∂²S/∂u² = (0, 0, 2)\nSuv = ∂²S/∂u∂v = (0, 0, 0)\nSvv = ∂²S/∂v² = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form:\nE = <Su, Su> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <Su, Sv> = 2uv\nG = <Sv, Sv> = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have:\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 2(1)(1) = 2\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\nL = <Suu, N> = -2\nM = <Suv, N> = 0\nN = <Svv, N> = -2\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface at the point (1, 1, 2).\n\nFinally, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nK = (-2 * -2 - 0^2) / (5 * 5 - 2^2) = 4 / 21\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2) is 4/21."
