    "message_2": "To find the probability of a randomly selected citizen from country X being supportive of political party Y, we can use the information from the survey. \n\nThe survey showed that 650 out of 1000 citizens were in favor of party Y. So, the probability can be calculated as:\n\nProbability = (Number of citizens in favor of party Y) / (Total number of citizens surveyed)\n\nProbability = 650 / 1000\n\nProbability = 0.65 or 65%\n\nSo, the probability of a randomly selected citizen from country X being supportive of political party Y is 65%. Keep in mind that this is an estimate based on the survey and may not be the exact probability for the entire population of country X."
