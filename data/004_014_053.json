    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the curve y = x^2 between x = 1 and x = 4 around the x-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of each infinitesimally small disk along the x-axis.\n\nThe area of each disk is given by the formula A(x) = π * (y(x))^2, where y(x) is the function we're rotating around the x-axis. In this case, y(x) = x^2.\n\nSo, A(x) = π * (x^2)^2 = π * x^4.\n\nNow, we need to integrate A(x) from x = 1 to x = 4:\n\nVolume = ∫[1, 4] π * x^4 dx\n\nTo integrate, we can use the power rule: ∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C. \n\nVolume = [π * (x^5)/5] evaluated from 1 to 4\n\nVolume = π * [(4^5)/5 - (1^5)/5]\n\nVolume = π * [(1024 - 1)/5]\n\nVolume = π * (1023/5)\n\nVolume ≈ 644.67 cubic units.\n\nSo, the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the curve y = x^2 between x = 1 and x = 4 around the x-axis is approximately 644.67 cubic units."
