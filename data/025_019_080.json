    "message_2": "Let $X$ be a smooth cubic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^4$, and let $F(X)$ be the Fano variety of lines on $X$. The degree of $F(X)$ can be computed using the intersection theory on the Chow ring of the Hilbert scheme of lines in $\\mathbb{P}^4$.\n\nThe Hilbert scheme of lines in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ is isomorphic to the Grassmannian $G(1,4)$ of lines in $\\mathbb{P}^4$. Let $c_1$ and $c_2$ be the first and second Chern classes of the tautological rank-2 vector bundle on $G(1,4)$. The Chow ring of $G(1,4)$ is generated by $c_1$ and $c_2$, and we have the following relations:\n\n$c_1^4 = 0$\n$c_1^3 = 6c_2$\n$c_1^2c_2 = 6c_2^2$\n$c_1c_2^2 = 0$\n$c_2^3 = 0$\n\nNow, let $H$ be the hyperplane class of $\\mathbb{P}^4$. The class of a line in $X$ is given by $[L] = 3H^2$. The degree of $F(X)$ is the intersection number of $3H^2$ with itself three times in the Chow ring of $G(1,4)$:\n\n$deg(F(X)) = (3H^2)^3 = 27H^6$\n\nUsing the relations between the Chern classes and the hyperplane class, we can compute the degree of $F(X)$:\n\n$H^6 = c_1^3 = 6c_2$\n\nSo, the degree of $F(X)$ is:\n\n$deg(F(X)) = 27H^6 = 27(6c_2) = 162c_2$\n\nTherefore, the degree of the Fano variety of lines in a smooth cubic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ is 162."
