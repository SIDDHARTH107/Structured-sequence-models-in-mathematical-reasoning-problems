    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve E(F_7), we need to check all possible combinations of x and y in the finite field F_7 and see if they satisfy the equation y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 5.\n\nThe finite field F_7 has elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We will check all possible combinations of x and y in F_7.\n\nFor each x value, we will calculate the right side of the equation (x^3 + 2x + 5) and check if there is a corresponding y value such that y^2 is congruent to the result modulo 7.\n\nx = 0:\n0^3 + 2*0 + 5 = 5\nThere is no y such that y^2 ≡ 5 (mod 7).\n\nx = 1:\n1^3 + 2*1 + 5 = 8 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\ny^2 ≡ 1 (mod 7) has two solutions: y = 1 and y = 6.\n\nx = 2:\n2^3 + 2*2 + 5 = 21 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\ny^2 ≡ 0 (mod 7) has one solution: y = 0.\n\nx = 3:\n3^3 + 2*3 + 5 = 44 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\nThere is no y such that y^2 ≡ 2 (mod 7).\n\nx = 4:\n4^3 + 2*4 + 5 = 77 ≡ 0 (mod 7)\ny^2 ≡ 0 (mod 7) has one solution: y = 0.\n\nx = 5:\n5^3 + 2*5 + 5 = 140 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\ny^2 ≡ 1 (mod 7) has two solutions: y = 1 and y = 6.\n\nx = 6:\n6^3 + 2*6 + 5 = 233 ≡ 4 (mod 7)\ny^2 ≡ 4 (mod 7) has two solutions: y = 2 and y = 5.\n\nSo, we have found the following points on E(F_7):\n(1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (4, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 2), and (6, 5).\n\nIn addition to these points, there is also the point at infinity, which is always on an elliptic curve.\n\nTherefore, the number of points on E(F_7) is 8 + 1 = 9."
