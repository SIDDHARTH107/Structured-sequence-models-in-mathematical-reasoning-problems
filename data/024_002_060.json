    "message_2": "To find the geodesic curve connecting points A and B on the surface of the sphere, we can use the concept of great circles. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and it is the shortest path between any two points on the sphere's surface.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the plane containing points A, B, and the center of the sphere, C(0, 0, 0). The normal vector of the plane can be found by taking the cross product of the position vectors of A and B:\n\nN = A × B = (0, 0, 2) × (2, 0, 0) = (0, -4, 0)\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the plane using the normal vector and a point on the plane (we can use point A):\n\n0(x - 0) - 4(y - 0) + 0(z - 2) = 0\n-4y = 0\ny = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is y = 0, which is the xz-plane.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of this plane with the sphere of radius 2. The equation of the sphere is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2\nx^2 + z^2 = 4\n\nSince the plane is y = 0, we can substitute this into the sphere's equation:\n\nx^2 + 0^2 + z^2 = 4\nx^2 + z^2 = 4\n\nThis is the equation of a circle with radius 2 in the xz-plane. The geodesic curve connecting points A and B on the surface of the sphere is the arc of this circle between A and B. The parametric equations for this circle are:\n\nx(t) = 2 * cos(t)\nz(t) = 2 * sin(t)\n\nwhere t is the angle in radians from the positive x-axis. Since A is at (0, 0, 2) and B is at (2, 0, 0), we can find the corresponding angles:\n\nt_A = π/2\nt_B = 0\n\nSo, the geodesic curve connecting points A and B on the surface of the sphere can be represented by the parametric equations:\n\nx(t) = 2 * cos(t)\ny(t) = 0\nz(t) = 2 * sin(t)\n\nfor t in the interval [0, π/2]."
