    "message_1": "Sure, here's a question for a math student to solve:\n\nA contagious disease is spreading in a population of 200,000 people, with an average of 100 new cases per day. The recovery rate is assumed to be 10% per day. Use a differential equation model to predict how many new cases will be reported after 5 days.",
    "message_2": "To model the spread of the disease, we can use the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model. In this model, we have three compartments: S(t) for the number of susceptible individuals, I(t) for the number of infected individuals, and R(t) for the number of recovered individuals. The total population N is constant and given by N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t).\n\nWe are given that the initial number of infected individuals is 100, and the recovery rate is 10% per day. Let's denote the infection rate as β and the recovery rate as γ. In our case, γ = 0.1.\n\nThe SIR model is described by the following system of differential equations:\n\ndS/dt = -β * S * I / N\ndI/dt = β * S * I / N - γ * I\ndR/dt = γ * I\n\nWe need to find the number of new cases after 5 days, which is given by the change in the number of infected individuals, ΔI(5). To do this, we need to solve the system of differential equations.\n\nHowever, we are not given the infection rate β. Without this information, we cannot solve the system of differential equations and predict the number of new cases after 5 days. If you can provide the infection rate or any additional information, we can proceed with the solution."
