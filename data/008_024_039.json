    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the given system of linear equations:\n\nx + 2y + z = 8 (1)\n\n2x + 4y + 2z = 16 (2)\n\n3x + 6y + 3z = 24 (3)\n\nNow, let's divide equation (2) by 2 and equation (3) by 3:\n\nx + 2y + z = 8 (1)\n\nx + 2y + z = 8 (2')\n\nx + 2y + z = 8 (3')\n\nAs we can see, all three equations are the same. This means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, as they all lie on the same plane. To find the general solution, we can express one variable in terms of the other two. Let's express z in terms of x and y:\n\nz = 8 - x - 2y\n\nThe general solution for this system of linear equations is:\n\n(x, y, 8 - x - 2y)"
