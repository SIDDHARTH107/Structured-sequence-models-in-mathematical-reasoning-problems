    "message_2": "To determine the magnetic field at a point at a distance of 5 mm from the wire's center, we can use Ampere's Law. Ampere's Law states that the magnetic field (B) around a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current in the wire, and r is the distance from the center of the wire to the point where we want to find the magnetic field.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n\nI = 3 A (current)\nr = 5 mm = 0.005 m (distance from the center of the wire)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 0.005 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm * 3 A) / (2 * 0.005 m)\n\nNow, we can simplify and calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (12 × 10^(-7) Tm) / (0.01 m)\nB = 1.2 × 10^(-6) T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a point at a distance of 5 mm from the wire's center is 1.2 × 10^(-6) T (Tesla)."
