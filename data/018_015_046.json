Repeat the process by finding the Cartesian product of B and A, then find the intersection of B with A. Show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nNow let's find the intersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B. This is the set of elements that are common to both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B x A. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A.\n\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow let's find the intersection of B and A, denoted as B ∩ A. This is the set of elements that are common to both B and A.\n\nB ∩ A = {2, 3}\n\nNow, let's compare the Cartesian products A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, A x B ≠ B x A, which means the Cartesian product is not commutative.\n\nNow let's compare the intersections A ∩ B and B ∩ A:\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\nB ∩ A = {2, 3}\n\nIn this case, A ∩ B = B ∩ A, which means the intersection is commutative.\n\nHowever, the original question asked to show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection. This means we need to show that (A x B) ∩ (B x A) ≠ (B x A) ∩ (A x B).\n\n(A x B) ∩ (B x A) = {}\n(B x A) ∩ (A x B) = {}\n\nIn this case, the intersection of the Cartesian products is the empty set, which means (A x B) ∩ (B x A) = (B x A) ∩ (A x B). However, this does not contradict the fact that the Cartesian product itself is not commutative, as we have already shown that A x B ≠ B x A. The intersection operation is commutative, but the Cartesian product operation is not."
