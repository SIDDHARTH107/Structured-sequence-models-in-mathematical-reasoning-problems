    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Since A contains odd integers, let's assume U contains all integers from 1 to 6. So, U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nNow, the complement of A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in U that are not in A. So, A' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}.\n\nComparing the elements of A and U, we can see that A' = {2, 4, 6}.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection between A and its complement A'. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ A' = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ A'}\n\nComparing the elements of A and A', we can see that there are no common elements between A and A'. Therefore, the intersection of A and A' is the empty set:\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅\n\nThis demonstrates that the intersection between a set and its complement is always the empty set."
