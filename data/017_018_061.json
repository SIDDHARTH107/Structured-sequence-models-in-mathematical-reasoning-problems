    "message_2": "To find all possible isomorphism classes of groups of order 32, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. The prime factorization of 32 is 2^5, so the possible isomorphism classes of abelian groups of order 32 are:\n\n1. Z_32 (cyclic)\n2. Z_16 × Z_2\n3. Z_8 × Z_4\n4. Z_8 × Z_2 × Z_2\n5. Z_4 × Z_4 × Z_2\n6. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2\n7. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2\n\nNow, let's consider the non-abelian groups. We know that a group of order 32 cannot be dihedral since the dihedral group of order 32, D_16, has order 2 * 16 = 32, which is not a power of 2. Therefore, there are no dihedral groups of order 32.\n\nTo find non-abelian groups, we can use the fact that a group of order 2^5 has a non-trivial center. Let G be a non-abelian group of order 32. Then, the center Z(G) is non-trivial, and |Z(G)| is a power of 2. The possible orders for Z(G) are 2, 4, 8, and 16. We will consider each case:\n\n1. |Z(G)| = 2: In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 16, which is isomorphic to one of the abelian groups of order 16. However, this would imply that G is abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, there are no non-abelian groups with a center of order 2.\n\n2. |Z(G)| = 4: In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 8, which is isomorphic to one of the abelian groups of order 8 (Z_8 or Z_4 × Z_2). There are two non-abelian groups in this case, which we will denote as G1 and G2.\n\n3. |Z(G)| = 8: In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 4, which is isomorphic to one of the abelian groups of order 4 (Z_4 or Z_2 × Z_2). There is one non-abelian group in this case, which we will denote as G3.\n\n4. |Z(G)| = 16: In this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 2, which is isomorphic to Z_2. However, this would imply that G is abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian. Therefore, there are no non-abelian groups with a center of order 16.\n\nIn summary, there are 7 abelian isomorphism classes and 3 non-abelian isomorphism classes of groups of order 32. The abelian classes are:\n\n1. Z_32 (cyclic)\n2. Z_16 × Z_2\n3. Z_8 × Z_4\n4. Z_8 × Z_2 × Z_2\n5. Z_4 × Z_4 × Z_2\n6. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2\n7. Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2\n\nThe non-abelian classes are:\n\n1. G1 (non-abelian with |Z(G)| = 4)\n2. G2 (non-abelian with |Z(G)| = 4)\n3. G3 (non-abelian with |Z(G)| = 8)\n\nThere are no dihedral groups of order 32."
