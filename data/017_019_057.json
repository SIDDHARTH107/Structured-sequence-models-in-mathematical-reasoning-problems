    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we will use the Sylow theorems and group theory concepts. Let G be a group of order 36. Since 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, by the Sylow theorems, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, 3, or 9 (number of Sylow 2-subgroups)\n2. n_3 = 1 or 4 (number of Sylow 3-subgroups)\n\nWe will analyze these cases and determine the possible structures of G.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. The order of P_2 * P_3 is |P_2| * |P_3| = 4 * 9 = 36, which is the order of G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is C4 × C9 (cyclic group of order 4 and cyclic group of order 9). Since C4 × C9 is isomorphic to C36, we have one possibility: G ≅ C36.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. Then, the order of P_2 * P_3 is |P_2| * |P_3| = 4 * 9 = 36, which is the order of G. Therefore, G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. There are two possibilities for P_2: C4 or C2 × C2. Also, there are two possibilities for P_3: C9 or C3 × C3. This gives us four possible semidirect products, but only two of them are non-abelian: C4 ⋊ C3 × C3 and C2 × C2 ⋊ C3 × C3. These two groups are isomorphic to A4 × C3 and one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, respectively.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3 or 9 and n_3 = 1 or 4\nIn these cases, G does not have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup or a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Therefore, G cannot be a direct product or a semidirect product of its Sylow subgroups. However, it can be shown that there are no other possibilities for the structure of G in these cases.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 36: the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, and one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
