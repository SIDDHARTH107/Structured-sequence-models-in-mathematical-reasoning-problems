    "message_1": "Suppose a seller has two types of cars - high-quality and low-quality - and the buyer values the high-quality car at $10,000 and the low-quality car at $5,000. However, the seller knows the condition of the cars and the buyer does not. The seller lists both cars at the same price and the buyer chooses one car without knowing which one it is. If the buyer gets the high-quality car, they receive a surplus of $5,000, and if they get the low-quality car, they receive a surplus of $0. However, the seller incurs a cost of $6,000 for the high-quality car and $3,000 for the low-quality car. What price should the seller set to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the price the seller sets as P. The seller's profit for each car type will be:\n\nProfit_HighQuality = P - $6,000\nProfit_LowQuality = P - $3,000\n\nSince the buyer doesn't know which car they are choosing, they will only be willing to pay a price that reflects the average value of the two cars. The average value of the cars to the buyer is:\n\nAverage_Value = ($10,000 + $5,000) / 2 = $7,500\n\nThe buyer will not be willing to pay more than $7,500, so the seller should set the price at P = $7,500 to maximize their profit.\n\nNow, let's calculate the seller's profit for each car type at this price:\n\nProfit_HighQuality = $7,500 - $6,000 = $1,500\nProfit_LowQuality = $7,500 - $3,000 = $4,500\n\nThe seller's expected profit, assuming they have an equal number of high-quality and low-quality cars, will be:\n\nExpected_Profit = (Profit_HighQuality + Profit_LowQuality) / 2\nExpected_Profit = ($1,500 + $4,500) / 2 = $3,000\n\nSo, the seller should set the price at $7,500 to maximize their expected profit of $3,000 per car."
