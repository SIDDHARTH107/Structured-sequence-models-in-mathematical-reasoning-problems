    "message_2": "First, let's observe that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n2(3x - 2y) = 2(4)\n6x - 4y = 8\n\nSince the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation, these two equations are dependent and represent the same line. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions for x and y that satisfy this system of linear equations.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve for y in terms of x (or vice versa) using the first equation:\n\n3x - 2y = 4\n\nFirst, isolate y:\n\n-2y = -3x + 4\n\nNow, divide by -2:\n\ny = (3/2)x - 2\n\nThis equation represents all the possible solutions for x and y. For any value of x, you can find the corresponding value of y that satisfies the system of linear equations."
