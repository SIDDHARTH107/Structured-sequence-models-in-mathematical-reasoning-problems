    "message_2": "There are 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32. However, the problem statement asks to prove that any group of order 32 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C32, the dihedral group D16, or one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32. This statement is incorrect, as there are more than these nine groups of order 32.\n\nTo identify the groups, we can use the following notation:\n\n1. C32: The cyclic group of order 32.\n2. C16 x C2: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 16 and the cyclic group of order 2.\n3. C8 x C4: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 4.\n4. C8 x C2 x C2: The direct product of the cyclic group of order 8 and two cyclic groups of order 2.\n5. C4 x C4 x C2: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n6. C4 x C2 x C2 x C2: The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and three cyclic groups of order 2.\n7. D16: The dihedral group of order 32 (2 * 16).\n8-51. Various non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nThe proof that any group of order 32 is isomorphic to one of these 51 groups is beyond the scope of this answer. However, it is important to note that the problem statement is incorrect, as there are more than nine non-isomorphic groups of order 32."
