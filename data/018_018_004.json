    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection of set A and set B:\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the union of set A and set B:\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference of set A and set B:\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of set B and set A to verify that the symmetric difference is commutative:\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10}\n\nAs we can see, A Δ B = B Δ A = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10}, which confirms that the symmetric difference is commutative."
