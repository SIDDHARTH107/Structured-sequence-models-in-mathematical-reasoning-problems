    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: Product A that sells for $5 per unit and Product B that sells for $7 per unit. The factory has a limited production capacity of 100 units per day. The production of Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time, while the production of Product B requires 1 hour of labor and 4 hours of machine time. Each day the factory has at most 360 labor hours available and 400 machine hours available. What is the maximum profit that the factory can make per day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B produced per day. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 7y, subject to the constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 100 (production capacity constraint)\n2. 2x + y ≤ 360 (labor hours constraint)\n3. 3x + 4y ≤ 400 (machine hours constraint)\n4. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method by plotting the feasible region and finding the vertices.\n\nFirst, we'll rewrite the constraints as follows:\n\n1. y ≤ 100 - x\n2. y ≤ 360 - 2x\n3. y ≤ (400 - 3x) / 4\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of constraint 1 and 2: (100 - x) = (360 - 2x) => x = 260/3, y = 100 - 260/3 = 40/3. Vertex: (260/3, 40/3)\n2. Intersection of constraint 1 and 3: (100 - x) = (400 - 3x) / 4 => x = 80, y = 100 - 80 = 20. Vertex: (80, 20)\n3. Intersection of constraint 2 and 3: (360 - 2x) = (400 - 3x) / 4 => x = 40, y = 360 - 2(40) = 280. Vertex: (40, 280) (This vertex is not in the feasible region since it violates constraint 1)\n4. x = 0, y = 0. Vertex: (0, 0)\n5. x = 100, y = 0. Vertex: (100, 0)\n6. x = 0, y = 100. Vertex: (0, 100) (This vertex is not in the feasible region since it violates constraint 2)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each feasible vertex:\n\n1. P(260/3, 40/3) = 5(260/3) + 7(40/3) = 1300 + 280 = 1580\n2. P(80, 20) = 5(80) + 7(20) = 400 + 140 = 540\n3. P(0, 0) = 0\n4. P(100, 0) = 5(100) = 500\n\nThe maximum profit is $1580 per day, which occurs when the factory produces 260/3 units of Product A and 40/3 units of Product B."
