    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The production process of each product requires the use of two types of resources, labor and materials, and each unit of product A requires 3 hours of labor and 4 pounds of material, while each unit of product B requires 5 hours of labor and 2 pounds of material. The company has 240 hours of labor and 200 pounds of material available for production. Each unit of product A generates a profit of $10, while each unit of product B generates a profit of $8. \n\nWhat should be the number of units produced for each product to maximize the company's profit? What is the maximum profit that can be obtained?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We have the following constraints:\n\nLabor: 3x + 5y ≤ 240\nMaterials: 4x + 2y ≤ 200\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 8y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraint inequalities:\n\n1) 3x + 5y ≤ 240\nWe can rewrite this inequality as y ≥ (240 - 3x) / 5\n\n2) 4x + 2y ≤ 200\nWe can rewrite this inequality as y ≤ (200 - 4x) / 2\n\nNow we need to find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1) Intersection of the two lines: (240 - 3x) / 5 = (200 - 4x) / 2\nSolving for x, we get x = 20. Substituting x back into either equation, we get y = 36.\n\n2) When x = 0, y = 48 (from the labor constraint)\n\n3) When y = 0, x = 50 (from the materials constraint)\n\nNow we evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1) P(20, 36) = 10(20) + 8(36) = 200 + 288 = $488\n2) P(0, 48) = 10(0) + 8(48) = $384\n3) P(50, 0) = 10(50) + 8(0) = $500\n\nThe maximum profit is $500, which occurs when the company produces 50 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
