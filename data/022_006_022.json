    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of $|z - 1|$ in the region defined by $|z| \\leq 2$, we can use geometric interpretation. Here, $z$ is a complex number, and we can represent it as $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe inequality $|z| \\leq 2$ represents all the points in the complex plane that are at a distance less than or equal to 2 from the origin. This is a closed disk centered at the origin with a radius of 2.\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum and minimum values of $|z - 1|$. Geometrically, this represents the distance between the point $z$ and the point $1$ (which is the complex number $1 + 0i$) in the complex plane.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $|z - 1|$, we need to find the point in the disk that is closest to the point $1$. This point is on the boundary of the disk and lies on the line segment connecting the origin and the point $1$. The point is $z = 1/2$, and the minimum value of $|z - 1|$ is $|1/2 - 1| = 1/2$.\n\nTo find the maximum value of $|z - 1|$, we need to find the point in the disk that is farthest from the point $1$. This point is on the boundary of the disk and is diametrically opposite to the point $1$ with respect to the origin. The point is $z = -1$, and the maximum value of $|z - 1|$ is $|-1 - 1| = 2$.\n\nSo, the minimum value of $|z - 1|$ is $1/2$, and the maximum value is $2$."
