    "message_2": "To find the complex solutions to the given quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 6, and c = 13. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (-6 ± √(6² - 4 * 1 * 13)) / 2 * 1\n\nz = (-6 ± √(36 - 52)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (36 - 52) is negative, we will have complex solutions. The discriminant is -16, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nz = (-6 ± √(-16)) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the square root of -16 as 4i (since √(-1) = i and √16 = 4). So, the equation becomes:\n\nz = (-6 ± 4i) / 2\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the numerator:\n\nz = (-3 ± 2i)\n\nSo, the complex solutions to the equation z^2 + 6z + 13 = 0 are:\n\nz = -3 + 2i and z = -3 - 2i"
