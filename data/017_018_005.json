    "message_2": "To represent a group of order 32, we can use the following groups:\n\n1. Cyclic group C32: This group has order 32 and is generated by a single element, say g, with g^32 = e (identity element). It has a unique structure since it is the only group of order 32 that is cyclic.\n\n2. Dihedral group D16: This group has order 32 and is generated by two elements, say r and s, with r^16 = s^2 = e and srs = r^(-1). It is unique up to isomorphism since it is the only group of order 32 that has a presentation with these relations.\n\n3. Non-abelian groups of order 32: There are six non-abelian groups of order 32, which can be represented by the following presentations:\n\na) G1 = <a, b | a^16 = b^2 = e, b^(-1)ab = a^9>\nb) G2 = <a, b | a^16 = b^4 = e, b^(-1)ab = a^9>\nc) G3 = <a, b | a^16 = b^4 = e, b^(-1)ab = a^5>\nd) G4 = <a, b | a^8 = b^4 = e, b^(-1)ab = a^5>\ne) G5 = <a, b | a^16 = b^4 = e, b^(-1)ab = a^3>\nf) G6 = <a, b | a^8 = b^4 = e, b^(-1)ab = a^3>\n\nThese groups are unique up to isomorphism since they have different presentations with distinct relations between their generators. To show that they are non-isomorphic, we can analyze their properties:\n\n- G1 and G2 have different orders for the element b (2 and 4, respectively), so they cannot be isomorphic.\n- G2 and G3 have the same order for b, but the relation b^(-1)ab is different (a^9 and a^5, respectively), so they cannot be isomorphic.\n- G3 and G4 have different orders for the element a (16 and 8, respectively), so they cannot be isomorphic.\n- G4 and G5 have the same order for both a and b, but the relation b^(-1)ab is different (a^5 and a^3, respectively), so they cannot be isomorphic.\n- G5 and G6 have the same relation b^(-1)ab, but different orders for the element a (16 and 8, respectively), so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\nThus, we have found all possible ways to represent a group of order 32 using one of the given groups, and we have shown that each representation is unique up to isomorphism."
