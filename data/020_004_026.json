    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The company has a production capacity of 500 units per day with a labor force of 50 workers. Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time, while product B requires 5 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time. The profit margin of product A is $20 per unit and that of B is $30 per unit. If the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of each product should it produce per day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: 2x + 5y ≤ 50 * 8 (since there are 50 workers and each works 8 hours a day)\n2. Machine time constraint: 3x + 2y ≤ 500 (since the production capacity is 500 units per day)\n3. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function: P(x, y) = 20x + 30y\n\nNow, we will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 5y ≤ 400 (divide both sides by 8)\n   y ≤ (400 - 2x) / 5\n\n2. 3x + 2y ≤ 500\n   y ≤ (500 - 3x) / 2\n\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of all these constraints. The corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 80), (100, 60), and (166.67, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 80) = 20(0) + 30(80) = $2400\n3. P(100, 60) = 20(100) + 30(60) = $2000 + $1800 = $3800\n4. P(166.67, 0) = 20(166.67) + 30(0) = $3333.40 (approx.)\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (100, 60), where the company should produce 100 units of product A and 60 units of product B per day. The maximum profit will be $3800 per day."
