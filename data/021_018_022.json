    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the best solution in a large solution space. In this case, we will use the tabu search algorithm to find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 11x^2 + 17x + 9 within the domain [-1, 4]. \n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing the tabu search algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the solution space: In this case, the solution space is the domain [-1, 4]. We can discretize this domain into small intervals, e.g., intervals of 0.1.\n\n2. Choose an initial solution: Randomly select a value of x within the domain, e.g., x = 1.\n\n3. Calculate the objective function value: Compute the value of f(x) for the initial solution.\n\n4. Initialize the tabu list: Create an empty list of size 5 to store the recent solutions.\n\n5. Start the iteration process: For each iteration, perform the following steps:\n\n  a. Generate neighboring solutions: Find the neighboring solutions of the current solution by adding or subtracting a small value, e.g., 0.1.\n\n  b. Evaluate the objective function for each neighboring solution.\n\n  c. Check if the neighboring solution is in the tabu list. If it is, discard it.\n\n  d. Choose the best neighboring solution that is not in the tabu list.\n\n  e. Update the tabu list: Add the chosen neighboring solution to the tabu list. If the tabu list is full, remove the oldest solution.\n\n  f. Update the current solution with the chosen neighboring solution.\n\n6. Repeat the iteration process until the maximum number of iterations (50) is reached.\n\n7. The best solution found during the iterations is the maximum value of the function within the domain.\n\nNote that the tabu search algorithm does not guarantee finding the global maximum, but it can provide a good approximation. In this case, the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 11x^2 + 17x + 9 within the domain [-1, 4] can be found using the tabu search algorithm with a tabu list of size 5 and a maximum of 50 iterations."
