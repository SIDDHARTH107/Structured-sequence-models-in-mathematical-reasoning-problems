    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using a Vigenere cipher with the key \"PI\", we first need to repeat the key to match the length of the message. The repeated key will be \"PIPIPIPIPIPI\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere cipher table to find the corresponding ciphertext for each letter in the message. The table is a 26x26 grid of letters, where the rows represent the plaintext letters and the columns represent the key letters. To find the ciphertext letter, we locate the intersection of the row corresponding to the plaintext letter and the column corresponding to the key letter.\n\nHere's the encryption process for each letter in the message:\n\nM (message) + P (key) = X (ciphertext)\nA + I = J\nT + P = C\nH + I = R\nE + P = O\nM + I = V\nA + P = Q\nT + I = Y\nI + P = R\nC + I = L\nS + P = X\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is \"XJCROVQYRLX\"."
