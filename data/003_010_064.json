    "message_1": "A tree casts a 12 meter long shadow. If the angle of elevation of the sun is 60 degrees, what is the height of the tree to the nearest meter?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the tree, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the tree (which we want to find), and the side adjacent to the angle is the length of the shadow (12 meters).\n\nThe formula for the tangent function is:\n\ntan(angle) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\n\nWe can plug in the values we know:\n\ntan(60) = (height of tree) / (12 meters)\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3 (approximately 1.732):\n\n1.732 = (height of tree) / (12 meters)\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the tree:\n\nheight of tree = 1.732 * 12 meters\nheight of tree â‰ˆ 20.784 meters\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the tree is approximately 21 meters."
