    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will first represent the given system as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  7 ]\n[ 2  1  1 | 10 ]\n[ 4  5 -3 | 18 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have the largest absolute value in the first column:\n\n```\n[ 2  1  1 | 10 ]\n[ 1  2 -1 |  7 ]\n[ 4  5 -3 | 18 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 3 with Row 3 - 2 * Row 1:\n\n```\n[ 2  1  1 | 10 ]\n[ 1  2 -1 |  7 ]\n[ 0  3 -5 | -2 ]\n```\n\n3. Replace Row 2 with Row 2 - 1/2 * Row 1:\n\n```\n[ 2  1  1 | 10 ]\n[ 0  3/2 -3/2 |  2 ]\n[ 0  3 -5 | -2 ]\n```\n\n4. Replace Row 3 with Row 3 - Row 2:\n\n```\n[ 2  1  1 | 10 ]\n[ 0  3/2 -3/2 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0 -1 | -4 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. From the third row, we have -z = -4, so z = 4.\n\n2. From the second row, we have 3/2 * y - 3/2 * z = 2. Plugging in the value of z, we get 3/2 * y - 3/2 * 4 = 2, so y = 2.\n\n3. From the first row, we have 2 * x + y + z = 10. Plugging in the values of y and z, we get 2 * x + 2 + 4 = 10, so x = 2.\n\nThus, the solutions are x = 2, y = 2, and z = 4."
