    "message_2": "To determine the possible structures of a group of order 36, we first note that 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures.\n\nLet G be a group of order 36. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we consider the following cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Both P_2 and P_3 are normal in G, and G is the direct product of P_2 and P_3. Since P_2 is isomorphic to either C2 × C2 or C4, and P_3 is isomorphic to C3 × C3 or C9, we have four possibilities for G: C2 × C2 × C3 × C3, C4 × C3 × C3, C2 × C2 × C9, and C4 × C9. However, C2 × C2 × C3 × C3 is isomorphic to C4 × C3 × C3, and C2 × C2 × C9 is isomorphic to C4 × C9. Thus, we have two non-isomorphic abelian groups in this case: C4 × C3 × C3 (or C36) and C4 × C9.\n\n2. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: In this case, G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 9. Since P_2 is normal in G, G has a semidirect product structure. There are two possibilities for P_2: C2 × C2 or C4. However, the only possibility for the action of G on P_2 is trivial, which leads to the direct product structure, and we have already considered this case in (1).\n\n3. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since P_3 is normal in G, G has a semidirect product structure. There are two possibilities for P_3: C3 × C3 or C9. If P_3 is isomorphic to C3 × C3, then G is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C3. If P_3 is isomorphic to C9, then there are two non-isomorphic semidirect products, which correspond to two non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: In this case, G has three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4 and four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 9. There is no normal subgroup in this case, so G cannot have a direct or semidirect product structure. However, there are seven non-isomorphic non-abelian groups of order 36 that can be constructed using generators and relations.\n\nIn summary, every group of order 36 is isomorphic to one of the following:\n\n- The cyclic group C36 (1 possibility)\n- The alternating group A4 × C3 (1 possibility)\n- One of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36 (9 possibilities)\n\nThus, there are 11 non-isomorphic groups of order 36."
