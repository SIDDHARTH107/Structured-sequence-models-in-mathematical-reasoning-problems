In this case, the student could begin by homogenizing the equation of the variety, then computing the partial derivatives and setting them to zero to obtain the critical points. Finally, the student would need to check which of these points are singular by examining the Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives.",
    "message_2": "First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable, w. The homogeneous equation for the Calabi-Yau variety in P^2 is:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyzw = 0\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and w:\n\n∂/∂x: 3x^2 - 3yzw = 0\n∂/∂y: 3y^2 - 3xzw = 0\n∂/∂z: 3z^2 - 3xyw = 0\n∂/∂w: -3xyz = 0\n\nSetting these partial derivatives to zero, we obtain the critical points:\n\n(1) 3x^2 = 3yzw\n(2) 3y^2 = 3xzw\n(3) 3z^2 = 3xyw\n(4) xyz = 0\n\nFrom equation (4), at least one of x, y, or z must be zero. We consider three cases:\n\nCase 1: x = 0\nFrom equation (2), either y = 0 or w = 0. If y = 0, then the point is [0:0:1], which is not in P^2. If w = 0, then from equation (3), either z = 0 or y = 0. If z = 0, the point is [0:1:0], and if y = 0, the point is [0:0:1]. Both points are in P^2.\n\nCase 2: y = 0\nFrom equation (1), either x = 0 or w = 0. If x = 0, then the point is [0:0:1], which is not in P^2. If w = 0, then from equation (3), either z = 0 or x = 0. If z = 0, the point is [1:0:0], and if x = 0, the point is [0:0:1]. Both points are in P^2.\n\nCase 3: z = 0\nFrom equation (1), either x = 0 or w = 0. If x = 0, then the point is [0:1:0], which is not in P^2. If w = 0, then from equation (2), either y = 0 or x = 0. If y = 0, the point is [1:0:0], and if x = 0, the point is [0:1:0]. Both points are in P^2.\n\nThus, the critical points are [1:0:0], [0:1:0], and [0:0:1]. To determine if these points are singular, we compute the Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives:\n\nH = | 6x  -3zw  -3yw |\n    | -3zw  6y  -3xw |\n    | -3yw -3xw  6z  |\n\nNow, we evaluate the Hessian matrix at each critical point:\n\nH([1:0:0]) = |  6  0  0 |\n             |  0  0 -3 |\n             |  0 -3  0 |\n\nH([0:1:0]) = |  0 -3  0 |\n             | -3  6  0 |\n             |  0  0 -3 |\n\nH([0:0:1]) = |  0  0 -3 |\n             |  0  0  0 |\n             | -3  0  6 |\n\nThe determinant of the Hessian matrix at each critical point is:\n\ndet(H([1:0:0])) = 0\ndet(H([0:1:0])) = 0\ndet(H([0:0:1])) = 0\n\nSince the determinant of the Hessian matrix is zero at each critical point, all three points are singular. Therefore, the singular points of the Calabi-Yau variety defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0 in the projective space P^2 are [1:0:0], [0:1:0], and [0:0:1]."
