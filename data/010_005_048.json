    "message_2": "To determine whether X is connected and path-connected, we need to understand the definitions of connectedness and path-connectedness in the context of topology.\n\nConnectedness: A topological space X is said to be connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets.\n\nPath-connectedness: A topological space X is said to be path-connected if for every pair of points x, y ∈ X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nNow let's analyze the given set X = [1, 5] ⊂ R with the subspace topology inherited from R.\n\nConnectedness:\nSince X is a subset of R, we can use the properties of real numbers to determine its connectedness. The set X is an interval in R, and it is a well-known fact that intervals in R are connected. Therefore, X is connected.\n\nPath-connectedness:\nTo show that X is path-connected, we need to find a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X for any two points x, y ∈ X. Let x, y ∈ X. Define the function f: [0, 1] → X as follows:\n\nf(t) = (1 - t)x + ty\n\nIt is easy to see that f is continuous, as it is a linear function. Moreover, f(0) = x and f(1) = y, as required. Thus, X is path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the set X = [1, 5] ⊂ R with the subspace topology inherited from R is both connected and path-connected."
