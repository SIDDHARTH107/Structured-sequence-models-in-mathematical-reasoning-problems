    "message_1": "Suppose you are a seller of used cars and you know that seventy percent of your cars are of high quality and thirty percent are of low quality. The buyers donâ€™t know the quality of the cars but they have to bid for them without knowing their quality. If the buyer values a high-quality car at $10,000 and a low-quality car at $5,000, what would be the expected revenue for the seller if the buyers bid an average of $8,000?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected revenue for the seller, we need to consider the probabilities of selling a high-quality car and a low-quality car, as well as the average bid price.\n\nThe probability of selling a high-quality car is 70%, and the probability of selling a low-quality car is 30%. The buyers bid an average of $8,000 for a car, regardless of its quality.\n\nExpected revenue for selling a high-quality car = (probability of selling a high-quality car) * (average bid price)\n= 0.70 * $8,000\n= $5,600\n\nExpected revenue for selling a low-quality car = (probability of selling a low-quality car) * (average bid price)\n= 0.30 * $8,000\n= $2,400\n\nTotal expected revenue for the seller = expected revenue for selling a high-quality car + expected revenue for selling a low-quality car\n= $5,600 + $2,400\n= $8,000"
