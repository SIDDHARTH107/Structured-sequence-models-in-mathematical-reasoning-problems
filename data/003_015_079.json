After 30 seconds, they are at a height of 25 meters. What is the amplitude and period of the person's height function on the Ferris wheel?",
    "message_2": "To find the amplitude and period of the person's height function on the Ferris wheel, we can model the height as a sinusoidal function. The general form of a sinusoidal function is:\n\nh(t) = A * sin(B(t - C)) + D\n\nwhere h(t) is the height at time t, A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nThe diameter of the Ferris wheel is 50 meters, so the radius is 25 meters. This means that the amplitude (A) is equal to the radius, which is 25 meters.\n\nThe Ferris wheel makes a full revolution in 80 seconds, so the period (T) is 80 seconds. The frequency (B) can be found using the formula:\n\nB = 2π / T\n\nSubstituting the given period:\n\nB = 2π / 80 = π / 40\n\nSince the person gets on the Ferris wheel at its lowest point, there is no phase shift (C = 0).\n\nThe vertical shift (D) is equal to the radius of the Ferris wheel, which is 25 meters. This is because the height function oscillates around the midpoint of the Ferris wheel's height.\n\nNow we have all the parameters for the height function:\n\nh(t) = 25 * sin(π/40 * t) + 25\n\nThe amplitude of the person's height function is 25 meters, and the period is 80 seconds."
