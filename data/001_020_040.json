    "message_2": "To solve the equation |2x + 5| = 11, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 2x + 5 = 11\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n2x = 6\nNow, divide by 2:\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: -(2x + 5) = 11\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n2x + 5 = -11\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n2x = -16\nNow, divide by 2:\nx = -8\n\nSo, the values of x that satisfy the equation |2x + 5| = 11 are x = 3 and x = -8."
