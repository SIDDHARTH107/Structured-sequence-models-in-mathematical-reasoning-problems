    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 32, and let n be the number of elements of order 2 in G. We are given that n = 16. We will use the properties of p-groups and the Sylow theorems to prove that G is isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nSince G is a group of order 32 = 2^5, it is a p-group with p = 2. By the properties of p-groups, the center Z(G) of G is nontrivial. Let |Z(G)| = 2^k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 5.\n\nNow, consider the factor group G/Z(G). The order of G/Z(G) is 2^(5-k). Since G/Z(G) is also a p-group, it has a nontrivial center. Thus, there exists an element x in G such that x is not in Z(G) and x^2 is in Z(G). Since x is not in Z(G), the order of x cannot be 1, and since x^2 is in Z(G), the order of x must be 2. This means that x is one of the 16 elements of order 2 in G.\n\nNow, let H be the subgroup of G generated by x. Since x has order 2, |H| = 2. Moreover, H is normal in G, as it is a subgroup of the center of G. Let K be a subgroup of G such that G = HK and |K| = 2^(4-k). Then, G is an extension of H by K, and |K| = 2^(4-k).\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, there are 2^(2k-1) Sylow 2-subgroups of G. Since there are 16 elements of order 2 in G, there are 2^(2k-1) - 1 = 16 elements of order 2 in K. Solving for k, we get k = 3. Therefore, |Z(G)| = 2^3 = 8, and |K| = 2^(4-3) = 2.\n\nNow, we have G = HK, where H is a normal subgroup of order 2 and K is a subgroup of order 16. Since |H| = 2 and |K| = 16, the group G is a semidirect product of H and K. There are six possible non-abelian semidirect products of groups of order 2 and 16, which correspond to the six non-abelian groups of order 32.\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to one of the six non-abelian groups of order 32."
