It would be more appropriate to provide a question related to propositional logic or predicate logic in mathematics. Let me know if you would like me to suggest a question on these topics.",
    "message_2": "I understand. Here's a question related to propositional logic:\n\nGiven the following propositions:\n\np: It is raining.\nq: I will take an umbrella.\n\nTranslate the following statement into a logical expression:\n\n\"If it is raining, then I will take an umbrella.\"\n\nPlease provide the logical expression using the symbols for the propositions and logical connectives."
