The sets of strategies available to each company are as follows:\n- Company A can choose a production level of 100 or 150 units\n- Company B can choose a production level of 100, 120, or 160 units\n- Company C can choose a production level of 80 or 120 units\n\nAssume that the demand function for this product is P(Q) = 500 - Q, where Q is the total production level and P is the price per unit. Assuming that Company A is the leader and Companies B and C are the followers, what should Company A's production level be in order to maximize its profits? What are the total production levels and prices per unit for all three companies under this scenario?",
