    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of the torus X, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The torus can be obtained by identifying the opposite sides of a square. Let's consider two open sets U and V, where U is the torus with a small disk removed from its interior, and V is an open disk around the removed disk. Their intersection U ∩ V is an annulus.\n\nThe fundamental group of U is the same as the fundamental group of a punctured plane, which is the free group on two generators, say a and b. The fundamental group of V is trivial, as it is contractible. The fundamental group of U ∩ V is the free group on one generator, say c, as it is homotopy equivalent to a circle.\n\nNow, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of X is the free product of the fundamental groups of U and V, modulo the normal subgroup generated by the relations between the generators in U ∩ V. In this case, the only relation is that c is homotopic to the loop a * b * a^(-1) * b^(-1) in U. Therefore, the fundamental group of X is the group generated by a and b, subject to the relation aba^(-1)b^(-1) = 1. This is the presentation of the fundamental group of the torus, which is isomorphic to Z × Z.\n\nNow, let's show that Y, the circle, is a covering space of X. A covering space is a space that locally looks like the base space, and the projection map is a local homeomorphism. We can construct a covering map p: Y × Y → X as follows: map each point (m, n) in Y × Y to the point in X obtained by going around the first hole of the torus m times and around the second hole n times. This map is continuous and surjective.\n\nTo show that p is a local homeomorphism, we need to show that for each point x in X, there exists an open neighborhood U of x such that p^(-1)(U) is a disjoint union of open sets in Y × Y, each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto U by p. We can choose U to be a small open disk around x that does not intersect the identified edges of the torus. Then p^(-1)(U) is a collection of disjoint open sets in Y × Y, each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto U by p. Thus, p is a local homeomorphism, and Y × Y is a covering space of X.\n\nHowever, we were asked to show that Y is a covering space of X. To do this, we can consider the projection map p': Y → X that wraps the circle Y around one of the holes of the torus, say the first one. This map is continuous and surjective. For each point x in X, we can choose a small open disk U around x that does not intersect the identified edges of the torus. Then p'^(-1)(U) is a collection of disjoint open sets in Y, each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto U by p'. Thus, p' is a local homeomorphism, and Y is a covering space of X."
