    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we will check each possible value of $x$ in the field and count the number of corresponding $y$ values that satisfy the curve equation.\n\nThe finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$ has elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We will plug each of these values into the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2$ and check for valid $y$ values.\n\n1. For $x = 0$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 2$. There are no solutions for $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n2. For $x = 1$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 1^3 + 2(1) + 2 = 5$. The solutions for $y$ are 3 and 4.\n3. For $x = 2$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 2^3 + 2(2) + 2 = 2$. There are no solutions for $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n4. For $x = 3$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 3^3 + 2(3) + 2 = 6$. The solutions for $y$ are 1 and 6.\n5. For $x = 4$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 4^3 + 2(4) + 2 = 6$. The solutions for $y$ are 1 and 6.\n6. For $x = 5$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 5^3 + 2(5) + 2 = 5$. The solutions for $y$ are 3 and 4.\n7. For $x = 6$, the equation becomes $y^2 = 6^3 + 2(6) + 2 = 2$. There are no solutions for $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\nWe found 8 solutions for $(x, y)$ pairs in the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$. Including the point at infinity, there are a total of 9 points on the elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{F}_7$."
