    "message_2": "First, let's find A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no common elements between A and B, so A ∩ B = {} (the empty set).\n\nNow, let's find (A ∩ B) x A. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set. Since A ∩ B is the empty set, there are no elements to form ordered pairs with elements from A. Therefore, (A ∩ B) x A = {} (the empty set).\n\nNext, let's find A x B. The Cartesian product of A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. In this case, A x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}.\n\nNow, let's find A x A. The Cartesian product of A with itself is the set of all ordered pairs (a, a') where a and a' are elements of A. In this case, A x A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}.\n\nFinally, let's find (A x B) ∩ (A x A). The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets. In this case, there are no common ordered pairs between A x B and A x A, so (A x B) ∩ (A x A) = {} (the empty set).\n\nIn conclusion, (A ∩ B) x A = {} and (A x B) ∩ (A x A) = {}."
