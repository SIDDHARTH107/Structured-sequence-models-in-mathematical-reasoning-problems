    "message_1": "Suppose a principal hires an agent to carry out a project. If the project is successful, the principal will earn $10,000 in profits. The agent has two options: to exert high effort or low effort. If the agent exerts high effort, there is a 70% chance the project will succeed, and if the agent exerts low effort, there is only a 30% chance of success. If the agent exerts high effort, their cost is $3,000, while if they exert low effort, their cost is only $1,000. How much should the principal pay the agent in order to incentivize them to exert high effort and maximize their profits?",
    "message_2": "To incentivize the agent to exert high effort, the principal needs to ensure that the agent's expected payoff from exerting high effort is greater than the expected payoff from exerting low effort.\n\nLet P_high be the payment the principal gives the agent if they exert high effort and the project is successful, and P_low be the payment if they exert low effort and the project is successful.\n\nThe agent's expected payoff from exerting high effort is:\nE_high = 0.7 * (P_high - $3,000)\n\nThe agent's expected payoff from exerting low effort is:\nE_low = 0.3 * (P_low - $1,000)\n\nTo incentivize high effort, we need E_high > E_low. We can assume that the principal will not pay the agent more for low effort than for high effort (P_low â‰¤ P_high).\n\nLet's consider the case where P_low = P_high. In this case, the agent would have no incentive to exert high effort, as their expected payoff would be the same for both efforts. Therefore, we need P_high > P_low.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum P_high that would make E_high > E_low:\n\n0.7 * (P_high - $3,000) > 0.3 * (P_high - $1,000)\n\n0.7 * P_high - $2,100 > 0.3 * P_high - $300\n\n0.4 * P_high > $1,800\n\nP_high > $4,500\n\nSo, the principal should pay the agent at least $4,500 if they exert high effort and the project is successful. This will ensure that the agent's expected payoff from exerting high effort is greater than the expected payoff from exerting low effort, incentivizing them to exert high effort and maximize the principal's profits."
