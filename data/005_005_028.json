    "message_1": "Suppose the weight of apples in a grocery store follows a normal distribution with a mean of 150 grams and a standard deviation of 20 grams. What is the probability that a randomly selected apple will weigh between 135 grams and 165 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected apple will weigh between 135 grams and 165 grams, we need to calculate the z-scores for both weights and then find the area under the normal distribution curve between those z-scores.\n\nFirst, let's find the z-scores for 135 grams and 165 grams:\n\nz1 = (135 - 150) / 20 = -15 / 20 = -0.75\nz2 = (165 - 150) / 20 = 15 / 20 = 0.75\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the normal distribution curve between z1 and z2. We can use a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) to find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores.\n\nP(z1) = P(-0.75) ≈ 0.2266\nP(z2) = P(0.75) ≈ 0.7734\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected apple will weigh between 135 grams and 165 grams is the area between z1 and z2, which can be calculated as:\n\nP(135 < weight < 165) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.7734 - 0.2266 = 0.5468\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected apple will weigh between 135 grams and 165 grams is approximately 54.68%."
