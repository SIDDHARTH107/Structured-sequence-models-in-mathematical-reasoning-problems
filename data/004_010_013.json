    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x - 2, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives. The power rule states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant and C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor the given function, we have three terms: 3x^2, 5x, and -2. We will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\n1. Antiderivative of 3x^2:\nUsing the power rule, n = 2, so the antiderivative is (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = x^3.\n\n2. Antiderivative of 5x:\nUsing the power rule, n = 1, so the antiderivative is (5x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (5x^2)/2.\n\n3. Antiderivative of -2:\nSince -2 is a constant, its antiderivative is -2x.\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of the three terms and add the constant of integration, C:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 + (5x^2)/2 - 2x + C"
