    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 7, so a connected graph must have at least 7-1 = 6 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 8 edges, which is more than the minimum required number of edges (6), it is possible for the graph to be connected. However, having more than the minimum number of edges does not guarantee that the graph is connected.\n\nTo definitively determine whether the graph is connected or not, we would need more information about the specific arrangement of the vertices and edges."
