    "message_1": "A 50-foot tall flagpole is situated on top of a building. From a point on the ground 60 feet away from the building, the angle of elevation to the top of the flagpole is 53°. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. We have the angle of elevation (53°) and the distance from the point on the ground to the building (60 feet). We want to find the height of the building (h) plus the height of the flagpole (50 feet).\n\nLet's consider the right triangle formed by the height of the building, the distance from the point on the ground to the building, and the line connecting the point on the ground to the top of the flagpole. The angle of elevation (53°) is the angle between the ground and the line connecting the point on the ground to the top of the flagpole.\n\nWe can use the tangent function, which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (distance from the building):\n\ntan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\n\nIn our case:\n\ntan(53°) = (h + 50) / 60\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh + 50 = 60 * tan(53°)\n\nh = 60 * tan(53°) - 50\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nh ≈ 60 * 1.333 - 50\nh ≈ 80 - 50\nh ≈ 30\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 30 feet."
