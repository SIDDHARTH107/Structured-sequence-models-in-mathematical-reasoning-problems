    "message_2": "To find the probability of two independent events both occurring, you can multiply the probabilities of each event. In this case, the probability of rain on Saturday is 70% (0.7) and the probability of rain on Sunday is 60% (0.6).\n\nSo, the probability of it raining on both days is:\n\n0.7 (Saturday) * 0.6 (Sunday) = 0.42\n\nTherefore, there is a 42% chance that it will rain on both days."
