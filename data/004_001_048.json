    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2, we will apply the power rule for each term. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n*x^(n-1).\n\nFor the first term, 3x^2:\nn = 2, so the derivative is (2)*(3x^(2-1)) = 6x.\n\nFor the second term, -5x:\nn = 1, so the derivative is (1)*(-5x^(1-1)) = -5.\n\nThe third term, 2, is a constant, so its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, we add the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 5 + 0 = 6x - 5."
