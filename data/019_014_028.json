    "message_2": "To evaluate the given expression using higher-order logic, we need to determine if the statement is true or false.\n\nStatement: ∀x ∃y (x + y > 10), where x and y are natural numbers.\n\nThis statement reads: \"For all natural numbers x, there exists a natural number y such that the sum of x and y is greater than 10.\"\n\nLet's analyze this statement:\n\n1. If x = 1, we can find a natural number y = 10, such that 1 + 10 > 10.\n2. If x = 2, we can find a natural number y = 9, such that 2 + 9 > 10.\n3. If x = 3, we can find a natural number y = 8, such that 3 + 8 > 10.\n\nWe can continue this pattern for all natural numbers x. In general, we can always find a natural number y = (11 - x), such that x + y > 10.\n\nTherefore, the statement ∀x ∃y (x + y > 10) is true for all natural numbers x."
