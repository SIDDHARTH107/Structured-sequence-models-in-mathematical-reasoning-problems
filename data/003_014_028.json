    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the function y = 3sin(2x - π/4), we need to identify the values of A, B, and C in the general form of a sinusoidal function: y = A*sin(Bx - C).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = 3\nB = 2\nC = π/4\n\n1. Amplitude (A):\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of A, which represents the maximum value of the function from the midline. In this case, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\n2. Period (T):\nThe period is the length of one complete cycle of the sinusoidal function. It is calculated as T = 2π/B. In this case, the period is T = 2π/2 = π.\n\n3. Phase Shift (Φ):\nThe phase shift is the horizontal shift of the function from its standard position. It is calculated as Φ = C/B. In this case, the phase shift is Φ = (π/4)/2 = π/8. Since the phase shift is positive, the function is shifted to the right by π/8 units.\n\nSo, the amplitude is 3, the period is π, and the phase shift is π/8 to the right."
