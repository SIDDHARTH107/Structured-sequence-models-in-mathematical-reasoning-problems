    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, and its zoom levels are not defined by a specific formula. However, we can describe the zoom levels in terms of magnification. Starting with a zoom level of 1, we can define the first five levels of zoom as follows:\n\n1. Zoom level 1: No zoom, the entire Mandelbrot set is visible.\n2. Zoom level 2: 2x magnification, the Mandelbrot set is twice as large.\n3. Zoom level 3: 4x magnification, the Mandelbrot set is four times as large.\n4. Zoom level 4: 8x magnification, the Mandelbrot set is eight times as large.\n5. Zoom level 5: 16x magnification, the Mandelbrot set is sixteen times as large.\n\nThese zoom levels are arbitrary and can be adjusted depending on the desired level of detail. The Mandelbrot set is infinitely complex, and as you zoom in, you will continue to discover new patterns and structures."
