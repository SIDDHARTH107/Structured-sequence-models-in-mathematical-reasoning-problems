    "message_1": "A math student needs to solve the following homogeneous system of linear equations:\n \nx + 2y - 3z = 0\n2x - y + 4z = 0\n3x + y - z = 0 \n\nThe task is to find the solution for the three unknown variables x, y, and z.",
    "message_2": "To solve this homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n| 1  2 -3 | 0\n| 2 -1  4 | 0\n| 3  1 -1 | 0\n\nNow, we perform the Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  2 -3 | 0\n| 0 -5 10 | 0\n| 0 -5  8 | 0\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -5:\n\n| 1  2 -3 | 0\n| 0  1 -2 | 0\n| 0 -5  8 | 0\n\nStep 3: Add 5 times the second row to the third row:\n\n| 1  2 -3 | 0\n| 0  1 -2 | 0\n| 0  0  2 | 0\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by 2:\n\n| 1  2 -3 | 0\n| 0  1 -2 | 0\n| 0  0  1 | 0\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 0.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y - 2z = y = 0.\n\nFrom the first row, we have x + 2y - 3z = x = 0.\n\nSo, the solution for the homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
