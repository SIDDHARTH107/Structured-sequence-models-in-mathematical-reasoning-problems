    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\n3x + 2y - z = 10\n\n6x + 4y - 2z = 20\n\n9x + 6y - 3z = 30\n\nIs the system solvable? If so, find the solution(s) for x, y, and z. If not, explain why.",
    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are linearly dependent, and they all represent the same plane in 3D space.\n\nSince all three equations represent the same plane, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of linear equations. To find the general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let's solve the first equation for z:\n\nz = 3x + 2y - 10\n\nNow, any (x, y, z) that satisfies this equation will be a solution to the system."
