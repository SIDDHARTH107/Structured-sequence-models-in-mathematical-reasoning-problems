    "message_1": "A block oscillates horizontally on a spring with an equation of motion given by the function y(t) = 10cos(4t - π/3) where y is the displacement from the equilibrium position in centimeters and t is the time in seconds. Find the period and amplitude of the block's motion.",
    "message_2": "The given equation of motion is y(t) = 10cos(4t - π/3). This is a cosine function of the form y(t) = A*cos(Bt - C), where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn this case, A = 10, which means the amplitude of the block's motion is 10 centimeters.\n\nThe angular frequency B is 4. To find the period T of the block's motion, we use the formula T = 2π/B. So, T = 2π/4 = π/2 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the block's motion is 10 centimeters, and the period is π/2 seconds."
