    "message_2": "To find the global minimum value of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 + 2x + 1 in the interval [-1, 2], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nLet's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 8x^3 + 6x^2 + 2x + 1)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0:\n\n12x^3 - 24x^2 + 12x + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and it may be difficult to solve it algebraically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the approximate values of x for which the derivative is zero. Using a numerical solver, we find that the approximate values of x are:\n\nx ≈ 0.213, x ≈ 1.287\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function f(x) at these critical points and the endpoints of the interval [-1, 2]:\n\nf(-1) = 3(-1)^4 - 8(-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 1 = 3 - 8 + 6 - 2 + 1 = 0\nf(0.213) ≈ 3(0.213)^4 - 8(0.213)^3 + 6(0.213)^2 + 2(0.213) + 1 ≈ 1.738\nf(1.287) ≈ 3(1.287)^4 - 8(1.287)^3 + 6(1.287)^2 + 2(1.287) + 1 ≈ 0.924\nf(2) = 3(2)^4 - 8(2)^3 + 6(2)^2 + 2(2) + 1 = 48 - 64 + 24 + 4 + 1 = 13\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the global minimum value of the function in the interval [-1, 2] is approximately 0.924, which occurs at x ≈ 1.287."
