    "message_2": "First, let's find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-2|x|). The Fourier transform of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(k) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx from -∞ to +∞\n\nFor f(x) = e^(-2|x|), we need to consider two cases: x ≥ 0 and x < 0.\n\nCase 1: x ≥ 0\nf(x) = e^(-2x)\nF1(k) = ∫[e^(-2x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx from 0 to +∞\n\nCase 2: x < 0\nf(x) = e^(2x)\nF2(k) = ∫[e^(2x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx from -∞ to 0\n\nNow, we can find the total Fourier transform F(k) by adding F1(k) and F2(k):\n\nF(k) = F1(k) + F2(k)\n\nF1(k) = ∫[e^(-2x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx from 0 to +∞\n= ∫[e^(-2x - 2πikx)] dx from 0 to +∞\n= [-1/(2 + 2πik)] * e^(-2x - 2πikx) | from 0 to +∞\n= [-1/(2 + 2πik)] * (0 - 1)\n= 1/(2 + 2πik)\n\nF2(k) = ∫[e^(2x) * e^(-2πikx)] dx from -∞ to 0\n= ∫[e^(2x - 2πikx)] dx from -∞ to 0\n= [1/(2 - 2πik)] * e^(2x - 2πikx) | from -∞ to 0\n= [1/(2 - 2πik)] * (1 - 0)\n= 1/(2 - 2πik)\n\nNow, we can find the total Fourier transform F(k):\n\nF(k) = F1(k) + F2(k)\n= 1/(2 + 2πik) + 1/(2 - 2πik)\n\nNow, let's solve the differential equation f''(x) + 4f(x) = 0 using the method of Fourier transforms. Taking the Fourier transform of both sides, we get:\n\n(-4π^2k^2 + 4)F(k) = 0\n\nSince F(k) ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by (-4π^2k^2 + 4):\n\nF(k) = 1/(2 + 2πik) + 1/(2 - 2πik)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform to get the solution f(x):\n\nf(x) = e^(-2|x|)\n\nThis is the solution to the differential equation f''(x) + 4f(x) = 0 with the boundary conditions f(-∞) = 0 and f(+∞) = 0."
