    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem for a student to solve in Linear logic:\n\nSuppose you have a set of linear formulas:\n- x + y = 5\n- 2x + 3y = 13\n\nUsing linear logic, determine if the following statement is true or false: \"If x = 2, then y = 3\".",
    "message_2": "To determine if the statement is true or false, we can substitute the given value of x into the linear formulas and solve for y.\n\n1. Substitute x = 2 into the first equation:\n2 + y = 5\n\n2. Solve for y:\ny = 5 - 2\ny = 3\n\nNow, let's check if this value of y satisfies the second equation:\n\n1. Substitute x = 2 and y = 3 into the second equation:\n2(2) + 3(3) = 13\n\n2. Check if the equation holds true:\n4 + 9 = 13\n13 = 13\n\nSince both equations are satisfied with x = 2 and y = 3, the statement \"If x = 2, then y = 3\" is true."
