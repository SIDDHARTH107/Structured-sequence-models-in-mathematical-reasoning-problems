    "message_2": "To compute the Euler characteristic χ(X, O_X), we can use the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem, which states that for a smooth projective variety X of dimension n and a coherent sheaf F on X, we have:\n\nχ(X, F) = ∫_X ch(F) * td(X),\n\nwhere ch(F) is the Chern character of F, and td(X) is the Todd class of X.\n\nIn our case, F = O_X, the structure sheaf of X. The Chern character of the structure sheaf is ch(O_X) = 1. Now we need to compute the Todd class of X.\n\nSince X is a Fano variety, its anticanonical bundle -K_X is ample. Let L be a line bundle on X such that L^n = d. Then -K_X = L, and the total Chern class of X is given by:\n\nc(X) = c(T_X) = c(-K_X) = c(L) = 1 + c_1(L) + ... + c_n(L),\n\nwhere c_i(L) are the Chern classes of L.\n\nNow we can compute the Todd class of X:\n\ntd(X) = (1 + c_1(X)/2 + c_2(X)/12 + ...)^n.\n\nSince ρ(X) = 1, the Picard group of X is generated by the class of L. Therefore, c_1(X) = c_1(L) = -c_1(K_X), and all higher Chern classes c_i(X) for i > 1 are zero.\n\nThus, the Todd class of X simplifies to:\n\ntd(X) = (1 - c_1(K_X)/2)^n.\n\nNow we can compute the Euler characteristic χ(X, O_X):\n\nχ(X, O_X) = ∫_X ch(O_X) * td(X) = ∫_X (1 - c_1(K_X)/2)^n.\n\nSince L^n = d, we have:\n\n∫_X c_1(K_X)^n = (-1)^n ∫_X c_1(L)^n = (-1)^n d.\n\nNow we can use the binomial theorem to expand (1 - c_1(K_X)/2)^n:\n\n(1 - c_1(K_X)/2)^n = ∑_{k=0}^n (-1)^k (n choose k) (c_1(K_X)/2)^k.\n\nIntegrating term by term, we get:\n\nχ(X, O_X) = ∑_{k=0}^n (-1)^k (n choose k) ∫_X (c_1(K_X)/2)^k.\n\nSince ∫_X c_1(K_X)^n = (-1)^n d, all other integrals with even k are zero. Therefore, we have:\n\nχ(X, O_X) = 1 - (n choose 2) ∫_X (c_1(K_X)/2)^2 + ... - (n choose n) ∫_X (c_1(K_X)/2)^n.\n\nNow we can substitute the values of the integrals:\n\nχ(X, O_X) = 1 - (n choose 2) 0 + ... - (n choose n) (-1)^n d/2^n.\n\nSince all terms with even k are zero, we get:\n\nχ(X, O_X) = 1 - (n choose n) (-1)^n d/2^n = 1 + (-1)^n d/2^n.\n\nThis is the Euler characteristic of X with respect to the structure sheaf."
