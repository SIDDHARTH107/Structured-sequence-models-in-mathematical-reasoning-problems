    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using Fourier series, we first assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = k T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by kXT:\n\n(1/kT)∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\n(1/kT)∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow, we solve these two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) separately:\n\nFor X(x):\n\n∂²X(x)/∂x² + λ²X(x) = 0\n\nwith boundary conditions X(0) = X(L) = 0.\n\nThis is an eigenvalue problem, and the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are given by:\n\nλ_n = nπ/L, X_n(x) = sin(nπx/L), n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nFor T(t):\n\n∂T(t)/∂t + kλ²T(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is given by:\n\nT_n(t) = exp(-kλ_n²t)\n\nNow, we can write the solution u(x, t) as a sum of the product of these eigenfunctions and time-dependent functions:\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[A_n sin(nπx/L) exp(-k(nπ/L)²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition u(x, 0) = f(x):\n\nf(x) = ∑[A_n sin(nπx/L)]\n\nSince f(x) = x(3L - x)/L³, we can find A_n by projecting f(x) onto the eigenfunctions:\n\nA_n = (2/L) ∫[f(x) sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nA_n = (2/L) ∫[x(3L - x)/L³ sin(nπx/L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nAfter integrating, we get:\n\nA_n = (6/n³π³)[1 - (-1)^n]\n\nNow, we can write the final solution for u(x, t):\n\nu(x, t) = ∑[(6/n³π³)[1 - (-1)^n] sin(nπx/L) exp(-k(nπ/L)²t)] for n = 1, 2, 3, ..."
