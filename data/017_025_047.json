    "message_2": "To find the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the powers of its prime divisors.\n2. The number of groups of a given order is determined by the number of partitions of the prime powers in the order.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1. Now, we will consider the partitions of the prime powers.\n\nFor 2^3, there are three partitions: (3), (2, 1), and (1, 1, 1).\nFor 3^1, there is only one partition: (1).\nFor 5^1, there is only one partition: (1).\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of the number of partitions for each prime power:\n\nNumber of groups = (number of partitions for 2^3) * (number of partitions for 3^1) * (number of partitions for 5^1)\nNumber of groups = 3 * 1 * 1\nNumber of groups = 3\n\nTherefore, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
