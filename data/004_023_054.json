    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the two curves y = x and y = x^2 - 1 in the interval [0, 1], we need to find the points of intersection between the two curves and then integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the points of intersection by setting the two functions equal to each other:\n\nx = x^2 - 1\nx^2 - x - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = -1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1))) / 2(1)\nx = (1 ± √(1 + 4)) / 2\nx = (1 ± √5) / 2\n\nSince we are only interested in the interval [0, 1], we can ignore the root (1 + √5) / 2, as it is greater than 1. So, the point of intersection within the interval [0, 1] is x = (1 - √5) / 2.\n\nNow, we need to integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, (1 - √5) / 2] and [(1 - √5) / 2, 1]:\n\nArea = ∫[0, (1 - √5) / 2] (x - (x^2 - 1)) dx + ∫[(1 - √5) / 2, 1] ((x^2 - 1) - x) dx\n\nLet's evaluate the first integral:\n\n∫[0, (1 - √5) / 2] (x - x^2 + 1) dx = [x^2/2 - x^3/3 + x] from 0 to (1 - √5) / 2\n\nNow, let's evaluate the second integral:\n\n∫[(1 - √5) / 2, 1] (x^2 - x + 1) dx = [x^3/3 - x^2/2 + x] from (1 - √5) / 2 to 1\n\nNow, we need to plug in the limits of integration and subtract:\n\nFirst integral:\n[((1 - √5) / 2)^2/2 - ((1 - √5) / 2)^3/3 + (1 - √5) / 2] - [0] = (3 + √5) / 12\n\nSecond integral:\n[1/3 - 1/2 + 1] - [((1 - √5) / 2)^3/3 - ((1 - √5) / 2)^2/2 + (1 - √5) / 2] = (5 - √5) / 12\n\nAdding the results of the two integrals:\n\nArea = (3 + √5) / 12 + (5 - √5) / 12 = (8 + √5 - √5) / 12 = 8 / 12 = 2 / 3\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the two curves y = x and y = x^2 - 1 in the interval [0, 1] is 2/3 square units."
