    "message_2": "First, let's consider the case where G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4. If G is isomorphic to C4, then there exists an element a in G such that the order of a is 4. This means that a^4 = e, a^3 ≠ e, a^2 ≠ e, and a ≠ e. Since G has order 4, the elements of G are {e, a, a^2, a^3}. Now, let's consider the element b in G such that b is not equal to a, b is not equal to e, and b^2 = e. Since b ≠ e and b ≠ a, b must be either a^2 or a^3.\n\nCase 1: b = a^2\nIn this case, b^2 = (a^2)^2 = a^4 = e, which satisfies the given condition. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C4 in this case.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4. The Klein four-group V4 is the group with elements {e, a, b, c} where a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e, and ab = c, bc = a, and ca = b. If G is isomorphic to V4, then there exists an element b in G such that b is not equal to a, b is not equal to e, and b^2 = e. \n\nSince a ≠ e and a^2 ≠ e, the order of a must be 2 (as the order of an element divides the order of the group). Therefore, a^2 = e. Now, let's consider the element b in G such that b is not equal to a, b is not equal to e, and b^2 = e. Since b ≠ e and b ≠ a, b must be a different element in G. Let's denote this element as c. Then, c^2 = e.\n\nNow, we have the elements e, a, b, and c in G, where a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. Since G has order 4, these are all the elements in G. Moreover, the product of any two distinct elements is the remaining element, as in V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4 in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, if there exists an element b in G such that b is not equal to a, b is not equal to e, and b^2 = e, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4. Otherwise, G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4."
