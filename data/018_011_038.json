    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of A and B, which is denoted as A ∩ B. The intersection of two sets is the set containing all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {2} (since 2 is the only element common to both A and B)\n\nNow, let's compute the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\n(A ∩ B) × B = {(2, 2), (2, 4)}\n\nNext, let's compute the Cartesian product of A and B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and B is distributive over the intersection of A and B. The distributive property states that A × (B ∩ C) = (A × B) ∩ (A × C). In our case, we want to show that (A ∩ B) × B = (A × B) ∩ ((A ∩ B) × B).\n\nSince (A ∩ B) × B = {(2, 2), (2, 4)}, let's find the intersection of (A × B) and ((A ∩ B) × B).\n\n(A × B) ∩ ((A ∩ B) × B) = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)} ∩ {(2, 2), (2, 4)} = {(2, 2), (2, 4)}\n\nAs we can see, (A ∩ B) × B = (A × B) ∩ ((A ∩ B) × B) = {(2, 2), (2, 4)}, which proves that the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and B is distributive over the intersection of A and B."
