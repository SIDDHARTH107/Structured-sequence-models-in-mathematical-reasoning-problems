    "message_1": "Assuming a stream cipher with a key length of 128 bits and a plaintext message of 2000 bits, how many unique keys are possible in the stream cipher?",
    "message_2": "A stream cipher with a key length of 128 bits means that there are 2^128 possible unique keys. This is because each bit can have 2 possible values (0 or 1), and there are 128 bits in the key. So, the total number of unique keys is:\n\n2^128 â‰ˆ 3.4 x 10^38\n\nTherefore, there are approximately 3.4 x 10^38 unique keys possible in the stream cipher."
