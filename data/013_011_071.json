    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem on Bertrand Competition for a math student to solve:\n\nIn a market, two firms A and B engage in Bertrand Competition, where they simultaneously set prices for their identical products. If the cost of producing one unit of the product is $10 and the market demand is q = 100 - p, where p is the price, what is the Nash equilibrium price and profit for each firm?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium price and profit for each firm, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms. The reaction function shows the best response of one firm to the price set by the other firm.\n\nLet pA be the price set by firm A and pB be the price set by firm B. The profit functions for both firms are:\n\nπA = (pA - 10) * qA\nπB = (pB - 10) * qB\n\nSince the market demand is q = 100 - p, we can write the demand for each firm as:\n\nqA = 100 - pA - pB\nqB = 100 - pA - pB\n\nNow, we can substitute the demand functions into the profit functions:\n\nπA = (pA - 10) * (100 - pA - pB)\nπB = (pB - 10) * (100 - pA - pB)\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to find the first-order conditions for each firm's profit function with respect to their own price:\n\n∂πA/∂pA = -2pA + pB + 90\n∂πB/∂pB = -2pB + pA + 90\n\nNow, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the Nash equilibrium prices:\n\nFrom ∂πA/∂pA = 0, we get pB = 2pA - 90\nSubstitute this into ∂πB/∂pB = 0:\n\n-2pB + (2pA - 90) + 90 = 0\n-2pB + 2pA = 0\npA = pB\n\nNow, substitute pA = pB back into pB = 2pA - 90:\n\npA = 2pA - 90\npA = 30\n\nSince pA = pB, we have pB = 30 as well. Thus, the Nash equilibrium price for both firms is $30.\n\nNow, we can find the Nash equilibrium profit for each firm:\n\nqA = 100 - pA - pB = 100 - 30 - 30 = 40\nqB = 100 - pA - pB = 100 - 30 - 30 = 40\n\nπA = (pA - 10) * qA = (30 - 10) * 40 = 20 * 40 = $800\nπB = (pB - 10) * qB = (30 - 10) * 40 = 20 * 40 = $800\n\nSo, the Nash equilibrium profit for each firm is $800."
