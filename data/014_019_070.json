    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the described transposition cipher, we first reverse the letters in each word and then reverse the words themselves. \n\n1. Reverse the letters in each word:\n   HELLO -> OLLEH\n   WORLD -> DLROW\n\n2. Reverse the words themselves:\n   OLLEH DLROW -> DLROW OLLEH\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is \"DLROW OLLEH\"."
