    "message_1": "Consider the complex manifold defined by $S^1 \\times S^1$, where $S^1$ denotes the unit circle in the complex plane. The Hodge numbers of this manifold are $h^{1,0}=h^{0,1}=h^{1,1}=1$. Find the dimension of the space of (1,1)-forms (i.e., forms of type $(1,1)$) on this manifold.",
    "message_2": "The Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}$ represent the dimensions of the spaces of $(p,q)$-forms on a complex manifold. In this case, we are given that $h^{1,1} = 1$. Therefore, the dimension of the space of (1,1)-forms on the complex manifold $S^1 \\times S^1$ is 1."
