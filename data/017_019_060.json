    "message_2": "To find the non-isomorphic groups of order 36, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. Let's find the Sylow p-subgroups for p = 2 and p = 3.\n\nFor p = 2, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3^2 = 9 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 9. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal. If n_2 = 9, there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nFor p = 3, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 2^2 = 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal. If n_3 = 4, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and none of them are normal.\n\nNow, we can consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If both n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Both are normal, and the group is a direct product of these subgroups, which gives us the abelian group Z_4 x Z_9.\n\n2. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then there is a unique normal Sylow 2-subgroup and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. The group is a semidirect product of the form Z_4 ⋊ Z_9. There are two possible actions of Z_9 on Z_4, which give us two non-isomorphic non-abelian groups.\n\n3. If n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1, then there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique normal Sylow 3-subgroup. The group is a semidirect product of the form Z_9 ⋊ Z_4. There is only one possible action of Z_4 on Z_9, which gives us one non-isomorphic non-abelian group.\n\n4. If both n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4, then there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. However, this case does not yield any new groups, as they are already covered by the previous cases.\n\nIn summary, there are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36:\n\n1. The abelian group Z_4 x Z_9.\n2. Two non-abelian groups of the form Z_4 ⋊ Z_9.\n3. One non-abelian group of the form Z_9 ⋊ Z_4.\n\nThus, there are three non-abelian groups of order 36, and their isomorphism classes are represented by the groups Z_4 ⋊ Z_9 and Z_9 ⋊ Z_4."
