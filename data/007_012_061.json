    "message_2": "Let's denote the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies the condition as n. We are given that n! ≡ p - 1 (mod p), where p is a prime number.\n\nWe know that for a prime number p, by Wilson's theorem, (p-1)! ≡ -1 (mod p), which means (p-1)! ≡ p - 1 (mod p).\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the condition is n = p - 1, where p is a prime number.\n\nThe smallest prime number is 2, but we need n to be greater than 1. The next smallest prime number is 3. So, let's take p = 3.\n\nNow, n = p - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies the given condition is n = 2."
