    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^2 - 4x + 4\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can try factoring:\n\n0 = (x - 2)(x - 2)\n\nSo, x - 2 = 0, which means x = 2. There is only one x-intercept, and it is at the point (2, 0).\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 0^2 - 4(0) + 4\n\ny = 4\n\nSo, the y-intercept is at the point (0, 4)."
