    "message_1": "A company wants to test 4 factors (A, B, C, D) that may affect the production of a new product. They plan to use an Orthogonal Array test plan to minimize the number of trials needed. How many trials (rows) are needed for an OA(4,3) test plan?",
    "message_2": "An OA(4,3) test plan means that there are 4 factors (A, B, C, D) and each factor has 3 levels. To determine the number of trials (rows) needed for this test plan, we can use the formula:\n\nOA(L^k, n) = L^k\n\nwhere L is the number of levels, k is the number of factors, and n is the number of trials.\n\nIn this case, L = 3 and k = 4, so the formula becomes:\n\nOA(3^4, n) = 3^4\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nn = 3^4 = 81\n\nSo, 81 trials (rows) are needed for an OA(4,3) test plan."
