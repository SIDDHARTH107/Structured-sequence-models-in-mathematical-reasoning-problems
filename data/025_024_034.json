    "message_1": "Let X be the affine variety defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 in the complex plane C^2, and let G be the multiplicative group of scalars {λ ∈ C : λ ≠ 0}. The action of G on X is given by (λ, (x, y)) → (λx, λy). Define a polynomial function f : X → C by f(x, y) = x^2 + 2y^2. \n\nWhat are the invariants of the action of G on X? In other words, what polynomials in the variables x and y are invariant under the action of G?",
    "message_2": "To find the invariants of the action of G on X, we need to find the polynomials P(x, y) such that P(λx, λy) = P(x, y) for all λ ∈ G and (x, y) ∈ X.\n\nLet P(x, y) be a polynomial invariant under the action of G. Then, for any λ ∈ G, we have:\n\nP(λx, λy) = P(x, y)\n\nNow, consider the action of G on the polynomial f(x, y) = x^2 + 2y^2. We have:\n\nf(λx, λy) = (λx)^2 + 2(λy)^2 = λ^2(x^2 + 2y^2) = λ^2f(x, y)\n\nSince λ ≠ 0, f(x, y) is not invariant under the action of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the equation defining the affine variety X: x^2 + y^2 = 1. This equation is homogeneous of degree 2, so if we raise both sides to the same power, we obtain an invariant polynomial. Let's raise both sides to the power of 2:\n\n(x^2 + y^2)^2 = 1^2\n\nx^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 = 1\n\nThis polynomial is invariant under the action of G, as we can verify:\n\nP(λx, λy) = (λ^4x^4) + 2(λ^2x^2)(λ^2y^2) + (λ^4y^4) = λ^4(x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4) = λ^4P(x, y)\n\nSince λ ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by λ^4, and we obtain P(x, y) = x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4.\n\nIn conclusion, the invariants of the action of G on X are the polynomials obtained by raising the equation defining X to an even power. In this case, the invariant polynomial is P(x, y) = x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4."
