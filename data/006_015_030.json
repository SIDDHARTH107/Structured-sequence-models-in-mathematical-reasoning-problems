    "message_2": "To find the probability that a network will experience a malware attack within a week, we can use the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, malware attacks) occurring within a fixed interval of time (one week).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k malware attacks in a week\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of malware attacks per week (2.5 in this case)\n- k is the number of malware attacks we want to find the probability for\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- ! denotes the factorial function\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least one malware attack, we can find the probability of zero malware attacks and subtract it from 1.\n\nFor k = 0:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-2.5) * 2.5^0) / 0! = (e^(-2.5) * 1) / 1 = e^(-2.5)\n\nNow, we find the probability of at least one malware attack:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-2.5) ≈ 0.918\n\nSo, the probability that a network will experience a malware attack within a week is approximately 0.918 or 91.8%."
