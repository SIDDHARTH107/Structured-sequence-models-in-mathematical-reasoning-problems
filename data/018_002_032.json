In this case, we need to show that all elements of A ∩ B are members of both A and B.\n\nLet's check each element of A ∩ B:\n\n1. 4 is an element of A ∩ B. It is also an element of A and an element of B.\n2. 8 is an element of A ∩ B. It is also an element of A and an element of B.\n\nSince all elements of A ∩ B are elements of both A and B, we can conclude that A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B."
