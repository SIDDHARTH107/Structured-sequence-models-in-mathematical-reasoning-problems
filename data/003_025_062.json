    "message_1": "A boat travels 20 km north and then 30 km east. What is the magnitude and direction of the displacement vector of the boat from its starting point? (Round the magnitude to the nearest tenth and the direction to the nearest degree.)",
    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the displacement vector, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry.\n\nLet's denote the northward displacement as A and the eastward displacement as B. A = 20 km and B = 30 km.\n\n1. Magnitude of the displacement vector:\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude (C) of the displacement vector: C^2 = A^2 + B^2\n\nC^2 = (20 km)^2 + (30 km)^2\nC^2 = 400 + 900\nC^2 = 1300\nC = √1300\nC ≈ 36.1 km (rounded to the nearest tenth)\n\n2. Direction of the displacement vector:\nWe can use the tangent function to find the angle (θ) between the displacement vector and the northward direction (A).\n\ntan(θ) = B / A\ntan(θ) = 30 km / 20 km\ntan(θ) = 1.5\n\nθ = arctan(1.5)\nθ ≈ 56.3° (rounded to the nearest degree)\n\nSo, the magnitude of the displacement vector is approximately 36.1 km, and the direction is approximately 56.3° east of north."
