    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the given function f(t) = (sin 3t) / (t^2 + 9), we'll use the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * f(t)) dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nIn our case, f(t) = (sin 3t) / (t^2 + 9). So, we need to find the Laplace transform of this function:\n\nF(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * (sin 3t) / (t^2 + 9)) dt, from 0 to ∞\n\nThis integral is not easy to solve directly. However, we can use the convolution theorem to simplify the problem. The convolution theorem states that:\n\nL{f(t) * g(t)} = F(s) * G(s)\n\nwhere f(t) * g(t) is the convolution of f(t) and g(t), and F(s) and G(s) are their respective Laplace transforms.\n\nIn our case, we can rewrite the given function as a product of two functions:\n\nf(t) = (sin 3t) * (1 / (t^2 + 9))\n\nNow, we can find the Laplace transforms of these two functions separately:\n\nL{sin 3t} = 3 / (s^2 + 3^2) = 3 / (s^2 + 9)\n\nL{1 / (t^2 + 9)} = 1 / √9 * atan(s / √9) = 1/3 * atan(s/3)\n\nNow, we can use the convolution theorem to find the Laplace transform of the product of these functions:\n\nF(s) = L{(sin 3t) / (t^2 + 9)} = L{(sin 3t) * (1 / (t^2 + 9))} = (3 / (s^2 + 9)) * (1/3 * atan(s/3))\n\nF(s) = (1 / (s^2 + 9)) * atan(s/3)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the given function f(t) = (sin 3t) / (t^2 + 9) is:\n\nF(s) = (1 / (s^2 + 9)) * atan(s/3)"
