    "message_2": "To find the angle whose tangent is 0.75, the student should use the inverse tangent function, also known as arctangent or tan^(-1). \n\nangle = tan^(-1)(0.75)\n\nNow, we need to convert the result from radians to degrees:\n\nangle (in degrees) = angle (in radians) * (180 / π)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nangle = tan^(-1)(0.75) ≈ 0.6435 radians\n\nangle (in degrees) = 0.6435 * (180 / π) ≈ 36.87 degrees\n\nSo, the angle the student should find is approximately 36.87 degrees."
