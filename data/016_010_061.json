    "message_2": "The Apollonian Gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the interstices between mutually tangent circles with new tangent circles. In this problem, we start with three mutually tangent circles with radii 2, 3, and 4.\n\nTo find the radius of the first circle that fills the interstice between the three starting circles, we can use Descartes' Circle Theorem, which states that for four mutually tangent circles with curvatures (k1, k2, k3, k4), the following equation holds:\n\nk1 + k2 + k3 + k4 = (k1 + k2 + k3 - k4)^2 / 2(k1k2 + k2k3 + k3k1)\n\nCurvature (k) is the reciprocal of the radius (r), i.e., k = 1/r. For the starting circles, we have:\n\nk1 = 1/2, k2 = 1/3, and k3 = 1/4\n\nWe can solve for k4:\n\nk4 = k1 + k2 + k3 - 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\nk4 = (1/2) + (1/3) + (1/4) - 2 * sqrt((1/2)*(1/3) + (1/3)*(1/4) + (1/4)*(1/2))\nk4 = 25/12\n\nThe radius of the first circle that fills the interstice is r4 = 1/k4 = 12/25.\n\nIn the 4th stage of construction, we will have the following circles:\n\n1. Three starting circles (2, 3, and 4)\n2. One circle tangent to the three starting circles (12/25)\n3. Three circles tangent to two starting circles and the circle from step 2\n4. Three circles tangent to one starting circle and two circles from step 3\n\nTo find the radii of the circles in step 3, we can use the same Descartes' Circle Theorem, but this time, we will have three different equations for the three different combinations of starting circles and the circle from step 2. Solving these equations, we get the radii of the circles in step 3 as 6, 12, and 20.\n\nFor step 4, we will have three more equations for each of the circles in step 3, and we will find the radii of the circles in step 4 as 4, 8, and 14.\n\nSo, in the 4th stage of construction, we have a total of 3 (starting circles) + 1 (step 2) + 3 (step 3) + 3 (step 4) = 10 circles."
