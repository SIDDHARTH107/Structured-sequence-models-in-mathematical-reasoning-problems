The wire is oriented perpendicular to the $z$-axis and lies in the $x-y$ plane with its center at the origin, and assume the speed of light to be $3\\times 10^8$ m/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the magnetic field produced by the wire using the Biot-Savart law.\n2. Calculate the electric field produced by the magnetic field using Faraday's law.\n3. Use the Fourier transform to find the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic wave at a distance of 10 cm from the wire.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the magnetic field produced by the wire using the Biot-Savart law\n\nThe Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field $dB$ produced by a small segment of wire carrying current $I$ is given by:\n\n$$dB = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{r}}{r^3}$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space ($4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}$ Tm/A), $d\\vec{l}$ is the vector representing the small segment of wire, $\\vec{r}$ is the position vector from the segment to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated, and $r$ is the magnitude of $\\vec{r}$.\n\nSince the wire is oriented perpendicular to the $z$-axis and lies in the $x-y$ plane, we can write the position vector $\\vec{r}$ as:\n\n$$\\vec{r} = x\\hat{i} + y\\hat{j} + z\\hat{k}$$\n\nThe wire has a length of 12 cm, so it extends from $-6$ cm to $6$ cm along the $z$-axis. We can write the vector $d\\vec{l}$ as:\n\n$$d\\vec{l} = dz\\hat{k}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field produced by the wire:\n\n$$\\vec{B} = \\int_{-6}^{6} \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{2A \\cdot dz\\hat{k} \\times \\vec{r}}{r^3}$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the electric field produced by the magnetic field using Faraday's law\n\nFaraday's law states that the electric field is related to the time-varying magnetic field as:\n\n$$\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}$$\n\nSince the magnetic field is only varying along the $z$-axis, we can write the electric field as:\n\n$$\\vec{E} = E_x(x, y, z)\\hat{i} + E_y(x, y, z)\\hat{j}$$\n\nTo find the components $E_x$ and $E_y$, we can take the curl of the electric field and equate it to the negative time derivative of the magnetic field:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial t}$$\n\nStep 3: Use the Fourier transform to find the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic wave at a distance of 10 cm from the wire\n\nWe can use the Fourier transform to find the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic wave at a distance of 10 cm from the wire:\n\n$$\\vec{E}(k_x, k_y, k_z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\vec{E}(x, y, z) e^{-i(k_x x + k_y y + k_z z)} dx dy dz$$\n\nAt a distance of 10 cm from the wire, we can find the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic wave by evaluating the Fourier transform at the corresponding values of $k_x$, $k_y$, and $k_z$.\n\nNote that this is a complex problem that requires advanced mathematical techniques to solve. The steps outlined above provide a general approach to solving the problem, but the actual calculations would be quite involved and are beyond the scope of a simple text response."
