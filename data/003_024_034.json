    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B using trigonometry, we first need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can do this using the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of A and B is given by:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of A and B:\n\n|A| = √(5² + 2²) = √(25 + 4) = √29\n|B| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA · B = (5)(3) + (2)(4) = 15 + 8 = 23\n\nNow we can find the angle θ using the dot product formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)\ncos(θ) = 23 / (√29 * 5)\ncos(θ) = 23 / (5√29)\n\nNow, we can find the projection of A onto B:\n\nproj_A_onto_B = |A| cos(θ) * (B / |B|)\n\nThe unit vector of B is:\n\nB / |B| = (3/5, 4/5)\n\nNow, we can find the projection:\n\nproj_A_onto_B = (|A| cos(θ)) * (B / |B|)\nproj_A_onto_B = (23 / √29) * (3/5, 4/5)\nproj_A_onto_B = (69/29√29, 92/29√29)\n\nSo, the projection of vector A onto vector B using trigonometry is (69/29√29, 92/29√29)."
