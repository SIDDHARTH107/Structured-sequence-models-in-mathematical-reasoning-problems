    "message_2": "To determine if a graph G is planar or not, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nWe are given that the graph G has 16 vertices (V = 16) and 23 edges (E = 23). We can use the inequality derived from the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n23 ≤ 3(16) - 6\n23 ≤ 48 - 6\n23 ≤ 42\n\nSince the inequality holds true, it is possible that the graph G is planar. However, we need to check one more condition, which is the Kuratowski's theorem. According to Kuratowski's theorem, a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph with 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition).\n\nWithout more information about the specific connections between the vertices in graph G, we cannot definitively determine if it contains a subdivision of K5 or K3,3. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively determine whether the graph G is planar or not."
