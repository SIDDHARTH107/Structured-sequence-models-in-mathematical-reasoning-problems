    "message_1": "What is the angular displacement of the first pendulum of a double pendulum system, if its length is 1 m and the initial angle with the vertical is 30 degrees, and the second pendulum has a length of 2 meters and initial angle with the vertical is 45 degrees, after 5 seconds? Assume the acceleration due to gravity to be 9.81 m/s².",
    "message_2": "The motion of a double pendulum system is highly complex and cannot be solved analytically. To find the angular displacement of the first pendulum after 5 seconds, we need to use numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve the equations of motion for the double pendulum system.\n\nThe equations of motion for a double pendulum system are given by:\n\nθ₁'' = (−g(2m₁+m₂)sinθ₁−m₂gsin(θ₁−2θ₂)−2sin(θ₁−θ₂)m₂(θ₂'²L₂+θ₁'²L₁cos(θ₁−θ₂)))/(L₁(2m₁+m₂−m₂cos(2θ₁−2θ₂)))\n\nθ₂'' = (2sin(θ₁−θ₂)(θ₁'²L₁(m₁+m₂)+g(m₁+m₂)cosθ₁+m₂θ₂'²L₂cos(θ₁−θ₂)))/(L₂(2m₁+m₂−m₂cos(2θ₁−2θ₂)))\n\nwhere θ₁ and θ₂ are the angles of the first and second pendulums with the vertical, L₁ and L₂ are the lengths of the first and second pendulums, m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the first and second pendulums, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nGiven the initial conditions:\n\nL₁ = 1 m\nL₂ = 2 m\nθ₁(0) = 30° = π/6 rad\nθ₂(0) = 45° = π/4 rad\nθ₁'(0) = θ₂'(0) = 0 (assuming the pendulums are initially at rest)\n\nWe can use a numerical method to solve these equations and find the angular displacement of the first pendulum after 5 seconds. However, this requires a computer program or software like MATLAB or Python to perform the calculations."
