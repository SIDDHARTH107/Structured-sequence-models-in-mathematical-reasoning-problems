    "message_1": "In a Cournot competition, two firms are producing identical products and have the same constant marginal cost of $4 per unit. The market demand curve is given by p = 12 - Q, where Q is the total output of both firms. \n\nIf both firms produce an equal quantity of output, what would be the equilibrium output and price in the market?",
    "message_2": "In a Cournot competition, each firm chooses its output level, taking the output level of the other firm as given. Let q1 be the output of firm 1 and q2 be the output of firm 2. The total output in the market is Q = q1 + q2.\n\nThe market demand curve is given by p = 12 - Q, where p is the price and Q is the total output. Since both firms produce an equal quantity of output, we can write q1 = q2. Let q represent the output of each firm, so Q = 2q.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the demand curve as p = 12 - 2q.\n\nEach firm's revenue is given by R = pq. Substituting the demand curve into the revenue equation, we get R = (12 - 2q)q.\n\nTo find the profit for each firm, we subtract the total cost from the revenue. The total cost is given by C = 4q, as the marginal cost is constant at $4 per unit. Therefore, the profit for each firm is:\n\nProfit = R - C = (12 - 2q)q - 4q.\n\nTo find the equilibrium output, we need to find the output level that maximizes the profit for each firm. We do this by taking the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit)/dq = (12 - 2q - 4) - 2q = 0.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n8 - 4q = 0.\n\nSolving for q, we find the equilibrium output for each firm:\n\nq = 8/4 = 2.\n\nSince both firms produce an equal quantity of output, the total output in the market is Q = 2q = 2(2) = 4.\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium price by plugging the total output into the demand curve:\n\np = 12 - 2Q = 12 - 2(4) = 12 - 8 = 4.\n\nThus, the equilibrium output in the market is 4 units, and the equilibrium price is $4."
