    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second and third equations are just multiples of the first equation. Specifically, the second equation is 2 times the first equation, and the third equation is 3 times the first equation. This means that the three equations are not independent, and the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express one variable in terms of the others. Let's solve the first equation for z:\n\nz = x + 2y - 3\n\nNow, we can express the general solution as:\n\nx = x\ny = y\nz = x + 2y - 3\n\nHere, x and y can take any real values, and z will be determined by the values of x and y."
