    "message_2": "To find the fixed points of the dynamical system, we need to set the derivatives equal to zero and solve for x, y, and z:\n\nx' = y + z = 0\ny' = z + x = 0\nz' = -2x - y = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations. From the first equation, we have:\n\nz = -y\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\ny' = -y + x = 0\nx = y\n\nNow, substitute x = y and z = -y into the third equation:\n\nz' = -2x - y = 0\n-2y - y = 0\n-3y = 0\n\nSo, y = 0. Since x = y, x = 0 as well. And since z = -y, z = 0. Therefore, the fixed point of the system is (0, 0, 0).\n\nNow, we need to determine the stability of this fixed point using the Poincaré map method. First, we need to find the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n\nJ(x, y, z) = | ∂x'/∂x  ∂x'/∂y  ∂x'/∂z |\n             | ∂y'/∂x  ∂y'/∂y  ∂y'/∂z |\n             | ∂z'/∂x  ∂z'/∂y  ∂z'/∂z |\n\nJ(x, y, z) = |  0   1   1  |\n             |  1   0   1  |\n             | -2  -1   0  |\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the Jacobian matrix at the fixed point (0, 0, 0):\n\nJ(0, 0, 0) = |  0   1   1  |\n             |  1   0   1  |\n             | -2  -1   0  |\n\nNext, we need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix to determine the stability of the fixed point. The characteristic equation of the matrix is given by:\n\ndet(J - λI) = 0\n\nwhere λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. The determinant of (J - λI) is:\n\n| -λ  1   1  |\n|  1  -λ  1  |\n| -2  -1 -λ  |\n\nComputing the determinant, we get:\n\n-λ((-λ)(-λ) - 1) - 1(1 - (-1)(-2)) + 1(-1 - 2(-1)(-λ)) = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get the characteristic equation:\n\nλ^3 + λ^2 - 2λ - 4 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding the exact eigenvalues can be challenging. However, we can use numerical methods (e.g., Newton-Raphson method) to approximate the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are approximately:\n\nλ1 ≈ -2.24698\nλ2 ≈ 1.12349 + 1.41421i\nλ3 ≈ 1.12349 - 1.41421i\n\nSince there is at least one eigenvalue with a positive real part (λ2 and λ3), the fixed point (0, 0, 0) is unstable according to the Poincaré map method."
