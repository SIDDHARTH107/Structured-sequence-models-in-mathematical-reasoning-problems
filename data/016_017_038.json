    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (2^(n/2))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after the 8th iteration. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(8/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^4)\nLength = 1 * 16\nLength = 16\n\nSo, the length of the Heighway dragon curve after the 8th iteration is 16."
