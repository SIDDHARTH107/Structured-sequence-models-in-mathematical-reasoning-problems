    "message_1": "A metal plate with a temperature distribution given by f(x,y) = 4xy, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2, is in contact with a zero-temperature region along the entire edge of the plate except the bottom y = 0 where the temperature is held at a constant value of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Using Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform, find the steady-state temperature distribution u(x,y) inside the plate.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution u(x, y) inside the plate, we need to solve the Laplace equation:\n\n∇²u(x, y) = 0\n\nwith the given boundary conditions:\n\nu(x, 0) = 60\nu(x, 2) = 0\nu(0, y) = 0\nu(1, y) = 0\n\nWe can use the method of separation of variables to solve this problem. Let u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y), then the Laplace equation becomes:\n\nX''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by X(x)Y(y):\n\nX''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y) = 0\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\nX''(x) / X(x) = -λ²\nY''(y) / Y(y) = λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ²X(x) = 0\nY''(y) - λ²Y(y) = 0\n\nSolve the X equation with the boundary conditions X(0) = X(1) = 0:\n\nX(x) = sin(nπx), where n is an integer.\n\nSolve the Y equation with the boundary condition Y(2) = 0:\n\nY(y) = cosh(λy) = cosh(nπy)\n\nNow we have the general solution:\n\nu(x, y) = ∑[A_n * sin(nπx) * cosh(nπy)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the boundary condition u(x, 0) = 60:\n\n60 = ∑[A_n * sin(nπx)]\n\nWe can find the coefficients A_n using the Fourier sine series:\n\nA_n = (2 / L) * ∫[60 * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\n\nwhere L = 1.\n\nA_n = 2 * ∫[60 * sin(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\nA_n = (120 / nπ) * [-cos(nπ) + 1]\n\nNow we have the coefficients A_n, and we can write the steady-state temperature distribution u(x, y):\n\nu(x, y) = ∑[(120 / nπ) * (-cos(nπ) + 1) * sin(nπx) * cosh(nπy)]\n\nThis is the steady-state temperature distribution inside the plate."
