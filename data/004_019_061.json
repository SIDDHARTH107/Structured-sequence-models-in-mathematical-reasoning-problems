    "message_2": "To find the particle's velocity at time $t=2$, we need to find the first derivative of the position function with respect to time, which represents the velocity function:\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(t^3 - 3t^2 + 2t + 1)$\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$v(t) = 3t^2 - 6t + 2$\n\nNow, we can find the velocity at $t=2$ by plugging in the value into the velocity function:\n\n$v(2) = 3(2)^2 - 6(2) + 2 = 12 - 12 + 2 = 2$\n\nSo, the particle's velocity at time $t=2$ is 2 units per time unit.\n\nNext, to find the particle's acceleration at time $t=2$, we need to find the second derivative of the position function with respect to time, which represents the acceleration function:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}(3t^2 - 6t + 2)$\n\nAgain, using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n$a(t) = 6t - 6$\n\nNow, we can find the acceleration at $t=2$ by plugging in the value into the acceleration function:\n\n$a(2) = 6(2) - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6$\n\nSo, the particle's acceleration at time $t=2$ is 6 units per time unit squared."
