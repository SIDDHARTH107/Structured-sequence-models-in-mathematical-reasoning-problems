    "message_1": "A substitution cipher message has been encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution method. Assuming that there are 26 characters in the English alphabet and each of these characters have been replaced with a different character, how many possible ways are there to encrypt the message?",
    "message_2": "In a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, each character in the English alphabet is replaced with a different character. There are 26 characters in the English alphabet, so for the first character, there are 26 options for substitution. For the second character, there are 25 remaining options, for the third character, there are 24 remaining options, and so on.\n\nTo find the total number of possible ways to encrypt the message, we can calculate the number of permutations of the 26 characters. This can be represented as 26! (26 factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to 26.\n\n26! = 26 × 25 × 24 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000\n\nSo, there are 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 possible ways to encrypt the message using a monoalphabetic substitution method."
