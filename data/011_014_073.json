    "message_2": "When arranging people in a circle, we consider one arrangement to be the same as another if it can be obtained by a rotation. So, we have to divide by the number of people to account for the rotations that give the same arrangement.\n\nThere are 8 people, so there are 8! (8 factorial) ways to arrange them in a line. To account for the rotations, we divide by 8:\n\nNumber of ways to arrange in a circle = (8!)/8 = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)/8\n\nThe 8 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n\nNumber of ways = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 7! = 5,040\n\nSo, there are 5,040 different ways to arrange the 8 people in a circle for the game of \"pass the parcel.\""
