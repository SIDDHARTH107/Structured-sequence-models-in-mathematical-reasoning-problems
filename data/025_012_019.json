    "message_2": "To find the number of points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, we will use the following method:\n\n1. Iterate through all possible $x$ values in $\\mathbb{F}_7$, i.e., $0, 1, 2, \\dots, 6$.\n2. For each $x$ value, compute the right-hand side of the equation: $x^3 + 2x + 2$.\n3. Check if the result is a quadratic residue modulo 7, i.e., if there exists a $y$ in $\\mathbb{F}_7$ such that $y^2 \\equiv x^3 + 2x + 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n4. If the result is a quadratic residue, there are two points on the curve with that $x$ value (corresponding to $y$ and $-y$). If not, there are no points with that $x$ value.\n5. Sum the number of points for all $x$ values and add 1 for the point at infinity.\n\nNow, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. $x$ values in $\\mathbb{F}_7$: $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$\n\n2. Compute the right-hand side of the equation for each $x$ value:\n\n- For $x = 0$: $0^3 + 2\\cdot0 + 2 = 2$\n- For $x = 1$: $1^3 + 2\\cdot1 + 2 = 5$\n- For $x = 2$: $2^3 + 2\\cdot2 + 2 = 16 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\n- For $x = 3$: $3^3 + 2\\cdot3 + 2 = 35 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n- For $x = 4$: $4^3 + 2\\cdot4 + 2 = 74 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$\n- For $x = 5$: $5^3 + 2\\cdot5 + 2 = 137 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\n- For $x = 6$: $6^3 + 2\\cdot6 + 2 = 230 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$\n\n3. Check if the results are quadratic residues modulo 7:\n\n- Quadratic residues modulo 7 are: $0, 1, 2, 4$\n- For $x = 0$: $2$ is a quadratic residue.\n- For $x = 1$: $5$ is not a quadratic residue.\n- For $x = 2$: $2$ is a quadratic residue.\n- For $x = 3$: $0$ is a quadratic residue.\n- For $x = 4$: $4$ is a quadratic residue.\n- For $x = 5$: $2$ is a quadratic residue.\n- For $x = 6$: $1$ is a quadratic residue.\n\n4. Count the number of points for each $x$ value:\n\n- For $x = 0$: 2 points\n- For $x = 1$: 0 points\n- For $x = 2$: 2 points\n- For $x = 3$: 2 points\n- For $x = 4$: 2 points\n- For $x = 5$: 2 points\n- For $x = 6$: 2 points\n\n5. Sum the number of points and add 1 for the point at infinity:\n\n- Total number of points: $2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 13$\n\nTherefore, there are 13 points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 2$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$."
