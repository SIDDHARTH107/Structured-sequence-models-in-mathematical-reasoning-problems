    "message_2": "To find the global minimum value of the cost function C(x) = 5000 + 10x - 0.5x^2, we need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nThe first derivative of C(x) is:\nC'(x) = dC(x)/dx = 10 - x\n\nSetting C'(x) to zero and solving for x:\n10 - x = 0\nx = 10\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point is a minimum by taking the second derivative of the function and evaluating it at x = 10.\n\nThe second derivative of C(x) is:\nC''(x) = d^2C(x)/dx^2 = -1\n\nSince C''(10) = -1, which is negative, the critical point x = 10 is a global minimum.\n\nNow, we can find the global minimum value of C(x) by plugging x = 10 back into the cost function:\n\nC(10) = 5000 + 10(10) - 0.5(10)^2\nC(10) = 5000 + 100 - 50\nC(10) = 5050\n\nSo, the global minimum value of C(x) is 5050, and it is achieved when x = 10 units."
