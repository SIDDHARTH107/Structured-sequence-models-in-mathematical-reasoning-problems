    "message_1": "A farmer wants to maximize his profits by planting two types of crops: wheat and corn. He has 200 acres of land and 400 units of fertilizer. He expects to earn a profit of $100 per acre of wheat and $200 per acre of corn. Wheat requires 2 units of fertilizer per acre, and corn requires 4 units of fertilizer per acre. What is the maximum profit the farmer can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of acres of wheat and y be the number of acres of corn. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. Land constraint: x + y ≤ 200\n2. Fertilizer constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 400\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 100x + 200y.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the fertilizer constraint by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx + 2y ≤ 200\n\nNow, we can solve the system of inequalities graphically or algebraically. In this case, we'll use algebra.\n\nFrom the land constraint, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny ≤ 200 - x\n\nSubstitute this expression for y in the fertilizer constraint:\n\nx + 2(200 - x) ≤ 200\nx + 400 - 2x ≤ 200\n-x ≤ -200\nx ≥ 200\n\nSo, the farmer must plant at least 100 acres of wheat. Now, we can find the corresponding amount of corn:\n\ny ≤ 200 - x\ny ≤ 200 - 100\ny ≤ 100\n\nThe farmer can plant up to 100 acres of corn. Now, we can calculate the maximum profit:\n\nP(x, y) = 100x + 200y\nP(100, 100) = 100(100) + 200(100)\nP(100, 100) = 10,000 + 20,000\nP(100, 100) = $30,000\n\nThe maximum profit the farmer can make is $30,000 by planting 100 acres of wheat and 100 acres of corn."
