    "message_1": "A company A and a company B compete with differentiated products in a Stackelberg competition. Company A is the leader and sets its quantity before company B. The inverse demand function for the market is P(Q) = 100 - Q, where P is the price and Q is the total output quantity in the market. The cost functions for each company are CA(Qa) = 5Qa and CB(Qb) = 5Qb^2. Assuming that Company A sets its quantity first, what is the quantity produced by each company and the market price in equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantities and market price, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the reaction function for Company B (follower).\n2. Find the profit function for Company A (leader) and maximize it to find the optimal quantity for Company A.\n3. Plug the optimal quantity for Company A into Company B's reaction function to find the optimal quantity for Company B.\n4. Find the market price using the inverse demand function.\n\nStep 1: Find the reaction function for Company B\nRevenue for Company B: Rb = P(Q) * Qb = (100 - (Qa + Qb)) * Qb\nCost for Company B: Cb = 5Qb^2\nProfit for Company B: πb = Rb - Cb = (100 - (Qa + Qb)) * Qb - 5Qb^2\n\nTo find the reaction function, we need to maximize Company B's profit with respect to Qb:\nd(πb)/dQb = 100 - 2Qa - 3Qb = 0\nCompany B's reaction function: Qb = (100 - 2Qa) / 3\n\nStep 2: Find the profit function for Company A and maximize it\nRevenue for Company A: Ra = P(Q) * Qa = (100 - (Qa + Qb)) * Qa\nCost for Company A: Ca = 5Qa\nProfit for Company A: πa = Ra - Ca = (100 - (Qa + Qb)) * Qa - 5Qa\n\nSubstitute Company B's reaction function into Company A's profit function:\nπa = (100 - (Qa + ((100 - 2Qa) / 3))) * Qa - 5Qa\n\nSimplify and maximize Company A's profit with respect to Qa:\nd(πa)/dQa = 65 - 5Qa = 0\nOptimal quantity for Company A: Qa = 13\n\nStep 3: Plug the optimal quantity for Company A into Company B's reaction function\nQb = (100 - 2 * 13) / 3 = 74 / 3 ≈ 24.67\n\nStep 4: Find the market price using the inverse demand function\nP(Q) = 100 - Q = 100 - (Qa + Qb) = 100 - (13 + 24.67) ≈ 62.33\n\nIn equilibrium, Company A produces 13 units, Company B produces approximately 24.67 units, and the market price is approximately $62.33."
