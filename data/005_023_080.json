    "message_2": "To find the upper outlier boundary using the interquartile range (IQR) method, we first need to find the first quartile (Q1), the third quartile (Q3), and the IQR. Then, we can calculate the upper outlier boundary using the formula: Upper Outlier Boundary = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.\n\n1. Arrange the data set in ascending order: 10, 12, 14, 15, 80.\n2. Find Q1 (the median of the lower half of the data set):\n   Since there are 5 values, the lower half contains the first 2 values: 10 and 12.\n   Q1 = (10 + 12) / 2 = 11.\n3. Find Q3 (the median of the upper half of the data set):\n   The upper half contains the last 2 values: 15 and 80.\n   Q3 = (15 + 80) / 2 = 47.5.\n4. Calculate the IQR: IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 47.5 - 11 = 36.5.\n5. Calculate the upper outlier boundary: Upper Outlier Boundary = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 47.5 + 1.5 * 36.5 = 47.5 + 54.75 = 102.25.\n\nThe upper outlier boundary for this data set is 102.25."
