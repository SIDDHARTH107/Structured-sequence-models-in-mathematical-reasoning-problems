Therefore:\n\nA intersect B = {3, 4}\n\nNow, let's prove that A intersect B is a subset of set A:\n\nFor every element x in A intersect B, x must also be an element of set A. Since A intersect B = {3, 4}, we can see that both 3 and 4 are elements of set A:\n\n3 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A\n\nThus, A intersect B is a subset of set A.\n\nNext, let's prove that A intersect B is a subset of set B:\n\nFor every element x in A intersect B, x must also be an element of set B.
