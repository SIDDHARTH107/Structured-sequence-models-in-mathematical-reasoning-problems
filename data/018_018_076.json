    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the differences of the two sets.\n\nA Δ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A)\n\nFirst, let's find the differences of the sets A and B:\n\nA - B = {2, 3}\nB - A = {7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these differences:\n\nA Δ B = {2, 3} ∪ {7, 8} = {2, 3, 7, 8}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of sets A and B is {2, 3, 7, 8}.\n\nNow, let's verify whether the symmetric difference is commutative. According to the commutative property, A Δ B should be equal to B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B - A) ∪ (A - B) = {7, 8} ∪ {2, 3} = {2, 3, 7, 8}\n\nSince A Δ B = {2, 3, 7, 8} and B Δ A = {2, 3, 7, 8}, the symmetric difference is commutative."
