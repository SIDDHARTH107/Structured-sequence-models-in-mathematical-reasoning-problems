    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of unique letters in the word \"COMBINATORICS\" and then use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose three different letters.\n\nThe unique letters in \"COMBINATORICS\" are C, O, M, B, I, N, A, T, R, and S. There are 10 unique letters.\n\nThe combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of unique elements, k is the number of elements to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (unique letters) and k = 3 (we want to choose three letters).\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!7!)\n\nC(10, 3) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7!)/(3 × 2 × 1 × 7!)\n\nC(10, 3) = (10 × 9 × 8)/(3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 3) = 720/6\n\nC(10, 3) = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to choose three different letters from the word \"COMBINATORICS\" if the order in which the letters are chosen doesn't matter."
