    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field at a point 1.5 meters from the wire, we can use the Biot-Savart Law, which is derived from Maxwell's equations. The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field (B) due to a current-carrying wire is given by:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)\n\nwhere:\n- B is the magnetic field strength\n- μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A)\n- I is the current in the wire (3 A)\n- r is the distance from the wire (1.5 m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and solve for B:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * π * 1.5 m)\n\nThe π in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nB = (4 × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 3 A) / (2 * 1.5 m)\n\nB = (12 × 10^(-7) T) / (3 m)\n\nB = 4 × 10^(-7) T\n\nSo, the magnetic field at a point 1.5 meters from the wire is 4 × 10^(-7) Tesla."
