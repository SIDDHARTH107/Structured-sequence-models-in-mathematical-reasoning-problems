    "message_1": "Suppose two firms A and B are competing in a Stackelberg model. The inverse demand function is P = 200 – Q, where P is the market price and Q is the total quantity produced by both the firms. Firm A is the leader and produces first with a constant marginal cost of $20 per unit. Firm B follows with a marginal cost of $30 per unit. Determine the quantities produced by each firm and the market price.",
    "message_2": "To determine the quantities produced by each firm and the market price, we first need to find the reaction function of each firm. \n\nFirm A's profit function is given by:\nπ_A = (P - MC_A) * Q_A = (200 - Q - MC_A) * Q_A\n\nFirm B's profit function is given by:\nπ_B = (P - MC_B) * Q_B = (200 - Q - MC_B) * Q_B\n\nWhere MC_A = 20 and MC_B = 30, and Q = Q_A + Q_B.\n\nNow, we need to find the reaction functions for each firm by maximizing their profit functions with respect to their own quantities.\n\nFor Firm A, we take the first-order derivative of π_A with respect to Q_A and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(π_A)/dQ_A = 180 - 2Q_A - Q_B = 0\n\nFor Firm B, we take the first-order derivative of π_B with respect to Q_B and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(π_B)/dQ_B = 170 - Q_A - 2Q_B = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the Nash equilibrium quantities for each firm.\n\nFirst, we can solve the reaction function of Firm B for Q_B:\n\nQ_B = (170 - Q_A) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for Q_B into the reaction function of Firm A:\n\n180 - 2Q_A - ((170 - Q_A) / 2) = 0\n\nMultiplying through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n360 - 4Q_A - 170 + Q_A = 0\n\nCombining terms:\n\n-3Q_A = -190\n\nNow, solve for Q_A:\n\nQ_A = 190 / 3 ≈ 63.33\n\nNow, substitute Q_A back into the expression for Q_B:\n\nQ_B = (170 - 63.33) / 2 ≈ 53.33\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantities for each firm are Q_A ≈ 63.33 and Q_B ≈ 53.33.\n\nNow, we can find the market price by substituting these quantities back into the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 200 - (Q_A + Q_B) = 200 - (63.33 + 53.33) ≈ 83.34\n\nThus, the quantities produced by each firm are approximately 63.33 units for Firm A and 53.33 units for Firm B, and the market price is approximately $83.34."
