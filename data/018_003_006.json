Similarly, C is a superset of set B if every element of B is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ A and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ A and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of A are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n3 ∈ B and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n9 ∈ B and 9 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of B are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, the union of A and B, A ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}, is a superset of each of the sets A and B."
