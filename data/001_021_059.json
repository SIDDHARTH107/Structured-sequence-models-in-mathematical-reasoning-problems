    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x = 0, we can first factor out the common factor of x:\n\nx(x^2 - 6x + 9) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses:\n\nx(x - 3)^2 = 0\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n1) x = 0\n\n2) (x - 3)^2 = 0\n   x - 3 = 0\n   x = 3\n\nSo, the real solutions for the polynomial equation are x = 0 and x = 3."
