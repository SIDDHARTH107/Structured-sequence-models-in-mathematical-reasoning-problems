    "message_1": "Consider the following problem related to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange:\n\nAlice and Bob are using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to securely exchange a secret key. They agree to use a modulus of 23 and a base of 5. Alice chooses a secret key of 6 and computes the corresponding public key. Similarly, Bob chooses a secret key of 15 and computes the corresponding public key. What is the value of the secret key that they both will obtain using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key: A = (base ^ secret_key_Alice) % modulus\n2. Bob computes his public key: B = (base ^ secret_key_Bob) % modulus\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key: S_Alice = (B ^ secret_key_Alice) % modulus\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key: S_Bob = (A ^ secret_key_Bob) % modulus\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\n1. A = (5 ^ 6) % 23 = 15625 % 23 = 8\n2. B = (5 ^ 15) % 23 = 30517578125 % 23 = 19\n3. S_Alice = (19 ^ 6) % 23 = 47045881 % 23 = 2\n4. S_Bob = (8 ^ 15) % 23 = 35184372088832 % 23 = 2\n\nThe shared secret key is 2."
