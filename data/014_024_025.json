    "message_2": "A Caesar shift is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet. In this case, the shift key is 3. To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" with a Caesar shift of 3, we shift each letter 3 positions down the alphabet.\n\nH -> K\nE -> H\nL -> O\nL -> O\nO -> R\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"KHOOR\"."
