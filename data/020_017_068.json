    "message_1": "A rectangular piece of cardboard measuring 12 inches by 16 inches is going to be made into a box by cutting out small and equal squares of side length x from each corner and folding up the sides. What value of x will result in a box with maximum volume?",
    "message_2": "To find the value of x that will result in a box with maximum volume, we need to first express the volume of the box as a function of x.\n\nAfter cutting out the squares of side length x from each corner and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the resulting box will be:\n\nLength: 16 - 2x\nWidth: 12 - 2x\nHeight: x\n\nThe volume of the box, V(x), can be expressed as the product of its length, width, and height:\n\nV(x) = (16 - 2x)(12 - 2x)(x)\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of this function by taking its derivative with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndV(x)/dx = 0\n\nFirst, expand the volume function:\n\nV(x) = 4x^3 - 56x^2 + 192x\n\nNow, find the derivative:\n\ndV(x)/dx = 12x^2 - 112x + 192\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n12x^2 - 112x + 192 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 4:\n\n3x^2 - 28x + 48 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic:\n\n(3x - 8)(x - 6) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x: x = 8/3 and x = 6. However, since the width of the cardboard is 12 inches, x cannot be greater than 12/2 = 6. Therefore, x = 6 is not a valid solution, as it would result in a box with no width.\n\nThus, the value of x that results in a box with maximum volume is x = 8/3 inches."
