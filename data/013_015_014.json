    "message_1": "An advertising agency has been hired by a company to create a social media campaign. The company believes that the campaign will increase their profits by $10,000, but they are not sure if the agency will put in enough effort to maximize the effectiveness of the campaign. The cost of the agency's effort is $2,000. The agency's effort has a direct impact on the effectiveness of the campaign, which is measured by a parameter called \"campaign quality.\" The agency's effort level is represented by a number between 0 and 10, while campaign quality is represented by a number between 0 and 100. If the agency puts in effort level e, the campaign quality is represented as Q(e) = 10e. If the company signs a contract with the agency that specifies that they will be paid $5,000, plus a bonus from the increase in profits due to the campaign over the cost of the agency's effort, what is the optimal level of effort for the agency?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal level of effort for the agency, we need to maximize the agency's profit. The agency's profit is the sum of the fixed payment ($5,000) and the bonus from the increase in profits due to the campaign over the cost of the agency's effort. The bonus can be calculated as the difference between the increase in profits and the cost of the agency's effort.\n\nLet's denote the agency's profit as P(e), the effort level as e, and the campaign quality as Q(e). We know that Q(e) = 10e and the cost of the agency's effort is $2,000.\n\nThe increase in profits due to the campaign is proportional to the campaign quality, so we can write it as k * Q(e), where k is a constant. Since the company believes that the campaign will increase their profits by $10,000 when the campaign quality is 100, we can find the value of k:\n\nk * 100 = 10,000\nk = 10,000 / 100\nk = 100\n\nNow we can write the bonus as (100 * Q(e) - 2,000). The agency's profit function is:\n\nP(e) = 5,000 + (100 * Q(e) - 2,000)\n\nSubstitute Q(e) with 10e:\n\nP(e) = 5,000 + (100 * 10e - 2,000)\nP(e) = 5,000 + (1,000e - 2,000)\n\nTo find the optimal level of effort, we need to maximize P(e). To do this, we can find the derivative of P(e) with respect to e and set it equal to 0:\n\ndP(e)/de = 1,000\n\nSince the derivative is constant and does not depend on e, there is no maximum value for P(e) when e is between 0 and 10. However, the agency's effort level is limited to a maximum of 10. Therefore, the optimal level of effort for the agency is e = 10. At this level of effort, the campaign quality will be Q(10) = 10 * 10 = 100, and the agency's profit will be maximized."
