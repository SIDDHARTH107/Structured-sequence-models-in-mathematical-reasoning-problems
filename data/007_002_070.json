    "message_2": "To find the smallest 3-digit number divisible by 21, we can start by dividing the smallest 3-digit number, 100, by 21.\n\n100 ÷ 21 = 4 with a remainder of 16.\n\nSince there is a remainder, we can add 1 to the quotient (4) and multiply it by 21 to find the smallest 3-digit number divisible by 21.\n\n(4 + 1) × 21 = 5 × 21 = 105.\n\nSo, the smallest 3-digit number divisible by 21 is 105."
