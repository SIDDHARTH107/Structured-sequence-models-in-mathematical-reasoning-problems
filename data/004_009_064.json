    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x) * (4x - 5) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions that are being multiplied together. In this case, we have:\n\nu(x) = x^2 + 3x\nv(x) = 4x - 5\n\nNext, we find the derivatives of these two functions:\n\nu'(x) = d(u(x))/dx = 2x + 3\nv'(x) = d(v(x))/dx = 4\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of the product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for u(x), u'(x), v(x), and v'(x):\n\nf'(x) = (2x + 3)(4x - 5) + (x^2 + 3x)(4)\n\nNow, we expand and simplify the expression:\n\nf'(x) = 8x^2 - 10x + 12x - 15 + 4x^3 + 12x^2\nf'(x) = 4x^3 + (8x^2 + 12x^2) + (2x + 12x) - 15\nf'(x) = 4x^3 + 20x^2 + 14x - 15\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x) * (4x - 5) is:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 + 20x^2 + 14x - 15"
