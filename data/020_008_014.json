    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance, we can use the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm. However, solving TSP for 10 locations is computationally expensive, and it's not feasible to do it manually. Instead, we can try to find an approximate solution using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, which is a heuristic method.\n\nStarting from location A, we can follow the nearest neighbor algorithm:\n\n1. A -> I (1 mile)\n2. I -> J (3 miles)\n3. J -> F (6 miles)\n4. F -> G (2 miles)\n5. G -> D (3 miles)\n6. D -> B (5 miles)\n7. B -> H (5 miles)\n8. H -> C (7 miles)\n9. C -> E (5 miles)\n10. E -> A (8 miles)\n\nTotal distance: 1 + 3 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 5 + 8 = 45 miles\n\nPlease note that this solution is not guaranteed to be the shortest route, but it's an approximation using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. To find the exact shortest route, you would need to use a more advanced algorithm or software specifically designed for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem."
