    "message_1": "Consider the polynomial equation in two variables: $f(x,y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3xy$. This equation is invariant under the action of the group $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^2$ given by rotating the coordinate axes by $120$ degrees. \n\nCompute the number of solutions in $(x,y)$ to the equation $f(x,y) = 0$ that are fixed by the action of $G$, i.e., that satisfy $(x,y) = (g\\cdot x,g\\cdot y)$ for all $g \\in G$, where $g\\cdot (x,y)$ denotes the action of $g$ on the point $(x,y)$.",
    "message_2": "To find the fixed points under the action of $G$, we need to find the points $(x, y)$ such that $f(x, y) = 0$ and $(x, y) = (g \\cdot x, g \\cdot y)$ for all $g \\in G$. \n\nLet's first find the action of $g \\in G$ on $(x, y)$. A $120^\\circ$ rotation in the complex plane can be represented by multiplication by $e^{2\\pi i/3} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i$. So, the action of $g$ on $(x, y)$ can be represented as:\n\n$$(x, y) \\mapsto \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2}y\\right).$$\n\nNow, we want to find the points $(x, y)$ such that $(x, y) = (g \\cdot x, g \\cdot y)$ for all $g \\in G$. This means that:\n\n$$x = -\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2}y.$$\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{3}{2}x = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x = \\frac{1}{2}y.$$\n\nDividing the second equation by the first, we get:\n\n$$y = -\\sqrt{3}x.$$\n\nNow, substituting this back into the equation $f(x, y) = 0$, we get:\n\n$$x^3 - 3\\sqrt{3}x^3 - 3x(-\\sqrt{3}x) = 0.$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$x^3(1 - 3\\sqrt{3} + 3\\sqrt{3}) = 0.$$\n\nThus, $x = 0$. Since $y = -\\sqrt{3}x$, we also have $y = 0$. Therefore, there is only one fixed point under the action of $G$, which is $(0, 0)$."
