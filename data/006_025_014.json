    "message_1": "A magician has 8 red balls, 5 green balls, and 7 blue balls. If he chooses one ball at random, what is the probability that it is a red ball?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of choosing a red ball, we need to divide the number of red balls by the total number of balls.\n\nTotal number of balls = 8 red balls + 5 green balls + 7 blue balls = 20 balls\n\nProbability of choosing a red ball = (Number of red balls) / (Total number of balls) = 8/20\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.\n\n8 รท 4 = 2\n20 รท 4 = 5\n\nSo, the probability of choosing a red ball is 2/5."
