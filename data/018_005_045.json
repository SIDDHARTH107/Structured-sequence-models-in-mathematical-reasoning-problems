    "message_2": "To calculate the intersection of A and its complement, we first need to define the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. Let's assume U contains all the integers from 1 to 10:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we can find the complement of A, denoted as A'. A' contains all the elements in U that are not in A:\n\nA' = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, we can find the intersection of A and A', denoted as A ∩ A'. The intersection contains all the elements that are common to both A and A':\n\nA ∩ A' = {}\n\nSince there are no common elements between A and A', the intersection is the empty set, denoted as {}. Therefore, the intersection of A and its complement is equal to the empty set."
