    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $$\\sqrt{72}$$, we need to find the prime factors of 72 and then pair them up.\n\nFirst, find the prime factors of 72:\n$$72 = 2 × 36$$\n$$36 = 2 × 18$$\n$$18 = 2 × 9$$\n$$9 = 3 × 3$$\n\nSo, the prime factors of 72 are: $$2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3$$\n\nNow, pair up the prime factors:\n$$\\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3}$$\n\nFor each pair of the same number, we can take one number out of the square root:\n$$\\sqrt{2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3} = 2\\sqrt{2 × 3 × 3} = 2\\sqrt{18}$$\n\nThus, the simplified radical expression is: $$2\\sqrt{18}$$."
