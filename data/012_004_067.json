The distances between the buildings are shown in the table below:\n\n|       | A    | B    | C    | D    | E    | F    | G    |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| A     | 0    | 7    | 9    | 12   | -    | -    | -    |\n| B     | 7    | 0    | 5    | 4    | 10   | -    | -    |\n| C     | 9    | 5    | 0    | -    | 6    | 14   | -    |\n| D     | 12   | 4    | -    | 0    | 2    | 8    | 10   |\n| E     | -    | 10   | 6    | 2    | 0    | 11   | 3    |\n| F     | -    | -    | 14   | 8    | 11   | 0    | 6    |\n| G     | -    | -    | -    | 10   | 3    | 6    | 0    |\n\nAssume the cable company wants to connect all buildings together while minimizing cable usage. What is the minimum amount of cable the company needs to use to create a network that connects all the buildings together?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use Kruskal's algorithm, which is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. Here's how the algorithm works:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weight.\n2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If not, include this edge. Else, discard it.\n3. Repeat step 2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree, where V is the number of vertices.\n\nLet's apply Kruskal's algorithm to this problem:\n\n1. Sort all the edges:\n\n(2, D, E), (3, E, G), (4, B, D), (5, B, C), (6, C, E), (6, F, G), (7, A, B), (8, D, F), (9, A, C), (10, B, E), (10, D, G), (11, E, F), (12, A, D), (14, C, F)\n\n2. Pick the smallest edge and check for cycles:\n\n- Add (2, D, E) to the spanning tree.\n- Add (3, E, G) to the spanning tree.\n- Add (4, B, D) to the spanning tree.\n- Add (5, B, C) to the spanning tree.\n- (6, C, E) would form a cycle, so discard it.\n- Add (6, F, G) to the spanning tree.\n- Add (7, A, B) to the spanning tree.\n\n3. We have added (V-1) = 6 edges to the spanning tree, so we can stop here.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree has the following edges: (2, D, E), (3, E, G), (4, B, D), (5, B, C), (6, F, G), (7, A, B)\n\nThe minimum amount of cable needed is the sum of the weights of these edges: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 27. So, the company needs to use at least 27 units of cable to connect all the buildings together."
