    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of G, we need to find the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's try to color the graph using the greedy coloring algorithm:\n\n1. Color vertex 1 with color A.\n2. Color vertex 2 with color B (since it's connected to vertex 1 with color A).\n3. Color vertex 3 with color A (since it's connected to vertex 2 with color B).\n4. Color vertex 4 with color B (since it's connected to vertex 1 with color A).\n5. Color vertex 5 with color C (since it's connected to vertices 1, 2, and 4 with colors A and B).\n6. Color vertex 6 with color B (since it's connected to vertices 3 and 5 with colors A and C).\n7. Color vertex 7 with color A (since it's connected to vertices 5 and 6 with colors C and B).\n\nWe have successfully colored the graph with 3 colors: A, B, and C. Therefore, the chromatic number of G is 3."
