    "message_2": "Yes, it is possible to draw a graph that satisfies this degree sequence. Here's one such graph:\n\nLabel the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Assign the degrees as follows:\n\nA: 2\nB: 2\nC: 3\nD: 3\nE: 3\nF: 4\nG: 4\n\nNow, connect the vertices with edges to satisfy the degree sequence:\n\n1. Connect A to F and G (A's degree is now 2)\n2. Connect B to F and G (B's degree is now 2)\n3. Connect C to F, G, and D (C's degree is now 3)\n4. Connect D to E (D's degree is now 3)\n5. Connect E to F and G (E's degree is now 3)\n6. F and G are already connected to A, B, C, and E, so their degrees are already 4.\n\nThe resulting graph satisfies the given degree sequence."
