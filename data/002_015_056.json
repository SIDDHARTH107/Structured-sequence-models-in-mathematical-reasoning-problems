    "message_2": "The perimeter (also known as the circumference) of a circle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius.\n\nGiven a radius (r) of 6 cm, we can calculate the circumference as follows:\n\nC = 2 * 3.14159 * 6\nC ≈ 37.69908\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circle with a radius of 6 cm is approximately 37.7 cm."
