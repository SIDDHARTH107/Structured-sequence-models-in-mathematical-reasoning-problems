    "message_1": "A high tide is expected to occur at 6:30 am at a certain beach. The water level is modeled by the function h(t) = 3 sin(π/6 (t - 6.5)) + 5, where h is the height of the water in feet and t is the time in hours after midnight. What is the phase shift of the wave function?",
    "message_2": "The phase shift of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal shift of the function from its standard position. In this case, the function is given by h(t) = 3 sin(π/6 (t - 6.5)) + 5. The phase shift can be determined by looking at the term inside the sine function.\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function is A sin(B(t - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In this case, the function is h(t) = 3 sin(π/6 (t - 6.5)) + 5, so the phase shift is C = 6.5.\n\nTherefore, the phase shift of the wave function is 6.5 hours."
