    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of the graph G, we will use the fact that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in an undirected graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nLet's denote the girth of the graph G as g. We know that G has 9 vertices and 14 edges. If the girth of G is 3, then G contains a triangle (a cycle of length 3). In this case, the graph G would be a planar graph, and we can apply the inequality:\n\ne ≤ 3v - 6\n\nwhere e is the number of edges and v is the number of vertices.\n\nFor our graph G, we have:\n\n14 ≤ 3 * 9 - 6\n14 ≤ 27 - 6\n14 ≤ 21\n\nThe inequality holds, so it is possible that the girth of the graph G is 3. Therefore, the girth of the graph G is 3."
