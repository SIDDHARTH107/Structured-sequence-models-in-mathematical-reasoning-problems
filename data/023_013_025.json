    "message_1": "A metal rod of length 0.5 meters is initially at a uniform temperature of 50 degrees Celsius. At time t=0, one end of the rod is heated to 100 degrees Celsius and the other end is kept at 0 degrees Celsius. Using Fourier transform, find the temperature distribution along the rod at time t=1 second if the thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.1 m^2/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation with the given boundary conditions and initial temperature distribution. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nBoundary conditions:\nT(0, t) = 100°C\nT(0.5, t) = 0°C\n\nInitial condition:\nT(x, 0) = 50°C\n\nWe can use the method of separation of variables to solve this problem. Let T(x, t) = X(x)T(t), then the heat equation becomes:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = α T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nDivide both sides by αXT:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X) ∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\n(1/αT) ∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X) ∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n∂T(t)/∂t = -αλ²T(t)   (1)\n∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²X(x)   (2)\n\nSolve equation (2) with the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = 100\nX(0.5) = 0\n\nThe solution is:\n\nX(x) = C1 * cosh(λx) + C2 * sinh(λx)\n\nApply the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = C1 * cosh(0) + C2 * sinh(0) = 100\nX(0.5) = C1 * cosh(0.5λ) + C2 * sinh(0.5λ) = 0\n\nFrom the first boundary condition, we get C1 = 100. Substitute C1 into the second boundary condition and solve for C2:\n\n100 * cosh(0.5λ) + C2 * sinh(0.5λ) = 0\nC2 = -100 * coth(0.5λ)\n\nNow, X(x) = 100 * (cosh(λx) - coth(0.5λ) * sinh(λx))\n\nNext, solve equation (1):\n\n∂T(t)/∂t = -αλ²T(t)\n\nThe solution is:\n\nT(t) = e^(-αλ²t)\n\nNow, the temperature distribution T(x, t) is given by the product of X(x) and T(t):\n\nT(x, t) = 100 * (cosh(λx) - coth(0.5λ) * sinh(λx)) * e^(-αλ²t)\n\nTo find the temperature distribution at t = 1 second, substitute t = 1 and α = 0.1 m²/s into the equation:\n\nT(x, 1) = 100 * (cosh(λx) - coth(0.5λ) * sinh(λx)) * e^(-0.1λ²)\n\nThis equation gives the temperature distribution along the rod at time t = 1 second. Note that λ is determined by the boundary conditions and the specific material properties of the metal rod."
