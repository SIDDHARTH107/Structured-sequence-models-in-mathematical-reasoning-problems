    "message_2": "To solve this integral equation, we will use the Cauchy integral formula. The Cauchy integral formula states that if a function $f(z)$ is analytic in a simply connected domain $D$ containing a simple closed contour $C$ and its interior, then for any point $z_0$ inside $C$,\n\n$$\nf(z_0) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz\n$$\n\nNow, let's rewrite the given integral equation as\n\n$$\nf(z) = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{f(t)}{t-z} dt\n$$\n\nLet's consider the contour integral\n\n$$\n\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz\n$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a contour that encloses the real axis. We can split this contour integral into two parts: one along the real axis and another along the rest of the contour.\n\n$$\n\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{f(t)}{t - z_0} dt + \\int_{C'} \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz\n$$\n\nwhere $C'$ is the part of the contour that does not lie on the real axis. Now, we can substitute the expression for $f(z)$ from the integral equation into the contour integral:\n\n$$\n\\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{t - z_0} dt + \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{f(t)}{(t - z_0)(t - z)} dt + \\int_{C'} \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz\n$$\n\nBy the Cauchy integral formula, the left-hand side is equal to $2\\pi i f(z_0)$ if $z_0$ is inside the contour $C$ and 0 otherwise. Thus, we have\n\n$$\n2\\pi i f(z_0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{t - z_0} dt + \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{f(t)}{(t - z_0)(t - z)} dt + \\int_{C'} \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz\n$$\n\nNow, we can take the limit as the contour $C$ goes to infinity. In this limit, the integral along $C'$ vanishes, and we are left with\n\n$$\n2\\pi i f(z_0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{t - z_0} dt + \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{f(t)}{(t - z_0)(t - z)} dt\n$$\n\nComparing this equation with the original integral equation, we see that they are the same, with $z_0$ replacing $z$. Thus, the function $f(z)$ is analytic everywhere in the complex plane, and the integral equation is satisfied for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nTo find the explicit form of $f(z)$, we can use the fact that the function $1/(t - z)$ has a simple pole at $t = z$. Thus, we can write\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{t - z} = \\frac{A}{t - z} + B\n$$\n\nfor some constants $A$ and $B$. By comparing the residues at the pole, we find that $A = 1$ and $B = 0$. Thus, the integral equation becomes\n\n$$\nf(z) = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{f(t)}{t - z} dt\n$$\n\nThis equation is satisfied by the function $f(z) = 1$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. Thus, the unique analytic solution to the given integral equation is $f(z) = 1$."
