    "message_2": "We know that the order of G is 60, which can be factored as 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 15 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 20 and is congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 12 and is congruent to 1 mod 5, so n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where n_2 = 1. In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, P_2, of order 4. Since there are 15 elements of order 4 in G, all of these elements must be in P_2. This implies that P_2 is cyclic, and G has a normal subgroup of order 4. Let P_3 and P_5 be Sylow 3 and 5-subgroups of G, respectively. Since P_2 is normal in G, the product P_2P_3 is a subgroup of G, and |P_2P_3| = |P_2||P_3|/|P_2 ∩ P_3| = 12. Similarly, the product P_2P_5 is a subgroup of G with order 20. Now, we have three cases:\n\n1. If n_3 = n_5 = 1, then G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which is C_3 × C_5 × C_2 = C_60, the cyclic group of order 60.\n\n2. If n_3 > 1 and n_5 > 1, then G has at least 4 + 6 - 1 = 9 elements of order 3 or 5. Adding the 15 elements of order 4, we have at least 24 non-identity elements in G. Since G has 59 non-identity elements, there are at least 35 elements left. These elements must form a normal subgroup N of G, since the index of N in G is 2, which is the smallest prime divisor of |G|. Thus, G is an extension of N by a group of order 2. Since N is a group of order 30, it is either cyclic or a semidirect product of C_3 and C_5. In the first case, G is isomorphic to A_5 × C_2. In the second case, G is one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\n3. If n_3 = 1 and n_5 > 1, or n_3 > 1 and n_5 = 1, then G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup or a normal Sylow 5-subgroup. In either case, G is an extension of a group of order 12 or 20 by a group of order 2 or 3. This again leads to G being isomorphic to A_5 × C_2 or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 60 with 15 elements of order 4, then G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C60, A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60."
