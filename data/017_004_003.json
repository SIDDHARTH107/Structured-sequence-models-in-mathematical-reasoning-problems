    "message_2": "To find all possible groups of order 25, we will use the Sylow Theorems. Let G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2, we know that G has a Sylow 5-subgroup, say P. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Since the order of G is 25, the only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 5. However, if n_5 = 5, then there would be 5 * (5 - 1) = 20 elements of order 5 in G, leaving only 5 elements of order 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, n_5 = 1, and P is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G.\n\nSince P is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of G, it must be normal in G. Now, we know that the order of P is 5^2 = 25, so P is a group of order 25. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P must be isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C_25, the cyclic group of order 25.\n2. C_5 × C_5, the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nWe will now show that every group of order 25 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then it is isomorphic to C_25, and we are done.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIf G is not cyclic, then it cannot be isomorphic to C_25. Therefore, it must be isomorphic to C_5 × C_5, the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. To see this, let a and b be generators of two distinct cyclic subgroups of G, each of order 5. Since G is not cyclic, the order of the element ab cannot be 25. Thus, the order of ab must be 5. Now, consider the subgroup H generated by a and b. Since the orders of a, b, and ab are all 5, H must be isomorphic to C_5 × C_5.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 25 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
