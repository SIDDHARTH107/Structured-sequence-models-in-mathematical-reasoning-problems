    "message_1": "A 20N force is applied to an object moving in a straight line for a distance of 10m. The force is applied at an angle of 30° to the direction of the object's motion. Find the work done by the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force, we need to calculate the component of the force that is in the direction of the object's motion. We can do this using the cosine of the angle between the force and the direction of motion.\n\nThe component of the force in the direction of motion is Fx = F * cos(θ), where F is the force, θ is the angle between the force and the direction of motion, and Fx is the component of the force in the direction of motion.\n\nIn this case, F = 20N and θ = 30°. So, we have:\n\nFx = 20 * cos(30°) = 20 * (√3/2) = 10√3 N\n\nNow, we can find the work done by the force using the formula W = Fx * d, where W is the work done, Fx is the component of the force in the direction of motion, and d is the distance the object moves.\n\nIn this case, Fx = 10√3 N and d = 10m. So, we have:\n\nW = 10√3 * 10 = 100√3 J\n\nTherefore, the work done by the force is 100√3 Joules."
