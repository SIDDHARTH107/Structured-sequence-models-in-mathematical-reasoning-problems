    "message_2": "The genus (g) of a complete graph with n vertices can be determined using the formula:\n\ng = (e - n + 1)/2\n\nwhere e is the number of edges in the graph and n is the number of vertices.\n\nFor a complete graph with n vertices, the number of edges (e) can be calculated using the formula:\n\ne = n(n - 1)/2\n\nFor a complete graph with 7 vertices (K7):\n\ne = 7(7 - 1)/2 = 7(6)/2 = 21\n\nNow, we can find the genus (g) using the formula:\n\ng = (e - n + 1)/2 = (21 - 7 + 1)/2 = (14)/2 = 7\n\nSo, the genus of a complete graph with 7 vertices (K7) is 7."
