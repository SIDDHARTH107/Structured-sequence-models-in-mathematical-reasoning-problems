    "message_2": "To find the area of a right triangle using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 11 cm. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 8 cm * 11 cm\n\nArea = 4 cm * 11 cm\n\nArea = 44 cmÂ²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 44 square centimeters."
