    "message_2": "The given equation x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 defines a circle in the complex plane ℂ^2. However, since we are working with complex coordinates, this circle is actually a 2-dimensional real manifold embedded in ℂ^2, which is topologically equivalent to a 2-dimensional sphere S^2.\n\nTo compute the second cohomology group of X with coefficients in ℤ, we can use the fact that the cohomology groups of a topological space are invariant under homeomorphism. Since X is homeomorphic to S^2, we can compute the cohomology groups of S^2 instead.\n\nThe cohomology groups of the 2-sphere S^2 are well-known:\n\nH^0(S^2; ℤ) = ℤ (the constant functions)\nH^1(S^2; ℤ) = 0 (there are no nontrivial closed 1-forms on S^2)\nH^2(S^2; ℤ) = ℤ (the volume form generates this group)\n\nTherefore, the second cohomology group of X with coefficients in ℤ is:\n\nH^2(X; ℤ) = H^2(S^2; ℤ) = ℤ."
