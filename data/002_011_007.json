    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg measuring 5 cm and the hypotenuse measuring 13 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). The formula is:\n\na² + b² = c²\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nIn this problem, we know one leg (a) is 5 cm and the hypotenuse (c) is 13 cm. We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\n5² + b² = 13²\n25 + b² = 169\nb² = 169 - 25\nb² = 144\nb = √144\nb = 12\n\nThe length of the other leg is 12 cm."
