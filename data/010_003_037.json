    "message_2": "Proof:\n\nSince A and B are disjoint closed subsets of X, their complements, A^c and B^c, are open sets in X. Now, let's define the open sets U and V as follows:\n\nU = A^c ∩ B\nV = B^c ∩ A\n\nNotice that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V, because A ⊆ B^c and B ⊆ A^c by definition of complements. Furthermore, U and V are disjoint, because if there exists an element x in U ∩ V, then x must be in both A^c ∩ B and B^c ∩ A. This implies that x is in both A^c and B^c, which contradicts the fact that A and B are disjoint closed sets. Therefore, U and V are disjoint open sets such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nNow, let's find the number of distinct topologies on a set X with 10 elements that satisfy the T1 separation axiom.\n\nA topological space X is said to satisfy the T1 separation axiom if for any two distinct points x and y in X, there exist open sets U and V such that x ∈ U, y ∉ U, and y ∈ V, x ∉ V.\n\nFor a set with 10 elements, there are 2^10 = 1024 possible subsets. For each pair of distinct points x and y, there are 3 possible relationships between the open sets containing them: (1) x ∈ U, y ∉ U; (2) x ∉ V, y ∈ V; (3) x ∈ U, y ∉ U, and x ∉ V, y ∈ V. Therefore, there are 3^(10 choose 2) possible ways to assign these relationships to the pairs of points in X.\n\nHowever, not all of these assignments will result in a topology that satisfies the T1 separation axiom. To count the number of valid topologies, we can use the following inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|T1 topologies| = |total assignments| - |invalid assignments|\n\nTo count the invalid assignments, we can consider the cases where at least one pair of points does not satisfy the T1 separation axiom. There are (10 choose 2) such pairs, and for each pair, there are 2^(10 choose 2) - 1 ways to assign the relationships to the other pairs.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle, we get:\n\n|T1 topologies| = 3^(10 choose 2) - (10 choose 2) * (2^(10 choose 2) - 1)\n\n|T1 topologies| = 3^45 - 45 * (2^45 - 1)\n\n|T1 topologies| ≈ 1.4 * 10^21\n\nSo, there are approximately 1.4 * 10^21 distinct topologies on a set with 10 elements that satisfy the T1 separation axiom."
