    "message_2": "The Riemann mapping theorem states that any simply connected open subset of the complex plane can be conformally mapped to the unit disk. However, in this case, we are given a specific function f(z) = (2z - 1)/(3z + 4) and asked to find the image of S under this function. We will proceed by finding the image of the boundary of S under f(z) and then deduce the image of S.\n\nThe region S is defined as the open disk centered at z = 1 with radius 3, i.e., |z - 1| < 3. The boundary of S is the circle |z - 1| = 3. Let's parameterize the boundary of S using the polar form: z = 1 + 3e^(iθ), where θ ∈ [0, 2π).\n\nNow, we will find the image of the boundary of S under f(z):\n\nf(z) = f(1 + 3e^(iθ)) = (2(1 + 3e^(iθ)) - 1) / (3(1 + 3e^(iθ)) + 4)\n       = (2 + 6e^(iθ) - 1) / (3 + 9e^(iθ) + 4)\n       = (1 + 6e^(iθ)) / (7 + 9e^(iθ))\n\nLet w = f(z). Then, we have:\n\nw = (1 + 6e^(iθ)) / (7 + 9e^(iθ))\n\nWe want to find the image of the boundary of S, so we will solve for w in terms of θ:\n\n(7 + 9e^(iθ))w = 1 + 6e^(iθ)\n7w + 9we^(iθ) = 1 + 6e^(iθ)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of w:\n\n|w|^2 = |7w + 9we^(iθ) - 6e^(iθ)|^2\n       = |(7w - 6)e^(iθ) + 9w|^2\n\nLet x = e^(iθ). Then, we have:\n\n|w|^2 = |(7w - 6)x + 9w|^2\n\nSince |z|^2 = z * conjugate(z), we can write:\n\n|w|^2 = ((7w - 6)x + 9w) * ((7w - 6)conjugate(x) + 9conjugate(w))\n\nNow, we know that |x| = |e^(iθ)| = 1, so x * conjugate(x) = 1. Therefore, we can substitute x * conjugate(x) in the equation:\n\n|w|^2 = ((7w - 6)x + 9w) * ((7w - 6) + 9conjugate(w))\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n|w|^2 = (7w - 6)(7w - 6) + 9(7w - 6)conjugate(w) + 9w(7w - 6) + 81|w|^2\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n80|w|^2 = 49w^2 - 84w^3 + 36w^4 + 126wconjugate(w) - 108w^2conjugate(w)\n\nSince the left side of the equation is real, the imaginary part of the right side must be zero. Therefore, the imaginary part of the right side is:\n\nIm(49w^2 - 84w^3 + 36w^4) = 0\n\nThis equation represents the image of the boundary of S under f(z). Unfortunately, this equation is quite complicated and does not have a simple closed-form solution. However, we can still deduce some properties of the image of S under f(z).\n\nSince f(z) is a rational function, it is continuous and holomorphic on its domain. Therefore, the image of the open disk S under f(z) will be an open set in the complex plane. Moreover, the image of the boundary of S will be a closed curve in the complex plane, and the image of S will be the region enclosed by this curve.\n\nIn conclusion, the image of S under f(z) is an open region in the complex plane enclosed by the curve defined by the equation Im(49w^2 - 84w^3 + 36w^4) = 0."
