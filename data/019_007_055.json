    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem related to non-monotonic logic:\n\nBob has a pet bird named Joey. Joey can usually fly and sing, but sometimes he loses his voice or gets too tired to fly. Bob knows that if Joey can fly, then he can also sing. However, if Joey loses his voice, then Bob knows that he cannot fly that day. Yesterday, Bob saw Joey flying, but he did not hear him singing. Today, Bob sees Joey sitting still and not making any sound. Can Bob conclude that Joey cannot fly?\n\nWhat can Bob's conclusion be based on non-monotonic logic?",
    "message_2": "In non-monotonic logic, conclusions are drawn based on the information available, and these conclusions can be revised when new information is obtained. In this case, Bob has the following information:\n\n1. If Joey can fly, then he can also sing.\n2. If Joey loses his voice, then he cannot fly that day.\n3. Yesterday, Bob saw Joey flying but did not hear him singing.\n4. Today, Bob sees Joey sitting still and not making any sound.\n\nBased on this information, Bob cannot definitively conclude that Joey cannot fly today. It is possible that Joey is just resting or choosing not to sing at the moment. However, if Bob were to learn that Joey has lost his voice today, then he could conclude that Joey cannot fly, based on the second piece of information.\n\nIn non-monotonic logic, Bob's conclusion would be that he cannot be certain whether Joey can fly today or not, given the current information. If more information becomes available, such as Joey losing his voice or starting to sing, Bob can revise his conclusion accordingly."
