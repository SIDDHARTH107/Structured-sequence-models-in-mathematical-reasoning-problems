    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120 that are not cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 and two cyclic groups of order 2, we first need to find the total number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. Using the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of the number of groups of each prime power order, we have:\n\n- There are 5 groups of order 2^3 (including the cyclic group of order 8).\n- There are 2 groups of order 3 (including the cyclic group of order 3).\n- There is 1 group of order 5 (the cyclic group of order 5).\n\nNow, we need to consider all possible combinations of these groups:\n\n1. One group of order 2^3, one group of order 3, and one group of order 5: 5 * 2 * 1 = 10 possibilities.\n2. One group of order 2^3 and one group of order 15 (3 * 5): 5 * 1 = 5 possibilities.\n3. One group of order 8 (2^3) and one group of order 3 * 5^2: 5 * 1 = 5 possibilities.\n\nSo, there are a total of 10 + 5 + 5 = 20 non-isomorphic groups of order 120.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the groups that are cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 and two cyclic groups of order 2:\n\n- There is 1 cyclic group of order 120.\n- There is 1 group isomorphic to the direct product of A5 and two cyclic groups of order 2.\n\nSo, there are 20 - 1 - 1 = 18 non-isomorphic groups of order 120 that are not cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 and two cyclic groups of order 2."
