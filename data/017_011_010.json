    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C12, A4, or D6, we will first analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet p and q be distinct prime divisors of |G|. By the Sylow theorems, the number of p-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_p, must divide q and satisfy n_p ≡ 1 (mod p). Similarly, the number of q-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_q, must divide p and satisfy n_q ≡ 1 (mod q).\n\nSince |G| = 12 = 2^2 * 3, we have p = 2 and q = 3. Thus, n_2 must divide 3 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2), which implies n_2 ∈ {1, 3}. Similarly, n_3 must divide 4 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3), which implies n_3 ∈ {1, 4}.\n\nNow, we consider the following cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup Q. Since both P and Q are normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 4 * 3 / 1 = 12, which implies that G = PQ. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is the cyclic group C12.\n\n2. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup Q, which is normal in G. Let P be any 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, |P| = 4, and P is isomorphic to either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If P is isomorphic to C4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q, which is the dihedral group D6. If P is isomorphic to V4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of P and Q, which is the alternating group A4.\n\n3. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: This case is symmetric to case 2, and the same conclusions apply.\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: In this case, there are no normal Sylow subgroups in G, which contradicts the fact that the product of the orders of all Sylow subgroups must equal |G|. Thus, this case is not possible.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6. To find the specific isomorphism between G and one of these groups, one would need additional information about the structure of G or its elements."
