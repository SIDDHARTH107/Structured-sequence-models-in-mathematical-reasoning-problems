    "message_1": "In a community of 200 households, 60 have at least one child who plays soccer. If a household is selected at random, what is the probability that it has a child who plays soccer?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a household having at least one child who plays soccer, we need to divide the number of households with a soccer-playing child by the total number of households.\n\nNumber of households with a soccer-playing child = 60\nTotal number of households = 200\n\nProbability = (Number of households with a soccer-playing child) / (Total number of households)\nProbability = 60 / 200\n\nNow, we simplify the fraction:\n\nProbability = 3 / 10\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected household has a child who plays soccer is 3/10 or 0.3 or 30%."
