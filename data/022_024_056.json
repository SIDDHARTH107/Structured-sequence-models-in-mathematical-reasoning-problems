    "message_1": "Suppose that the initial temperature distribution in a semi-infinite rod is given by $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ for $x>0$. The rod is insulated at $x=0$ and the right end is held at zero temperature. Use complex analysis techniques to determine the temperature distribution $u(x,t)$ at a later time $t>0$ if the thermal diffusivity of the rod is $\\alpha=1$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Laplace transform method. The heat equation for a semi-infinite rod with thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$ is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$$\n\nTaking the Laplace transform with respect to time, we get:\n\n$$sU(x,s) - u(x,0) = \\alpha U''(x,s)$$\n\nwhere $U(x,s)$ is the Laplace transform of $u(x,t)$ and $u(x,0) = f(x) = \\sin(x)$. Now, we have the following ordinary differential equation:\n\n$$\\alpha U''(x,s) - sU(x,s) = -\\sin(x)$$\n\nwith boundary conditions $U'(0,s) = 0$ (insulated at $x=0$) and $U(x,s) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$ (right end held at zero temperature).\n\nTo solve this ODE, we first find the homogeneous solution, which satisfies:\n\n$$\\alpha U''(x,s) - sU(x,s) = 0$$\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\n$$\\alpha m^2 - s = 0 \\implies m = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{s}{\\alpha}}$$\n\nSince $\\alpha = 1$, the homogeneous solution is:\n\n$$U_h(x,s) = A(s)e^{\\sqrt{s}x} + B(s)e^{-\\sqrt{s}x}$$\n\nNow, we need to find a particular solution for the inhomogeneous equation. We can use the method of variation of parameters. Let $A(s) = A_1(s)e^{\\sqrt{s}x}$ and $B(s) = B_1(s)e^{-\\sqrt{s}x}$. Then, we have:\n\n$$U_p(x,s) = A_1(s)e^{\\sqrt{s}x} + B_1(s)e^{-\\sqrt{s}x}$$\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n$$U_p'(x,s) = \\sqrt{s}A_1(s)e^{\\sqrt{s}x} - \\sqrt{s}B_1(s)e^{-\\sqrt{s}x}$$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions. From $U'(0,s) = 0$, we have:\n\n$$\\sqrt{s}A_1(s) - \\sqrt{s}B_1(s) = 0 \\implies A_1(s) = B_1(s)$$\n\nSince $U(x,s) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$, we must have $A_1(s) = 0$. Therefore, the particular solution is:\n\n$$U_p(x,s) = B_1(s)e^{-\\sqrt{s}x}$$\n\nNow, we need to find $B_1(s)$ such that:\n\n$$\\alpha U_p''(x,s) - sU_p(x,s) = -\\sin(x)$$\n\nPlugging in $U_p(x,s)$ and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$B_1(s)(s - 1)e^{-\\sqrt{s}x} = -\\sin(x)$$\n\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform of both sides, we obtain:\n\n$$B_1(s) = \\frac{1}{s - 1}\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{e^{-\\sqrt{s}x}\\sin(x)\\}$$\n\nNow, we can write the solution for $U(x,s)$ as:\n\n$$U(x,s) = U_p(x,s) = B_1(s)e^{-\\sqrt{s}x}$$\n\nFinally, we take the inverse Laplace transform to find the temperature distribution $u(x,t)$:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{U(x,s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{B_1(s)e^{-\\sqrt{s}x}\\}$$\n\nUsing tables of Laplace transforms, we find that:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{t}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_0^t \\frac{x\\sin(x\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau}{t-\\tau}})}{\\sqrt{\\tau(t-\\tau)}}d\\tau$$\n\nThis is the temperature distribution $u(x,t)$ at a later time $t>0$ for the given initial temperature distribution and boundary conditions."
