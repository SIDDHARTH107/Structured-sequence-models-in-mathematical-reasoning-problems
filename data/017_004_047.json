    "message_2": "A group of order 25 has 25 elements. Since 25 is a prime number squared (25 = 5^2), there are two possible structures for a group of order 25:\n\n1. Cyclic group: A group of order 25 can be a cyclic group, denoted as C_25 or Z_25. In this case, the group has a single generator, and every element in the group can be expressed as a power of the generator. The group operation is usually addition modulo 25.\n\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: A group of order 25 can also be the direct product of two smaller cyclic groups of orders 5 and 5, denoted as C_5 Ã— C_5. In this case, the group elements can be represented as ordered pairs (a, b), where a and b are elements of the smaller cyclic groups C_5. The group operation is performed component-wise, i.e., (a, b) * (c, d) = (a * c, b * d).\n\nThese are the two possible structures for a group of order 25, up to isomorphism."
