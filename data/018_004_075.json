    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to define a universal set U that contains A. Let's assume that the universal set U contains all integers from 1 to 11, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. \n\nThe complement of set A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Therefore, A' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}.\n\nNow, we can find A' by comparing the elements in U and A:\n\nA' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}\n\nTo prove that the complement of set A is unique, we need to show that there is no other set that can be the complement of A in the given universal set U.\n\nSuppose there is another set B such that B ≠ A' and B is also the complement of A in U. This means that there exists an element x ∈ B such that x ∉ A'. Since B is the complement of A, x must not be in A. However, this contradicts the fact that A' contains all elements in U that are not in A. Therefore, there cannot be another set B that is the complement of A in U.\n\nHence, the complement of set A, A' = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, is unique."
