    "message_2": "The Duffing oscillator is a nonlinear oscillator described by the following differential equation:\n\nx''(t) + δx'(t) + αx(t) + βx(t)^3 = γcos(ωt)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement, x'(t) is the velocity, x''(t) is the acceleration, δ is the damping coefficient, α is the spring constant, β is the nonlinear coefficient, γ is the amplitude of the external force, and ω is the angular frequency of the external force.\n\nIn this case, we have δ = 0.3, α = 0.8, β = 0.2, and an amplitude of 1.4. However, we don't have information about the external force (γ) and its angular frequency (ω). Therefore, it's not possible to determine the period of the Duffing oscillator with the given information.\n\nThe period of the Duffing oscillator depends on the parameters and initial conditions, and it can be found through numerical simulations or approximations. In general, the period is not a simple function of the parameters, and it can be different for different initial conditions."
