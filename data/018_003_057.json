    "message_2": "To find the union of sets A and B, we combine all the elements from both sets without repeating any element. The union of sets A and B is denoted as A ∪ B.\n\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7}\nB = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the resulting set (A ∪ B) is a superset of both set A and set B. A set C is a superset of set A if every element of A is also an element of C. Similarly, a set C is a superset of set B if every element of B is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ A and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n7 ∈ A and 7 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of set A are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n8 ∈ B and 8 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of set B are also elements of A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have proved that the resulting set A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} is a superset of both set A and set B."
