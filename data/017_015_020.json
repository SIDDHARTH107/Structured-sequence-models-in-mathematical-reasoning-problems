    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 24, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 24: 24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible groups for each prime factor using the formula: n_p = (p^(k+1) - 1) / (p - 1), where p is the prime factor and k is its exponent in the prime factorization.\n\nFor p = 2 and k = 3, we have:\nn_2 = (2^(3+1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = (16 - 1) / 1 = 15\n\nFor p = 3 and k = 1, we have:\nn_3 = (3^(1+1) - 1) / (3 - 1) = (9 - 1) / 2 = 4\n\n3. Multiply the number of possible groups for each prime factor to get the total number of groups of order 24:\nTotal number of groups = n_2 * n_3 = 15 * 4 = 60\n\nHowever, this number includes isomorphic groups, so we need to eliminate them from the count. To do this, we can use the following facts:\n\n- There are 3 abelian groups of order 24: Z_24, Z_2 x Z_12, and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_6.\n- There are 2 non-abelian groups of order 24 with a normal Sylow 2-subgroup: the semidirect product of Z_4 and Z_3 (which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_12) and the semidirect product of Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 and Z_3.\n- There are 10 non-abelian groups of order 24 with a normal Sylow 3-subgroup: 5 are extensions of Z_3 by Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2, and 5 are extensions of Z_3 by Z_4 x Z_2.\n- There is 1 non-abelian group of order 24 with no normal Sylow subgroups: the symmetric group S_4.\n\nSo, in total, there are 3 abelian + 2 normal Sylow 2 + 10 normal Sylow 3 + 1 no normal Sylow = 16 non-isomorphic groups of order 24."
