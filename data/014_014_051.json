    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Playfair cipher, we first need to divide the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, we insert an 'X' between them. In this case, we have:\n\nMA - TH - EM - AT - IC - SX\n\nNow, we will use the Playfair matrix to encrypt each pair:\n\n1. MA: M is in row 3, column 2 and A is in row 1, column 3. So, we swap the columns to get the encrypted pair: row 3, column 3 (Q) and row 1, column 2 (L). Encrypted pair: QL\n2. TH: T is in row 3, column 5 and H is in row 2, column 5. So, we swap the rows to get the encrypted pair: row 2, column 5 (O) and row 3, column 4 (S). Encrypted pair: OS\n3. EM: E is in row 2, column 3 and M is in row 3, column 2. So, we form a rectangle and take the opposite corners: row 2, column 2 (R) and row 3, column 3 (Q). Encrypted pair: RQ\n4. AT: A is in row 1, column 3 and T is in row 3, column 5. So, we form a rectangle and take the opposite corners: row 1, column 5 (F) and row 3, column 3 (Q). Encrypted pair: FQ\n5. IC: I is in row 2, column 1 and C is in row 2, column 3. So, we swap the columns to get the encrypted pair: row 2, column 3 (E) and row 2, column 1 (I). Encrypted pair: EI\n6. SX: S is in row 3, column 4 and X is in row 4, column 5. So, we form a rectangle and take the opposite corners: row 3, column 5 (T) and row 4, column 4 (W). Encrypted pair: TW\n\nNow, we combine the encrypted pairs to get the final encrypted message: QLOS RQFQ EITW"
