The cost of laying the cable between the factories is given as follows:\nFactory A to B: $8,000\nFactory A to C: $11,000\nFactory A to D: $5,000\nFactory A to E: $13,000\nFactory B to C: $6,000\nFactory B to D: $12,000\nFactory B to E: $9,000\nFactory C to D: $7,000\nFactory C to E: $8,000\nFactory D to E: $10,000\n\nWhat is the minimum cost to connect all five factories? Use the minimum spanning tree algorithm to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum cost to connect all five factories, we will use the Kruskal's algorithm for the minimum spanning tree. First, we list all the edges in ascending order of their weights:\n\n1. A to D: $5,000\n2. B to C: $6,000\n3. C to D: $7,000\n4. A to B: $8,000\n5. C to E: $8,000\n6. B to E: $9,000\n7. A to C: $11,000\n8. D to E: $10,000\n9. B to D: $12,000\n10. A to E: $13,000\n\nNow, we will add the edges to the minimum spanning tree one by one, making sure not to form any cycles:\n\n1. Add edge A to D: $5,000 (Connected nodes: A, D)\n2. Add edge B to C: $6,000 (Connected nodes: A, B, C, D)\n3. We cannot add edge C to D since it would form a cycle with the existing edges.\n4. Add edge A to B: $8,000 (Connected nodes: A, B, C, D)\n5. Add edge C to E: $8,000 (Connected nodes: A, B, C, D, E)\n\nNow all five factories are connected, and the minimum cost is the sum of the weights of the edges in the minimum spanning tree:\n\n$5,000 + $6,000 + $8,000 + $8,000 = $27,000\n\nThe minimum cost to connect all five factories is $27,000."
