    "message_1": "Consider a signaling game where the sender has two messages to choose from with equal probability. The receiver correctly interprets the message with probability 0.8 if the sender is truthful and with probability 0.4 if the sender lies. If the sender's objective is to have the receiver correctly interpret the message, what is the sender's optimal strategy?",
    "message_2": "To find the sender's optimal strategy, we need to compare the probabilities of the receiver correctly interpreting the message when the sender is truthful and when the sender lies.\n\nLet's denote the two messages as M1 and M2. The sender chooses either M1 or M2 with equal probability, i.e., 0.5. \n\nCase 1: Sender is truthful\nThe probability of the receiver correctly interpreting the message is 0.8. Since the sender chooses either M1 or M2 with equal probability, the overall probability of correct interpretation when the sender is truthful is:\n\nP(correct interpretation | truthful) = 0.5 * 0.8 (M1) + 0.5 * 0.8 (M2) = 0.4 + 0.4 = 0.8\n\nCase 2: Sender lies\nThe probability of the receiver correctly interpreting the message is 0.4. Since the sender chooses either M1 or M2 with equal probability, the overall probability of correct interpretation when the sender lies is:\n\nP(correct interpretation | lies) = 0.5 * 0.4 (M1) + 0.5 * 0.4 (M2) = 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4\n\nComparing the probabilities, we can see that the sender's optimal strategy is to be truthful, as it results in a higher probability (0.8) of the receiver correctly interpreting the message compared to when the sender lies (0.4)."
