    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, K)$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for any divisor $D$ on a curve $C$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$,\n\nwhere $l(D)$ denotes the dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, D)$, and $\\deg(D)$ denotes the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nIn our case, we want to find $l(K)$, so we can set $D = K$. Since $C$ is a genus 3 curve, we have $g = 3$. The canonical divisor $K$ has degree $2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4$. Thus, we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\n$l(K) - l(K - K) = \\deg(K) + 1 - g$.\n\nSince $K - K$ is the zero divisor, we have $l(K - K) = 1$. Therefore,\n\n$l(K) - 1 = 4 + 1 - 3$,\n\nwhich implies\n\n$l(K) = 3$.\n\nSo the dimension of the vector space $H^0(C, K)$ is 3."
