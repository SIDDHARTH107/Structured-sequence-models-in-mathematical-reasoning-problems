    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms, A and B, producing identical products in a Cournot duopoly. Firm A's marginal cost is $2/unit and Firm B's marginal cost is $4/unit. The inverse demand function for the product is P = 24 - Q, where Q is the total output of both firms. What will be the quantities produced by each firm and the market price when they reach the Nash equilibrium?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium in a Cournot duopoly, we need to find the reaction functions for both firms. The reaction function shows the best response of one firm to the output of the other firm. \n\nLet qA and qB be the quantities produced by Firm A and Firm B, respectively. The total output Q is the sum of the outputs of both firms: Q = qA + qB.\n\nThe inverse demand function is P = 24 - Q. We can substitute Q with qA + qB: P = 24 - (qA + qB).\n\nNow, we need to find the profit functions for both firms. Profit is equal to total revenue minus total cost. \n\nFirm A's profit function: πA = (P * qA) - (2 * qA)\nFirm B's profit function: πB = (P * qB) - (4 * qB)\n\nSubstitute the inverse demand function into the profit functions:\n\nπA = ((24 - (qA + qB)) * qA) - (2 * qA)\nπB = ((24 - (qA + qB)) * qB) - (4 * qB)\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to take the first derivative of the profit functions with respect to each firm's output and set it equal to zero.\n\n∂πA/∂qA = 22 - 2qA - qB = 0\n∂πB/∂qB = 20 - 2qB - qA = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of linear equations to find the Nash equilibrium quantities for both firms.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express qA in terms of qB:\n\nqA = 11 - 0.5qB\n\nSubstitute this expression into the second equation:\n\n20 - 2qB - (11 - 0.5qB) = 0\n\nSimplify and solve for qB:\n\n9 - 1.5qB = 0\nqB = 6\n\nNow, substitute qB back into the expression for qA:\n\nqA = 11 - 0.5(6)\nqA = 8\n\nSo, in the Nash equilibrium, Firm A will produce 8 units, and Firm B will produce 6 units. To find the market price, substitute these quantities back into the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 24 - (8 + 6)\nP = 24 - 14\nP = $10\n\nIn the Nash equilibrium, Firm A produces 8 units, Firm B produces 6 units, and the market price is $10."
