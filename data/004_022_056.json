    "message_1": "A company wants to build a rectangular storage facility with a total area of 400 square meters. They want to enclose the storage facility with a fence on three sides, and use the wall of an existing building as the fourth side. What should the dimensions of the storage facility be in order to minimize the cost of the fence while still maintaining the given area constraint? The cost of fencing material is 10 dollars per meter for the three sides of the fence.",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the storage facility be L meters and the width be W meters. The area constraint is given by:\n\nL * W = 400\n\nThe cost of the fence is 10 dollars per meter, and since the fence is only on three sides, the total cost of the fence (C) can be represented as:\n\nC = 10 * (L + 2W)\n\nWe want to minimize the cost of the fence while maintaining the area constraint. To do this, we can first express L in terms of W using the area constraint:\n\nL = 400 / W\n\nNow, substitute this expression for L into the cost equation:\n\nC = 10 * (400 / W + 2W)\n\nTo minimize the cost, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of C with respect to W and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dW = 10 * (-400 / W^2 + 2) = 0\n\nSolving for W:\n\n-400 / W^2 + 2 = 0\n400 / W^2 = 2\nW^2 = 200\nW = sqrt(200)\n\nW ≈ 14.14 meters\n\nNow, we can find the length L using the area constraint:\n\nL = 400 / W\nL = 400 / 14.14\nL ≈ 28.28 meters\n\nSo, the dimensions of the storage facility that minimize the cost of the fence while maintaining the given area constraint are approximately 28.28 meters by 14.14 meters."
