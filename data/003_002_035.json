    "message_2": "To find the values of sin θ, cos θ, and tan θ for an angle of 60 degrees, we can use the following relationships:\n\nsin θ = opposite / hypotenuse\ncos θ = adjacent / hypotenuse\ntan θ = opposite / adjacent\n\nFor a 60-degree angle, we can use a 30-60-90 triangle, which has side lengths in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. In this triangle, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is √3, the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle is 1, and the hypotenuse is 2.\n\nNow, we can find the values of sin θ, cos θ, and tan θ:\n\nsin 60° = (√3) / 2\ncos 60° = 1 / 2\ntan 60° = (√3) / 1 = √3\n\nSo, the values of sin 60°, cos 60°, and tan 60° are:\n\nsin 60° = √3 / 2\ncos 60° = 1 / 2\ntan 60° = √3"
