    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 2, we will first find the derivative with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 4.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x), can be found using the power rule:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2)/dx - d(8x)/dx + d(2)/dx\n\nThe power rule states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1), where n is a constant.\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\nf'(x) = (6x) - (8) + (0) = 6x - 8\n\nNow, we will evaluate f'(x) at x = 4:\n\nf'(4) = 6(4) - 8 = 24 - 8 = 16\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 8x + 2 at x = 4 is 16."
