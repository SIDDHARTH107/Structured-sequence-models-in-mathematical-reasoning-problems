    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products of the sets:\n\n1. (A x B) x C:\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A x B) with C:\n(A x B) x C = {((1,3),2), ((1,3),3), ((1,4),2), ((1,4),3), ((2,3),2), ((2,3),3), ((2,4),2), ((2,4),3)}\n\n2. A x (B x C):\nB x C = {(3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3)}\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of A with (B x C):\nA x (B x C) = {(1,(3,2)), (1,(3,3)), (1,(4,2)), (1,(4,3)), (2,(3,2)), (2,(3,3)), (2,(4,2)), (2,(4,3))}\n\nNow, let's use set builder notation to represent these sets:\n\n(A x B) x C = {((a,b),c) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B, c ∈ C} = {((1,3),2), ((1,3),3), ((1,4),2), ((1,4),3), ((2,3),2), ((2,3),3), ((2,4),2), ((2,4),3)}\n\nA x (B x C) = {(a,(b,c)) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B, c ∈ C} = {(1,(3,2)), (1,(3,3)), (1,(4,2)), (1,(4,3)), (2,(3,2)), (2,(3,3)), (2,(4,2)), (2,(4,3))}\n\nAlthough the elements of the sets (A x B) x C and A x (B x C) look different, they represent the same relationships between the elements of sets A, B, and C. We can show that they are equal by establishing a one-to-one correspondence between their elements:\n\n((1,3),2) ↔ (1,(3,2))\n((1,3),3) ↔ (1,(3,3))\n((1,4),2) ↔ (1,(4,2))\n((1,4),3) ↔ (1,(4,3))\n((2,3),2) ↔ (2,(3,2))\n((2,3),3) ↔ (2,(3,3))\n((2,4),2) ↔ (2,(4,2))\n((2,4),3) ↔ (2,(4,3))\n\nSince there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of (A x B) x C and A x (B x C), we can conclude that they are equal."
