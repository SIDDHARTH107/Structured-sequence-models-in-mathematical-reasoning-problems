    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve does not change after any number of iterations. It remains constant and can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/S)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, there are N = 4 self-similar pieces, and the scaling factor is S = 3 (each segment is divided into three equal parts, and four new segments are created).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Koch curve is:\n\nD = log(4) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.2619\n\nThus, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve after the 5th iteration, or any other iteration, is approximately 1.2619."
