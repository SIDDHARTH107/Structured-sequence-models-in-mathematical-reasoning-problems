    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle, we need to find the angle opposite the smallest side, which is 7 units. Let's call this angle A, and the other two sides adjacent to angle A as sides b and c (10 and 12 units, respectively). We can use the Law of Cosines to find angle A:\n\ncos(A) = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / (2 * b * c)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ncos(A) = (10^2 + 12^2 - 7^2) / (2 * 10 * 12)\ncos(A) = (100 + 144 - 49) / 240\ncos(A) = (195) / 240\ncos(A) ≈ 0.8125\n\nNow, we need to find the angle A by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 0.8125:\n\nA = arccos(0.8125)\nA ≈ 36.25°\n\nSo, the smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 36.25°."
