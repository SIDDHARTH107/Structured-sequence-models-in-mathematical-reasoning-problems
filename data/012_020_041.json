    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms.\n\nTo find the automorphism group of graph G, we need to find all possible permutations of its vertices that preserve adjacency. Let's label the vertices as follows:\n\n```\n1 -- 2\n|    |\n4 -- 3\n```\n\nNow, let's find the automorphisms:\n\n1. Identity automorphism: This is the trivial automorphism where each vertex is mapped to itself. It is always an element of the automorphism group.\n```\n1 -> 1\n2 -> 2\n3 -> 3\n4 -> 4\n```\n\n2. Rotation by 90 degrees clockwise:\n```\n1 -> 2\n2 -> 3\n3 -> 4\n4 -> 1\n```\n\n3. Rotation by 180 degrees:\n```\n1 -> 3\n2 -> 4\n3 -> 1\n4 -> 2\n```\n\n4. Rotation by 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counterclockwise):\n```\n1 -> 4\n2 -> 1\n3 -> 2\n4 -> 3\n```\n\n5. Reflection about the vertical axis:\n```\n1 -> 4\n2 -> 3\n3 -> 2\n4 -> 1\n```\n\n6. Reflection about the horizontal axis:\n```\n1 -> 2\n2 -> 1\n3 -> 4\n4 -> 3\n```\n\n7. Reflection about the diagonal from vertex 1 to vertex 3:\n```\n1 -> 3\n2 -> 2\n3 -> 1\n4 -> 4\n```\n\n8. Reflection about the diagonal from vertex 2 to vertex 4:\n```\n1 -> 1\n2 -> 4\n3 -> 3\n4 -> 2\n```\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms of graph G. Therefore, the automorphism group of graph G is:\n\n{Identity, Rotation by 90 degrees, Rotation by 180 degrees, Rotation by 270 degrees, Reflection about the vertical axis, Reflection about the horizontal axis, Reflection about the diagonal (1-3), Reflection about the diagonal (2-4)}"
