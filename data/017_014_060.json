    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 20. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G (denoted by n_2) must divide the index of the Sylow 2-subgroup, which is 20/4 = 5, and must be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the given groups:\n\n1. C20: The cyclic group of order 20 has a unique subgroup of order 2, namely the one generated by the element of order 2. Therefore, C20 has only one subgroup of order 2.\n\n2. D10: The dihedral group of order 20 (D10) has 10 elements of order 2: the reflections. Each of these elements generates a distinct subgroup of order 2. Therefore, D10 has 10 subgroups of order 2.\n\n3. The non-abelian group of order 20: This group is the semidirect product of C5 and C4, denoted as C5 ⋊ C4. The number of subgroups of order 2 in this group can be determined by considering the action of C4 on C5. Since C5 is of odd order, the only possible action of C4 on C5 is trivial. Thus, the non-abelian group of order 20 is isomorphic to the direct product C5 × C4. The number of subgroups of order 2 in this group is the same as the number of subgroups of order 2 in C4, which is 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the possible number of subgroups of order 2 that a group of order 20 can have is either 1 or 10. Among the given groups, C20 and the non-abelian group of order 20 have 1 subgroup of order 2, while D10 has 10 subgroups of order 2."
