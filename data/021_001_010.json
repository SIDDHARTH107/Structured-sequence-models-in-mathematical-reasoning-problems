    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination method, we need to perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system of equations is:\n\n|  2  3 -1 |  8 |\n| -4  2  1 | -2 |\n|  3 -2  1 |  1 |\n\nStep 1: Add 2 times the first row to the second row to eliminate the x term in the second row.\n\n|  2  3 -1 |  8 |\n|  0  8  1 | 14 |\n|  3 -2  1 |  1 |\n\nStep 2: Add -1.5 times the first row to the third row to eliminate the x term in the third row.\n\n|  2   3  -1 |  8  |\n|  0   8   1 | 14  |\n|  0  -6.5  2 | -11 |\n\nStep 3: Divide the second row by 8 to get a leading 1 in the second row.\n\n|  2   3   -1 |  8    |\n|  0   1  1/8 | 7/4  |\n|  0  -6.5  2 | -11 |\n\nStep 4: Add 6.5 times the second row to the third row to eliminate the y term in the third row.\n\n|  2   3   -1 |  8    |\n|  0   1  1/8 | 7/4  |\n|  0   0 17/4 | 3/4  |\n\nStep 5: Divide the third row by 17/4 to get a leading 1 in the third row.\n\n|  2   3   -1 |  8   |\n|  0   1  1/8 | 7/4 |\n|  0   0   1  | 1/2 |\n\nNow, we have the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 1/2.\n\nFrom the second row, we have y + 1/8 * z = 7/4. Substituting the value of z, we get y = 3/2.\n\nFrom the first row, we have 2x + 3y - z = 8. Substituting the values of y and z, we get x = 1.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 3/2, and z = 1/2."
