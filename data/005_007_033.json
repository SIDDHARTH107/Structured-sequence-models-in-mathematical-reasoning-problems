    "message_1": "What is the correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied and the grade obtained by a group of 25 math students, if the average number of hours studied by the students is 7 hours per week, the standard deviation is 3 hours, the average grade obtained by the students is 85 out of 100, and the standard deviation of the grades is 8 points?",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r), we need more information, specifically the covariance between the number of hours studied and the grades obtained. The correlation coefficient is calculated using the following formula:\n\nr = Cov(X, Y) / (SD(X) * SD(Y))\n\nwhere Cov(X, Y) is the covariance between the number of hours studied (X) and the grades obtained (Y), SD(X) is the standard deviation of the number of hours studied, and SD(Y) is the standard deviation of the grades.\n\nWe have the standard deviations (SD(X) = 3 hours and SD(Y) = 8 points), but we don't have the covariance. Without the covariance, we cannot calculate the correlation coefficient."
