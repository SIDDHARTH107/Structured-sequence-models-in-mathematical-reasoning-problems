    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. To find the minimum size of a vertex cover, we can use the fact that the size of a minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of a maximum matching.\n\nA matching is a set of edges such that no two edges share a common vertex. The maximum matching is the largest possible matching in a graph. In this case, we have a graph G with 7 vertices and 10 edges.\n\nTo find the maximum matching, we can use the following inequality:\n\nsize of maximum matching ≤ (1/2) * number of vertices\n\nIn our case, the number of vertices is 7, so:\n\nsize of maximum matching ≤ (1/2) * 7 = 3.5\n\nSince the size of the maximum matching must be an integer, we can round down to get:\n\nsize of maximum matching ≤ 3\n\nNow, we know that the size of a minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of a maximum matching. Therefore, the minimum size of a vertex cover for this graph is 3."
