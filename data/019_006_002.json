    "message_1": "Here's a question related to Deontic logic:\n\nA company has a policy that requires all employees to attend a training session on workplace safety. The company also has a rule that states that employees who fail to attend the training session will be fined $100. Suppose that a group of 50 employees were scheduled to attend the training session, but only 45 of them showed up. How much money will the company collect from fines, assuming that there are no extenuating circumstances?",
    "message_2": "Since 5 employees failed to attend the training session, and each employee who fails to attend is fined $100, the company will collect:\n\n5 employees * $100 per employee = $500 in fines."
