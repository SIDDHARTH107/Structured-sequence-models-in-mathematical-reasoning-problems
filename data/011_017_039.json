    "message_2": "A 3x3 Latin square is a 3x3 grid where each row and each column contains the digits 1, 2, and 3 exactly once. To count the number of distinct Latin squares, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Fill in the first row with the digits 1, 2, and 3 in any order. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to do this, which is 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways.\n\n2. Now, we need to fill in the second row. Since each column must contain each digit exactly once, there are only 2 possible ways to fill in the second row, given the first row. For example, if the first row is (1, 2, 3), the second row can be either (2, 3, 1) or (3, 1, 2).\n\n3. Finally, we fill in the third row. Given the first two rows, there is only 1 way to fill in the third row, as each digit must appear exactly once in each column.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct 3x3 Latin squares is 6 (ways to fill the first row) × 2 (ways to fill the second row) × 1 (way to fill the third row) = 12."
