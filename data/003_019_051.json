    "message_2": "To find the integral of the function f(x) = sin(x)cos(x) over the interval [0, π/2], we can use integration by substitution. Let's use the substitution:\n\nu = sin(x)\ndu/dx = cos(x)\ndx = du/cos(x)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\n∫sin(x)cos(x) dx = ∫u du\n\nNow, we need to change the limits of integration according to our substitution. When x = 0:\n\nu = sin(0) = 0\n\nWhen x = π/2:\n\nu = sin(π/2) = 1\n\nSo, our new limits of integration are [0, 1]. Now, we can evaluate the integral:\n\n∫u du from 0 to 1 = (1/2)u^2 | from 0 to 1 = (1/2)(1)^2 - (1/2)(0)^2 = 1/2\n\nSo, the integral of the function f(x) = sin(x)cos(x) over the interval [0, π/2] is 1/2."
