    "message_2": "First, we need to represent the given system of linear equations in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the constant column vector.\n\nA = | 1  1  1 |      x = | x |      b = |  6  |\n    | 2  4  4 |          | y |          | 16  |\n    | 4  4  9 |          | z |          | 29  |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. The Cholesky decomposition is a decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. In our case, A is a real symmetric positive-definite matrix, so we can decompose it into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its transpose L^T: A = LL^T.\n\nLet L = | l11  0    0  |, then L^T = | l11  l21  l31 |\n           | l21  l22  0  |            |  0   l22  l32 |\n           | l31  l32  l33 |            |  0    0   l33 |\n\nWe can find the elements of L by solving the following equations derived from A = LL^T:\n\n1) l11^2 = 1\n2) l21*l11 = 1\n3) l31*l11 = 4\n4) l21^2 + l22^2 = 4\n5) l31*l21 + l32*l22 = 4\n6) l31^2 + l32^2 + l33^2 = 9\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n1) l11 = 1\n2) l21 = 1\n3) l31 = 4\n4) l22 = sqrt(3)\n5) l32 = 0\n6) l33 = sqrt(5)\n\nSo, L = | 1  0       0   | and L^T = | 1  1       4   |\n           | 1  sqrt(3)  0   |            | 0  sqrt(3)  0   |\n           | 4  0       sqrt(5) |            | 0  0       sqrt(5) |\n\nNow, we will solve the system Ly = b for y:\n\n| 1  0       0   | | y1 |   |  6  |\n| 1  sqrt(3)  0   | | y2 | = | 16  |\n| 4  0       sqrt(5) | | y3 |   | 29  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\ny1 = 6\ny2 = 2sqrt(3)\ny3 = 1\n\nNow, we will solve the system L^Tx = y for x:\n\n| 1  1       4   | | x |   |  6  |\n| 0  sqrt(3)  0   | | y | = | 2sqrt(3) |\n| 0  0       sqrt(5) | | z |   |  1  |\n\nSolving this system, we get:\n\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 3\n\nSo, the solution for the given system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3."
