    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors given their magnitudes and the angle between them, we can use the formula:\n\n|A x B| = |A| * |B| * sin(θ)\n\nwhere |A x B| is the magnitude of the cross product, |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nIn this case, |A| = 5 units, |B| = 4 units, and θ = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nθ = 60 * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n|A x B| = 5 * 4 * sin(π/3)\n|A x B| = 20 * (√3/2)\n|A x B| = 10√3 units\n\nThe direction of the cross product is perpendicular to the plane formed by the two vectors A and B. Since A points towards the positive x-axis and B points towards the positive y-axis, their cross product will point in the positive z-direction.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the cross product is 10√3 units, and its direction is in the positive z-direction."
