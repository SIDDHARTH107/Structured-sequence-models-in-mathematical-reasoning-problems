    "message_1": "A factory produces two kinds of products, P1 and P2. The profit per unit of P1 and P2 are $15 and $20, respectively. The factory has a total of 500 labor hours available for production each day. Producing one unit of P1 requires 2 labor hours and producing one unit of P2 requires 3 labor hours. Write a firefly algorithm to maximize the total profit per day, and determine the optimal number of units of P1 and P2 to produce each day.",
    "message_2": "The Firefly Algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the behavior of fireflies. In this case, we will use the Firefly Algorithm to find the optimal number of units of P1 and P2 to produce each day to maximize the total profit.\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Number of fireflies (n): 50\n   - Maximum iterations (max_iter): 100\n   - Absorption coefficient (gamma): 1.0\n   - Attractiveness (beta0): 2.0\n   - Randomization parameter (alpha): 0.5\n\n2. Create an initial population of fireflies with random positions (x, y) representing the number of units of P1 and P2 produced.\n\n3. Define the objective function:\n   - Profit = 15 * P1 + 20 * P2\n   - Constraints: 2 * P1 + 3 * P2 <= 500, P1 >= 0, P2 >= 0\n\n4. Evaluate the fitness of each firefly based on the objective function.\n\n5. For each iteration:\n   a. Update the attractiveness of each firefly based on their distance to other fireflies.\n   b. Move the fireflies towards the brighter (more attractive) fireflies.\n   c. Apply randomization to the fireflies' positions.\n   d. Evaluate the fitness of each firefly based on the objective function.\n   e. Update the best solution found so far.\n\n6. After the maximum number of iterations, return the best solution found.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the Firefly Algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\ndef objective_function(p1, p2):\n    profit = 15 * p1 + 20 * p2\n    if 2 * p1 + 3 * p2 <= 500 and p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0:\n        return profit\n    else:\n        return -np.inf\n\ndef distance(f1, f2):\n    return np.sqrt((f1[0] - f2[0])**2 + (f1[1] - f2[1])**2)\n\ndef attractiveness(beta0, gamma, dist):\n    return beta0 * np.exp(-gamma * dist)\n\ndef firefly_algorithm(n, max_iter, gamma, beta0, alpha):\n    fireflies = [(random.randint(0, 250), random.randint(0, 166)) for _ in range(n)]\n    best_solution = max(fireflies, key=lambda f: objective_function(f[0], f[1]))\n    best_fitness = objective_function(best_solution[0], best_solution[1])\n\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if objective_function(fireflies[i][0], fireflies[i][1]) < objective_function(fireflies[j][0], fireflies[j][1]):\n                    dist = distance(fireflies[i], fireflies[j])\n                    beta = attractiveness(beta0, gamma, dist)\n                    fireflies[i] = (fireflies[i][0] + beta * (fireflies[j][0] - fireflies[i][0]) + alpha * (random.random() - 0.5),\n                                    fireflies[i][1] + beta * (fireflies[j][1] - fireflies[i][1]) + alpha * (random.random() - 0.5))\n                    fireflies[i] = (max(0, fireflies[i][0]), max(0, fireflies[i][1]))\n\n        current_best = max(fireflies, key=lambda f: objective_function(f[0], f[1]))\n        current_best_fitness = objective_function(current_best[0], current_best[1])\n\n        if current_best_fitness > best_fitness:\n            best_solution = current_best\n            best_fitness = current_best_fitness\n\n    return best_solution\n\nn = 50\nmax_iter = 100\ngamma = 1.0\nbeta0 = 2.0\nalpha = 0.5\n\noptimal_solution = firefly_algorithm(n, max_iter, gamma, beta0, alpha)\nprint(\"Optimal number of units of P1 and P2 to produce each day:\", optimal_solution)\n```\n\nThis implementation should give you an approximation of the optimal number of units of P1 and P2 to produce each day. Note that the results may vary due to the randomness involved in the algorithm."
