    "message_2": "Apologies for the confusion in my previous responses. Here is the correct solution:\n\nTo find the Fourier transform of the complex function f(x) = e^(ax), where a is a real number, we use the formula:\n\nF(k) = ∫[-∞,∞] e^(-ikx) f(x) dx, where ∫[-∞,∞] represents the integral over the entire real line and k is a real variable.\n\nSubstituting the given function in the above formula, we get\n\nF(k) = ∫[-∞,∞] e^(-ikx) e^(ax) dx\n\n= ∫[-∞,∞] e^((a-ik)x) dx\n\nNow, to solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = (a-ik)x and du = (a-ik)dx. Then, the integral becomes:\n\nF(k) = ∫ e^u du / (a-ik)\n\n= (1/(a-ik)) ∫ e^u du\n\n= (1/(a-ik)) [e^u] from -∞ to ∞\n\nHowever, this integral does not converge for all values of x ∈ R, as e^u will not approach 0 as x approaches ±∞ for all values of a. Therefore, the Fourier transform of the given function f(x) = e^(ax) for all x ∈ R does not exist in the classical sense.\n\nIn some cases, the Fourier transform can be defined using distributions or generalized functions, but that is beyond the scope of this explanation."
