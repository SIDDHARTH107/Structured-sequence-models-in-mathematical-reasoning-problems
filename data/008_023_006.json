If x, y, and z are the true values of the system, find the values of x, y, and z with a tolerance of ±0.2 using the least square method.",
    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using the least squares method, we first need to rewrite the system in matrix form. Let A be the matrix of coefficients, X be the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B be the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |       X = | x |       B = | 10 |\n    | 3  2  5 |           | y |           | 12 |\n    | 4  5  3 |           | z |           | 14 |\n\nThe least squares method aims to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the actual values (B) and the predicted values (AX). To do this, we can use the normal equation:\n\nX = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T * B\n\nwhere A^T is the transpose of A, and (A^T * A)^(-1) is the inverse of the product of A^T and A.\n\nFirst, let's compute A^T:\n\nA^T = | 2  3  4 |\n      | 3  2  5 |\n      | 4  5  3 |\n\nNow, let's compute the product A^T * A:\n\nA^T * A = | 2  3  4 |   | 2  3  4 | = | 29  34  29 |\n          | 3  2  5 | * | 3  2  5 |   | 34  38  39 |\n          | 4  5  3 |   | 4  5  3 |   | 29  39  50 |\n\nNext, let's compute the inverse of A^T * A:\n\n(A^T * A)^(-1) = |  0.245 -0.135 -0.020 |\n                | -0.135  0.115  0.040 |\n                | -0.020  0.040  0.020 |\n\nNow, let's compute the product A^T * B:\n\nA^T * B = | 2  3  4 |   | 10 | = | 104 |\n          | 3  2  5 | * | 12 |   | 110 |\n          | 4  5  3 |   | 14 |   | 126 |\n\nFinally, let's compute the product (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T * B:\n\nX = |  0.245 -0.135 -0.020 |   | 104 | = | 1.000 |\n    | -0.135  0.115  0.040 | * | 110 |   | 2.000 |\n    | -0.020  0.040  0.020 |   | 126 |   | 3.000 |\n\nSo, the least squares solution for the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1.000\ny = 2.000\nz = 3.000\n\nSince the error in the data is ±0.5 and we want a tolerance of ±0.2, the values of x, y, and z are within the acceptable range:\n\nx = 1.000 ± 0.2\ny = 2.000 ± 0.2\nz = 3.000 ± 0.2"
