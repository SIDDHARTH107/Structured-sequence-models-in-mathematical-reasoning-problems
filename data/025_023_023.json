    "message_2": "To compute the intersection cohomology groups of the algebraic variety $X$, we first need to find the Poincaré polynomial of $X$. The Poincaré polynomial is given by\n$$P_X(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim X} b_k(X) t^k,$$\nwhere $b_k(X)$ is the $k$-th Betti number of $X$, which counts the number of independent $k$-cycles in $X$.\n\nThe algebraic variety $X$ is defined by the complex zeros of the polynomial $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xy - 2xz - 2yz - 3$. We can rewrite this polynomial as\n$$f(x,y,z) = (x - y)^2 + (x - z)^2 + (y - z)^2 - 3.$$\n\nNotice that $f(x,y,z) = 0$ if and only if $(x - y)^2 + (x - z)^2 + (y - z)^2 = 3$. This equation defines a smooth quadric surface in $\\mathbb{C}^3$. Since $X$ is a smooth quadric surface, its Poincaré polynomial is given by\n$$P_X(t) = 1 + 3t + 3t^2 + t^3.$$\n\nNow we can compute the intersection cohomology groups $IH^k(X)$ for $k = 0, 1, 2$ using the Poincaré polynomial formula. We have\n$$IH^0(X) = \\mathbb{C}, \\quad IH^1(X) = \\mathbb{C}^3, \\quad IH^2(X) = \\mathbb{C}^3.$$\n\nIn summary, the intersection cohomology groups of the algebraic variety $X$ are given by\n$$IH^0(X) = \\mathbb{C}, \\quad IH^1(X) = \\mathbb{C}^3, \\quad IH^2(X) = \\mathbb{C}^3.$$"
