    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms, Firm A and Firm B, that are competing to sell similar products. Both firms produce an identical product that costs $20 to produce, and there are 100 customers in the market. Firm A decides to sell the product at a price of $35, while Firm B decides to sell the product at a price of $30. Assuming that customers will choose the firm with the lowest price, how many customers will buy from Firm A, and how many will buy from Firm B?",
    "message_2": "Since customers will choose the firm with the lowest price, all 100 customers will buy from Firm B, which sells the product at a price of $30. Therefore, 0 customers will buy from Firm A, which sells the product at a higher price of $35."
