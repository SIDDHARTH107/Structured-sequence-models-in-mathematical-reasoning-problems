Then, apply the Riemann mapping theorem to find a conformal mapping from $\\mathbb{U}$ to $\\mathbb{D}$.",
    "message_2": "First, we use the Cayley transform $f(z) = \\frac{z-i}{z+i}$ to map the right half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ onto the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{U}$. Now, we need to find a conformal mapping from $\\mathbb{U}$ to the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$.\n\nWe can use the exponential function $g(z) = e^{i\\pi z}$ to map the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{U}$ to the right half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$. Then, we can use the MÃ¶bius transformation $h(z) = \\frac{z-1}{z+1}$ to map the right half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ to the unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$.\n\nNow, we can compose these mappings to find the conformal mapping from $\\mathbb{H}$ to $\\mathbb{D}$. Let $F(z) = h(g(f(z)))$. Then,\n\n$$F(z) = h(g(f(z))) = h(g(\\frac{z-i}{z+i})) = h(e^{i\\pi(\\frac{z-i}{z+i})}).$$\n\nTo compute the derivative of $F(z)$ at $z=i$, we first compute the derivatives of $f(z)$, $g(z)$, and $h(z)$:\n\n$$f'(z) = \\frac{2i}{(z+i)^2},$$\n$$g'(z) = i\\pi e^{i\\pi z},$$\n$$h'(z) = \\frac{2}{(z+1)^2}.$$\n\nNow, we can use the chain rule to compute the derivative of $F(z)$ at $z=i$:\n\n$$F'(i) = h'(g(f(i)))g'(f(i))f'(i) = h'(g(\\frac{i-i}{i+i}))g'(\\frac{i-i}{i+i})f'(i) = h'(g(0))g'(0)f'(i) = h'(1)g'(0)f'(i) = \\frac{2}{(1+1)^2}i\\pi e^{i\\pi(0)}\\frac{2i}{(i+i)^2} = \\frac{1}{2}i\\pi(2i) = -\\pi i^2 = \\pi.$$\n\nSo, the conformal mapping from $\\mathbb{H}$ to $\\mathbb{D}$ is given by $F(z) = h(e^{i\\pi(\\frac{z-i}{z+i})})$, and its derivative at $z=i$ is $F'(i) = \\pi$."
