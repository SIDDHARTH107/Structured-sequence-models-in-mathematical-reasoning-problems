    "message_1": "A certain bakery sells cupcakes in 3 flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. How many different combinations of 10 cupcakes can a customer choose if they want at least 3 vanilla, 2 chocolate, and 1 strawberry cupcake? Assume the order of the cupcakes doesn't matter.",
    "message_2": "Let's use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. We have 10 cupcakes, and we need to distribute them among the 3 flavors, with at least 3 vanilla, 2 chocolate, and 1 strawberry.\n\nFirst, we'll give the minimum required cupcakes to each flavor: 3 vanilla, 2 chocolate, and 1 strawberry. This leaves us with 10 - 3 - 2 - 1 = 4 cupcakes left to distribute among the 3 flavors.\n\nNow, we'll use the stars and bars method to distribute these 4 remaining cupcakes. We have 4 stars (representing the cupcakes) and 2 bars (representing the divisions between the flavors). We need to arrange these 6 items (4 stars and 2 bars) in a row.\n\nThere are 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange 6 items, but we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 4 stars and the 2 bars separately, since they are indistinguishable from each other. So, we have:\n\n(6!)/(4! * 2!) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)) = (6 * 5) / 2 = 15\n\nSo there are 15 different combinations of 10 cupcakes that a customer can choose, with at least 3 vanilla, 2 chocolate, and 1 strawberry cupcake."
