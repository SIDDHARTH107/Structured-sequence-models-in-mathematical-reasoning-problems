    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature at a point on the surface of the cylinder, we need to consider the principal curvatures at that point. For a cylinder, one of the principal curvatures is always zero (along the generator), and the other principal curvature is the reciprocal of the radius of the cylinder.\n\nLet k1 and k2 be the principal curvatures. In this case, k1 = 0 (along the generator) and k2 = 1/r, where r is the radius of the cylinder (4 cm).\n\nNow, we are given that the normal vector makes an angle of 45 degrees with the generator. Let θ be the angle between the normal vector and the generator. In this case, θ = 45 degrees.\n\nWe can use the formula for sectional curvature K at a point on the surface with respect to the normal vector:\n\nK = k1 * cos^2(θ) + k2 * sin^2(θ)\n\nSince k1 = 0, the formula simplifies to:\n\nK = k2 * sin^2(θ)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for k2 and θ:\n\nK = (1/4) * sin^2(45)\n\nSince sin(45) = √2 / 2, we have:\n\nK = (1/4) * (1/2)\n\nK = 1/8\n\nSo, the sectional curvature at the given point on the surface of the cylinder is 1/8 cm^(-2)."
