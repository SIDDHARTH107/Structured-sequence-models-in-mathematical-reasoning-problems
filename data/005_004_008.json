    "message_1": "In an ANOVA test comparing three groups, the sum of squares between groups (SSB) is 152.5 and the sum of squares within groups (SSW) is 78.9. Assume the total sample size is 30. Calculate the F-statistic and determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the F-statistic, we first need to find the degrees of freedom for both between groups (dfb) and within groups (dfw). \n\nFor between groups, dfb = k - 1, where k is the number of groups. In this case, k = 3, so dfb = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nFor within groups, dfw = N - k, where N is the total sample size. In this case, N = 30, so dfw = 30 - 3 = 27.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the mean square between groups (MSB) and the mean square within groups (MSW).\n\nMSB = SSB / dfb = 152.5 / 2 = 76.25\nMSW = SSW / dfw = 78.9 / 27 = 2.92\n\nNow, we can calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW = 76.25 / 2.92 = 26.12\n\nTo determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05, we need to compare the calculated F-statistic to the critical F-value. We can find the critical F-value using an F-distribution table or an online calculator, with dfb = 2 and dfw = 27.\n\nLooking up the critical F-value for a 0.05 significance level, we find that F(2, 27) = 3.35.\n\nSince our calculated F-statistic (26.12) is greater than the critical F-value (3.35), we reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05. This means that there is a significant difference between the means of the three groups."
