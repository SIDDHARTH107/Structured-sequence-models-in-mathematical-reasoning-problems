    "message_1": "In a volunteer organization, there are 10 members who need to contribute $100 each for a charity event. Each member has a 50% chance of actually contributing the money. However, if less than 8 members contribute, the event will not take place and all the money will be refunded. What is the probability that the event will take place and the charity will receive $1000?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the event will take place, we need to find the probability that at least 8 members contribute. We can do this by calculating the probabilities of exactly 8, 9, and 10 members contributing and then summing these probabilities.\n\nThe probability of a member contributing is 0.5, and the probability of a member not contributing is also 0.5. We can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of exactly k members contributing:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the total number of members (10), k is the number of contributing members, p is the probability of a member contributing (0.5), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\n1. Probability of exactly 8 members contributing:\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.5^8 * 0.5^2 = 45 * 0.00390625 * 0.25 = 0.0439453125\n\n2. Probability of exactly 9 members contributing:\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.5^9 * 0.5^1 = 10 * 0.001953125 * 0.5 = 0.009765625\n\n3. Probability of exactly 10 members contributing:\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.5^10 * 0.5^0 = 1 * 0.0009765625 * 1 = 0.0009765625\n\nNow, we sum these probabilities to find the probability of at least 8 members contributing:\n\nP(X â‰¥ 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) = 0.0439453125 + 0.009765625 + 0.0009765625 = 0.0546875\n\nSo, the probability that the event will take place and the charity will receive $1000 is 0.0546875 or 5.46875%."
