    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of length 8 cm and a height of length 10 cm. Use Trigonometry to find the area of the triangle, rounded to the nearest tenth of a square centimeter.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a right triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 8 * 10\nArea = 4 * 10\nArea = 40 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 40.0 square centimeters, rounded to the nearest tenth."
