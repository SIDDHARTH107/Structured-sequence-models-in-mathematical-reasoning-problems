    "message_1": "A school has 400 students, out of which 300 took a mathematics test. If the probability of a student passing the math test is 0.75, what is the probability that exactly 225 students passed the test?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (students passing the test) out of n trials (students taking the test)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes out of n trials, which can be calculated as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of a single success (student passing the test)\n- n is the number of trials (students taking the test)\n- k is the number of successes (students passing the test)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 300 (students who took the test)\n- k = 225 (students who passed the test)\n- p = 0.75 (probability of a student passing the test)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 225) = C(300, 225) * 0.75^225 * (1-0.75)^(300-225)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(300, 225):\n\nC(300, 225) = 300! / (225!(300-225)!)\nC(300, 225) = 300! / (225!75!)\n\nNow, let's calculate 0.75^225 and (1-0.75)^(300-225):\n\n0.75^225 ≈ 1.07 * 10^(-16)\n(1-0.75)^(300-225) = 0.25^75 ≈ 8.88 * 10^(-46)\n\nNow, we can multiply these values together:\n\nP(X = 225) ≈ (C(300, 225)) * (1.07 * 10^(-16)) * (8.88 * 10^(-46))\n\nTo find the exact value of C(300, 225), we can use a calculator or software that can handle large factorials. Using a calculator, we find:\n\nC(300, 225) ≈ 1.93 * 10^80\n\nNow, we can multiply all the values together:\n\nP(X = 225) ≈ (1.93 * 10^80) * (1.07 * 10^(-16)) * (8.88 * 10^(-46))\nP(X = 225) ≈ 1.83 * 10^(80-16-46)\nP(X = 225) ≈ 1.83 * 10^18\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 225 students passed the test is approximately 1.83 * 10^18."
