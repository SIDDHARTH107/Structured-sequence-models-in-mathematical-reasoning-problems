    "message_1": "In a population of 10,000 individuals, it is known that 5% have a specific medical condition. If a doctor diagnoses a patient at random from this population, what is the probability that the patient has the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "If 5% of the 10,000 individuals have the medical condition, then there are 0.05 * 10,000 = 500 individuals with the condition. If a doctor diagnoses a patient at random, the probability that the patient has the medical condition is the number of individuals with the condition divided by the total population. Therefore, the probability is 500 / 10,000 = 0.05 or 5%."
