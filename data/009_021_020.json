    "message_1": "A partial differential equation governing the heat diffusion in an image is given by:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 u$\n\nwhere $u(x,y,t)$ is the temperature at position $(x,y)$ and time $t$, $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nSuppose an image of size $256 \\times 256$ is taken with a resolution of $0.1$ units in both $x$ and $y$ directions. The image is heated to $100$ degrees at its center ($x=128,\\ y=128$) and remains at a constant temperature of $0$ degrees at its boundaries. If the diffusion coefficient is $0.1$, what is the temperature distribution in the image after $10$ minutes of heating?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the finite difference method to approximate the solution of the partial differential equation (PDE). We will discretize the spatial domain using a grid of size $256 \\times 256$ with a resolution of $0.1$ units in both $x$ and $y$ directions. We will also discretize the time domain using a time step $\\Delta t$.\n\nFirst, let's approximate the Laplacian operator using the central difference method:\n\n$\\nabla^2 u(x, y) \\approx \\frac{u(x + \\Delta x, y) - 2u(x, y) + u(x - \\Delta x, y)}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{u(x, y + \\Delta y) - 2u(x, y) + u(x, y - \\Delta y)}{(\\Delta y)^2}$\n\nSince $\\Delta x = \\Delta y = 0.1$, we have:\n\n$\\nabla^2 u(x, y) \\approx \\frac{u(x + 0.1, y) - 2u(x, y) + u(x - 0.1, y)}{0.01} + \\frac{u(x, y + 0.1) - 2u(x, y) + u(x, y - 0.1)}{0.01}$\n\nNow, let's approximate the time derivative using the forward difference method:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{u(x, y, t + \\Delta t) - u(x, y, t)}{\\Delta t}$\n\nSubstituting the approximations into the PDE, we get:\n\n$\\frac{u(x, y, t + \\Delta t) - u(x, y, t)}{\\Delta t} = D \\left(\\frac{u(x + 0.1, y) - 2u(x, y) + u(x - 0.1, y)}{0.01} + \\frac{u(x, y + 0.1) - 2u(x, y) + u(x, y - 0.1)}{0.01}\\right)$\n\nWe want to find the temperature distribution after $10$ minutes, so we need to choose an appropriate time step $\\Delta t$ and iterate the above equation until $t = 10$ minutes. Note that the stability of the finite difference method depends on the choice of $\\Delta t$. A commonly used criterion for stability is the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which states that:\n\n$\\Delta t \\le \\frac{1}{2D} \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2}$\n\nFor our problem, $D = 0.1$ and $\\Delta x = 0.1$, so the CFL condition is:\n\n$\\Delta t \\le \\frac{1}{2(0.1)} \\frac{(0.1)^2}{2} = 0.025$\n\nWe can choose $\\Delta t = 0.025$ to ensure stability. Now, we can iterate the finite difference equation until $t = 10$ minutes, which corresponds to $24000$ time steps.\n\nThe initial condition is given by:\n\n$u(x, y, 0) = \\begin{cases} 100, & \\text{if } x = 128 \\text{ and } y = 128 \\\\ 0, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$\n\nThe boundary conditions are given by:\n\n$u(0, y, t) = u(255, y, t) = u(x, 0, t) = u(x, 255, t) = 0$\n\nUsing the initial and boundary conditions, we can iterate the finite difference equation to find the temperature distribution at $t = 10$ minutes. Note that this is a numerical solution, and the exact temperature distribution can only be obtained by solving the PDE analytically."
