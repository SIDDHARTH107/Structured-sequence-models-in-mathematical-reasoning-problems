    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A Δ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3, 4})\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A Δ B) Δ A and A Δ (B Δ A).\n\n1.

This demonstrates that the symmetric difference of two sets is associative."
