    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is defined by the iterative equation:\n\nZₙ₊₁ = Zₙ² + C\n\nwhere Zₙ and C are complex numbers, Z₀ = 0, and C is the point in the complex plane we are testing. A point is considered to be in the Mandelbrot set if the absolute value of Zₙ does not exceed a certain threshold (usually 2) after a certain number of iterations.\n\nLet's test the point (-0.74543, 0.11301) to see when it escapes the Mandelbrot set:\n\nC = -0.74543 + 0.11301i\n\nZ₀ = 0\n\nZ₁ = Z₀² + C = (-0.74543 + 0.11301i)\n\nZ₂ = Z₁² + C = (-0.74543 + 0.11301i)² + (-0.74543 + 0.11301i) = -0.10262 + 0.16652i\n\nZ₃ = Z₂² + C = (-0.10262 + 0.16652i)² + (-0.74543 + 0.11301i) = -0.65977 + 0.24056i\n\nZ₄ = Z₃² + C = (-0.65977 + 0.24056i)² + (-0.74543 + 0.11301i) = -0.54265 - 0.00892i\n\nZ₅ = Z₄² + C = (-0.54265 - 0.00892i)² + (-0.74543 + 0.11301i) = -0.69252 + 0.10661i\n\nNow, let's check the absolute value of Z₅:\n\n|Z₅| = √((-0.69252)² + (0.10661)²) = √(0.47988 + 0.01136) = √(0.49124)\n\nSince |Z₅| < 2, we need to continue iterating:\n\nZ₆ = Z₅² + C = (-0.69252 + 0.10661i)² + (-0.74543 + 0.11301i) = -0.72569 + 0.12647i\n\n|Z₆| = √((-0.72569)² + (0.12647)²) = √(0.52675 + 0.01599) = √(0.54274)\n\nZ₇ = Z₆² + C = (-0.72569 + 0.12647i)² + (-0.74543 + 0.11301i) = -0.73890 + 0.11697i\n\n|Z₇| = √((-0.73890)² + (0.11697)²) = √(0.54591 + 0.01369) = √(0.55960)\n\nSince the absolute value of Z₇ is still less than 2, we need to continue iterating. However, it's important to note that the Mandelbrot set is typically tested up to a certain maximum number of iterations (e.g., 1000) to determine if a point is in the set or not. If the point doesn't escape after the maximum number of iterations, it is considered to be in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nIn this case, we have only performed 7 iterations, and the point has not yet escaped. To determine the exact iteration count at which the point escapes, we would need to continue iterating until the absolute value of Zₙ exceeds 2 or we reach the maximum number of iterations."
