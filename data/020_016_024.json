Using topological optimization, determine the shape of the drilled hole that maximizes the remaining volume.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the volume of the cube and the volume of the cylindrical hole.\n\nThe volume of the cube is given by the formula V_cube = a^3, where a is the side length of the cube. In this case, a = 10 units.\n\nV_cube = 10^3 = 1000 cubic units\n\nNow, let's find the volume of the cylindrical hole. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V_cylinder = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. In this case, r = 2 units and h = 10 units (since the hole goes through the entire cube).\n\nV_cylinder = π(2^2)(10) = 40π cubic units\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the remaining solid material by subtracting the volume of the cylindrical hole from the volume of the cube:\n\nV_remaining = V_cube - V_cylinder = 1000 - 40π ≈ 1000 - 125.66 = 874.34 cubic units\n\nNow, let's consider the topological optimization problem. The goal is to maximize the remaining volume by changing the shape of the drilled hole. Since the hole goes through the entire cube, the height of the hole will always be 10 units. The shape that maximizes the remaining volume will minimize the volume of the hole while maintaining the same height.\n\nThe shape that minimizes the volume of the hole for a given height is a cylinder with the smallest possible radius. However, the problem states that the radius of the hole is 2 units. Therefore, the shape of the drilled hole that maximizes the remaining volume is already a cylinder with a radius of 2 units and a height of 10 units, as given in the problem.\n\nSo, the maximum volume of the remaining solid material is 874.34 cubic units, and the shape of the drilled hole that maximizes the remaining volume is a cylinder with a radius of 2 units and a height of 10 units."
