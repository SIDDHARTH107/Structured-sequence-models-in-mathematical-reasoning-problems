The distance between each location is given in the following table:\n\n| Location  | A    | B    | C    | D    | E    | F    |\n|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| A         | 0    | 10   | 20   | 15   | 30   | 25   |\n| B         | 10   | 0    | 25   | 20   | 35   | 15   |\n| C         | 20   | 25   | 0    | 10   | 20   | 30   |\n| D         | 15   | 20   | 10   | 0    | 35   | 25   |\n| E         | 30   | 35   | 20   | 35   | 0    | 10   |\n| F         | 25   | 15   | 30   | 25   | 10   | 0    |\n\nThe delivery company wants to find the optimal route to deliver all packages starting and ending at location A. What is the minimum distance the delivery company needs to travel to complete their deliveries?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we can use the traveling salesman problem approach. We need to find the shortest possible route that visits each location exactly once and returns to the starting point, location A.\n\nWe can use brute force to find all possible permutations of the locations (excluding A) and calculate the total distance for each permutation. Then, we can find the minimum distance among all the permutations.\n\nHere are all the permutations of locations B, C, D, E, and F:\n\n1. B-C-D-E-F\n2. B-C-D-F-E\n3. B-C-E-D-F\n4. B-C-E-F-D\n5. B-C-F-D-E\n6. B-C-F-E-D\n...\n119. F-E-D-C-B\n120. F-E-D-B-C\n\nNow, we calculate the total distance for each permutation, including the distance from A to the first location and the distance from the last location back to A.\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-F-A: 10+25+10+35+10+25 = 115\n2. A-B-C-D-F-E-A: 10+25+10+25+10+30 = 110\n3. A-B-C-E-D-F-A: 10+25+20+35+25+25 = 140\n4. A-B-C-E-F-D-A: 10+25+20+10+10+15 = 100\n5. A-B-C-F-D-E-A: 10+25+30+10+35+30 = 140\n6. A-B-C-F-E-D-A: 10+25+30+10+20+15 = 110\n...\n119. A-F-E-D-C-B-A: 25+10+35+10+25+10 = 115\n120. A-F-E-D-B-C-A: 25+10+35+20+25+20 = 135\n\nThe minimum distance among all the permutations is 100, which corresponds to the route A-B-C-E-F-D-A. Therefore, the delivery company needs to travel a minimum distance of 100 units to complete their deliveries."
