He takes a random sample of 50 students and finds the sample mean height to be 170 cm with a sample standard deviation of 8 cm. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean height of students in the school.",
    "message_2": "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true mean height of students in the school, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Sample Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 170 cm, the sample standard deviation is 8 cm, and the sample size is 50 students. The critical value for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 1.96 (based on the standard normal distribution).\n\nConfidence Interval = 170 ± (1.96 * (8 / √50))\n\nFirst, calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 8 / √50 ≈ 1.131\n\nNow, calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 1.131 ≈ 2.218\n\nFinally, calculate the confidence interval:\n\nLower Bound = 170 - 2.218 ≈ 167.782\nUpper Bound = 170 + 2.218 ≈ 172.218\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean height of students in the school is approximately (167.782 cm, 172.218 cm)."
