    "message_2": "Since the given variety is defined over the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$, there are infinitely many $\\mathbb{C}$-rational points on $A$. This is because the complex numbers form an algebraically closed field, which means that every non-constant polynomial equation with coefficients in $\\mathbb{C}$ has a solution in $\\mathbb{C}$. In particular, for any $x \\in \\mathbb{C}$, the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 1$ has a solution for $y$ in $\\mathbb{C}$."
