    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C36, A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, we will analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems.\n\nThe order of G is 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups (n_2) must divide 3^2 = 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups (n_3) must divide 2^2 = 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are coprime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3, which is a cyclic group of order 36. Thus, G is isomorphic to C36 in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4, which is normal in G. However, there are four 3-Sylow subgroups, and none of them are normal in G. Let P_3 be one of these 3-Sylow subgroups. Since P_2 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product P_3 ⋊ P_2. The isomorphism type of this semidirect product depends on the action of P_2 on P_3. Since P_2 has order 4, it can be isomorphic to either C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). If P_2 is isomorphic to C4, there are two possible actions on P_3, leading to two non-abelian groups of order 36. If P_2 is isomorphic to V4, there are three possible actions on P_3, leading to three non-abelian groups of order 36. In total, there are five non-abelian groups of order 36 in this case.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, with the roles of the 2-Sylow and 3-Sylow subgroups reversed. Thus, there are also five non-abelian groups of order 36 in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3 (which is one of the non-abelian groups in Case 2), or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36 (five in Case 2 and four in Case 3). To determine the specific isomorphism type of G, more information about the group structure or a specific presentation of G would be needed."
