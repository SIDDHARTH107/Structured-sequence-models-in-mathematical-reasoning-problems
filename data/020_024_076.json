    "message_1": "A company produces and sells a certain product at a fixed cost of $20, and the demand function for the product is given by: \n\nQ = 1000 - 10P \n\nwhere Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price per unit. \n\nWhat is the optimal price for the company to maximize their revenue?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal price to maximize revenue, we need to find the price at which the revenue function R(P) is maximized. Revenue is the product of price and quantity, so we can write the revenue function as:\n\nR(P) = P * Q\n\nSubstitute the demand function Q = 1000 - 10P into the revenue function:\n\nR(P) = P * (1000 - 10P)\n\nR(P) = 1000P - 10P^2\n\nTo find the maximum revenue, we need to find the critical points of the revenue function by taking the derivative with respect to P and setting it to zero:\n\ndR(P)/dP = 1000 - 20P = 0\n\nSolve for P:\n\n20P = 1000\nP = 50\n\nSo, the optimal price to maximize revenue is $50 per unit."
