    "message_2": "To find the probability that a person attends either a sports or performing arts event, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nHere, A represents attending a sports event, and B represents attending a performing arts event. We are given P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.3. However, we don't have the information about the probability of attending both events, P(A ∩ B).\n\nWithout knowing the probability of attending both events, we cannot find the exact probability of attending either a sports or performing arts event."
