    "message_2": "To determine whether the sequence $(S_n)$ converges or diverges, we need to examine the limit of the sequence as $n$ goes to infinity. In a topological space, a sequence of sets $(S_n)$ converges to a set $S$ if for every open neighborhood $U$ of $S$, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, $S_n \\subseteq U$.\n\nIn this case, the sequence $(S_n)$ is given by $S_n = \\{1, 2, 3, ..., n\\}$. As $n$ goes to infinity, the set $S_n$ includes all positive integers. Therefore, the limit of the sequence is the set of all positive integers, which we can denote as $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nNow, let's check if the sequence converges to $\\mathbb{N}$. Let $U$ be an open neighborhood of $\\mathbb{N}$. Since $U$ is an open set containing all positive integers, for any positive integer $k$, there exists an open set $U_k$ containing $k$ such that $U_k \\subseteq U$. Let $N = \\max\\{k: k \\in U_k\\}$. Then, for all $n \\geq N$, $S_n \\subseteq U$.\n\nTherefore, the sequence $(S_n)$ converges, and its limit is the set of all positive integers, $\\mathbb{N}$."
