    "message_2": "To show that there exists a non-vanishing smooth differential n-form on M if and only if M is orientable, we will prove both directions of the statement.\n\n(⇒) Suppose there exists a non-vanishing smooth differential n-form ω on M. We want to show that M is orientable. Recall that a manifold M is orientable if and only if it admits a smooth atlas {(U_i, φ_i)} such that the Jacobian determinant of the transition functions is positive, i.e., det(∂(φ_i ◦ φ_j^(-1))/∂x) > 0 for all overlapping charts (U_i, φ_i) and (U_j, φ_j).\n\nLet (U, φ) be a chart on M. Since ω is non-vanishing, we have that ω_p ≠ 0 for all p ∈ M. In particular, ω|_U ≠ 0. Now, let ω|_U = f dx^1 ∧ ... ∧ dx^n, where f is a smooth function on U. Since ω|_U ≠ 0, we have that f(p) ≠ 0 for all p ∈ U.\n\nNow, let (V, ψ) be another chart on M such that U ∩ V ≠ ∅. We want to show that the Jacobian determinant of the transition function is positive. Let x = φ(p) and y = ψ(p) for some p ∈ U ∩ V. Then, we have the transition function g: φ(U ∩ V) → ψ(U ∩ V) given by g(x) = ψ ◦ φ^(-1)(x). We want to compute the Jacobian determinant det(∂g/∂x).\n\nConsider the pullback (ψ^*ω)|_U = (ψ^*ω)|_(U ∩ V) = g^*f dy^1 ∧ ... ∧ dy^n, where g^*f is the pullback of f by the transition function g. Since ω is smooth and non-vanishing, g^*f is also smooth and non-vanishing on φ(U ∩ V). Now, we have:\n\n(ψ^*ω)|_U = φ^*ω|_U = φ^*(f dx^1 ∧ ... ∧ dx^n) = (φ^*f) (φ^*dx^1 ∧ ... ∧ φ^*dx^n).\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of the basis elements dy^1 ∧ ... ∧ dy^n and dx^1 ∧ ... ∧ dx^n, we get:\n\ng^*f = φ^*f det(∂g/∂x).\n\nSince g^*f and φ^*f are both non-vanishing, it follows that det(∂g/∂x) > 0. Thus, M is orientable.\n\n(⇐) Suppose M is orientable. We want to show that there exists a non-vanishing smooth differential n-form on M. Since M is orientable, there exists an atlas {(U_i, φ_i)} such that the Jacobian determinant of the transition functions is positive. We can construct a smooth partition of unity {ρ_i} subordinate to the cover {U_i}.\n\nNow, let ω_i = ρ_i dx^1_i ∧ ... ∧ dx^n_i be a smooth differential n-form on U_i, where (x^1_i, ..., x^n_i) are the local coordinates on U_i given by φ_i. We define a global differential n-form ω on M by ω = ∑ ω_i. We want to show that ω is non-vanishing.\n\nLet p ∈ M. Then, p ∈ U_i for some i. Since ρ_i(p) > 0 and ω_i(p) ≠ 0, it follows that ω(p) ≠ 0. Thus, ω is a non-vanishing smooth differential n-form on M.\n\nIn conclusion, there exists a non-vanishing smooth differential n-form on M if and only if M is orientable."
