In other words, the k-th Betti number b_k is the rank of H^k(X, Z). \n\nFor the given cohomology groups H^k(X, Z), we can compute the Betti numbers as follows:\n\n1. H^0(X, Z) = Z: Since Z is the group of integers, its rank is 1. Therefore, b_0 = 1.\n\n2. H^1(X, Z) = Z/4Z: This is a cyclic group of order 4, which is a finite group. The rank of a finite abelian group is 0. Therefore, b_1 = 0.\n\n3. H^2(X, Z) = Z/2Z: This is a cyclic group of order 2, which is also a finite group. The rank of a finite abelian group is 0. Therefore, b_2 = 0.\n\nSo, the Betti numbers of X are b_0 = 1, b_1 = 0, and b_2 = 0."
