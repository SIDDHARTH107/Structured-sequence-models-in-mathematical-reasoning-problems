    "message_1": "A 20-meter long ladder leans against a tree. The bottom of the ladder is placed 5 meters away from the base of the tree. What is the angle of elevation of the ladder?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation of the ladder, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. Let's denote the angle of elevation as θ.\n\nWe are given the length of the ladder (the hypotenuse) as 20 meters, and the distance from the base of the tree to the bottom of the ladder (the adjacent side) as 5 meters. We need to find the height of the ladder where it touches the tree (the opposite side). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find this:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\nwhere a is the adjacent side (5 meters), b is the opposite side (height), and c is the hypotenuse (20 meters).\n\n5^2 + b^2 = 20^2\n25 + b^2 = 400\nb^2 = 375\nb = √375\nb ≈ 19.36 meters\n\nNow that we have the height of the ladder, we can use the tangent function to find the angle of elevation:\n\ntan(θ) = opposite/adjacent\ntan(θ) = 19.36/5\ntan(θ) ≈ 3.872\n\nTo find the angle θ, we take the inverse tangent (arctangent) of 3.872:\n\nθ = arctan(3.872)\nθ ≈ 75.96 degrees\n\nThe angle of elevation of the ladder is approximately 75.96 degrees."
