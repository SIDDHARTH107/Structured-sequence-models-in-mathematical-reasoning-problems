    "message_2": "To find the number of different connected graphs with 4 vertices, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of possible edges in a graph with 4 vertices: For a graph with n vertices, there can be a maximum of n(n-1)/2 edges. So for a graph with 4 vertices, there can be a maximum of 4(4-1)/2 = 6 edges.\n\n2. Calculate the number of connected graphs for each possible number of edges: A connected graph with 4 vertices must have at least 3 edges (forming a tree) and at most 6 edges (forming a complete graph).\n\n- For 3 edges: There is only 1 connected graph, which is a tree (a graph with no cycles) with 4 vertices.\n- For 4 edges: There are 2 connected graphs: one with a cycle of length 3 and one with a cycle of length 4.\n- For 5 edges: There is only 1 connected graph, which is a complete graph with one edge removed.\n- For 6 edges: There is only 1 connected graph, which is a complete graph with all 6 edges.\n\n3. Add up the number of connected graphs for each possible number of edges: 1 (for 3 edges) + 2 (for 4 edges) + 1 (for 5 edges) + 1 (for 6 edges) = 5.\n\nSo there are 5 different connected graphs with 4 vertices."
