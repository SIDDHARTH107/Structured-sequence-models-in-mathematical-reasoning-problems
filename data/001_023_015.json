    "message_2": "To solve the equation cos(2x) = 1/2 for x within the range 0° ≤ x ≤ 360°, we first need to find the angles for which the cosine function equals 1/2. \n\nRecall that the cosine function has a value of 1/2 at angles 60° and 300° (in the first and fourth quadrants). So, we have:\n\n2x = 60° or 2x = 300°\n\nNow, we can solve for x in each case:\n\nCase 1: 2x = 60°\nx = 60°/2\nx = 30°\n\nCase 2: 2x = 300°\nx = 300°/2\nx = 150°\n\nSo, the solutions for x within the given range are x = 30° and x = 150°."
