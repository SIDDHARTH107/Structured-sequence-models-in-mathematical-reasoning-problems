    "message_2": "To calculate the definite integral of the function f(x) = 2cos(3x) within the bounds 0 and π/3, we first need to find the antiderivative of the function and then evaluate it at the given bounds.\n\nThe antiderivative of 2cos(3x) with respect to x can be found using the substitution method. Let u = 3x, then du/dx = 3, and dx = du/3.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n∫2cos(3x) dx = ∫2cos(u) (du/3)\n\nNow, we can find the antiderivative:\n\n(2/3)∫cos(u) du = (2/3)sin(u) + C\n\nNow, we substitute back for x:\n\n(2/3)sin(3x) + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integral within the bounds 0 and π/3:\n\n[(2/3)sin(3(π/3)) - (2/3)sin(3(0))]\n\n= [(2/3)sin(π) - (2/3)sin(0)]\n\n= [(2/3)(0) - (2/3)(0)]\n\n= 0\n\nSo, the definite integral of the function f(x) = 2cos(3x) within the bounds 0 and π/3 is 0."
