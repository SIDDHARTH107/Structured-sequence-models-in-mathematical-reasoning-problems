    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation $2x^3 - 5x^2 + x + 3 = 0$, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The theorem states that if a rational number $\\frac{p}{q}$ is a root of the polynomial, then $p$ must be a factor of the constant term (in this case, 3) and $q$ must be a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 2).\n\nThe factors of 3 are ±1, ±3, and the factors of 2 are ±1, ±2. So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±3, ±1/2, and ±3/2.\n\nWe can test these roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\n1. $2(1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 1 + 3 = 1 - 5 + 1 + 3 = 0$, so $x = 1$ is a root.\n\nNow that we have found a root, we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n```\n  1 |  2  -5   1   3\n    |     2  -3  -2\n    |--------------\n      2  -3  -2   1\n```\n\nThis gives us the quadratic factor $2x^2 - 3x - 2$. Now we can solve the quadratic equation:\n\n$2x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, $\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n\n$x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(2)(-2)}}{2(2)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{4}$\n\n$x = \\frac{3 \\pm 5}{4}$\n\nSo, the two other roots are:\n\n$x = \\frac{3 + 5}{4} = 2$\n\n$x = \\frac{3 - 5}{4} = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThus, the solutions to the polynomial equation $2x^3 - 5x^2 + x + 3 = 0$ are $x = 1, x = 2,$ and $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$."
