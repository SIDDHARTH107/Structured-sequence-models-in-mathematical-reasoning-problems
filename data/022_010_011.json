    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = 1/[(z-1)(z-2)] centered at z = 1, we first rewrite the function using partial fraction decomposition:\n\nf(z) = A/(z-1) + B/(z-2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (z-1)(z-2) to clear the denominators, we get:\n\n1 = A(z-2) + B(z-1)\n\nNow we can solve for A and B by plugging in values of z that make one of the terms on the right-hand side equal to zero:\n\nFor z = 1, we get:\n\n1 = A(1-2) + B(1-1) => A = -1\n\nFor z = 2, we get:\n\n1 = A(2-2) + B(2-1) => B = 1\n\nSo, f(z) = -1/(z-1) + 1/(z-2)\n\nNow we can find the Laurent series expansion for each term separately. For the first term, we have:\n\n-1/(z-1) = -1/(1 - (1-z)) = -1 * Σ (1-z)^n = -Σ (1-z)^n\n\nFor the second term, we have:\n\n1/(z-2) = 1/(1 - (3-z)) = 1 * Σ (3-z)^n = Σ (3-z)^n\n\nAdding these two series together, we get the Laurent series expansion for f(z):\n\nf(z) = Σ [-(1-z)^n + (3-z)^n]\n\nThe series converges for values of z such that the absolute value of the terms inside the summation are less than 1:\n\n|1-z| < 1 => 0 < z < 2\n|3-z| < 1 => 2 < z < 4\n\nThus, the Laurent series converges for z in the range (0, 2) ∪ (2, 4)."
