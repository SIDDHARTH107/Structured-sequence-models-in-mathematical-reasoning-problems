    "message_2": "Cauchy's theorem states that if a function is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on a closed contour C, then the integral of the function around the contour is zero. \n\nThe function $f(z) = z^3 + 4z - 2$ is a polynomial, and polynomials are analytic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, the function is analytic inside and on the contour C.\n\nApplying Cauchy's theorem, we have:\n\n$$\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz = 0$$\n\nSo, the integral of $f(z)$ around the contour $C$ is 0."
