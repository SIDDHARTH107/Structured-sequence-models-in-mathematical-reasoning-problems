    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of the cone, we need to find the area of the base (a circle) and the area of the lateral surface (a sector of a circle).\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the base:\nBase area (A_base) = π * r^2\nA_base = π * (5 cm)^2\nA_base = 25π cm^2\n\nNext, let's find the area of the lateral surface:\nLateral surface area (A_lateral) = 1/2 * Circumference of the base * Slant height\nCircumference of the base = 2 * π * r\nCircumference = 2 * π * 5 cm = 10π cm\n\nA_lateral = 1/2 * (10π cm) * (12 cm)\nA_lateral = 60π cm^2\n\nNow, let's find the total surface area:\nTotal surface area (A_total) = A_base + A_lateral\nA_total = 25π cm^2 + 60π cm^2\nA_total = 85π cm^2\n\nThe total surface area of the cone is 85π cm^2."
