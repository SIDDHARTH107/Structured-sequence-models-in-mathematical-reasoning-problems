    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |      x = | x |      b = | 14 |\n    | 2  1  2 |          | y |          | 10 |\n    | 3  2  1 |          | z |          | 12 |\n\nNow, we perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process where matrix A is decomposed into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition calculator or software (e.g., MATLAB, Python, etc.), we find:\n\nQ = | -0.27  -0.80  0.53 |\n    | -0.53   0.60  0.60 |\n    | -0.80  -0.13 -0.58 |\n\nR = | -3.74 -2.16 -1.60 |\n    |  0   -1.60 -2.37 |\n    |  0     0    1.16 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation Rx = Q^Tb, where Q^T is the transpose of matrix Q.\n\nFirst, we calculate Q^Tb:\n\nQ^Tb = | -0.27  -0.53  -0.80 | | 14 |\n       | -0.80   0.60  -0.13 | | 10 |\n       |  0.53   0.60  -0.58 | | 12 |\n\nQ^Tb = | -2.96 |\n       | -8.00 |\n       |  3.48 |\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\nRx = | -3.74 -2.16 -1.60 | | x |   | -2.96 |\n    |  0   -1.60 -2.37 | | y | = | -8.00 |\n    |  0     0    1.16 | | z |   |  3.48 |\n\nWe can solve this system using back substitution:\n\nz = 3.48 / 1.16 = 3.00\n\ny = (-8.00 + 2.37 * 3.00) / -1.60 = 2.00\n\nx = (-2.96 + 2.16 * 2.00 + 1.60 * 3.00) / -3.74 = 1.00\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.00, y = 2.00, and z = 3.00, rounded to two decimal places."
