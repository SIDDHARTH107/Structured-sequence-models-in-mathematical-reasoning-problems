    "message_2": "To find the rank of the matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the matrix. \n\nMatrix A:\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3\\\\\n2 & 4 & 6\\\\\n3 & 6 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, the matrix is in row echelon form. The rank of a matrix is the number of non-zero rows in its row echelon form. In this case, there is only 1 non-zero row.\n\nTherefore, the rank of matrix A is 1."
