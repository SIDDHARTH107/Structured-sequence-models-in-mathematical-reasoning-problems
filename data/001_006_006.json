    "message_2": "To find the vertex and axis of symmetry of the quadratic equation y = x^2 + 4x + 3, we first need to rewrite the equation in vertex form. The vertex form of a quadratic equation is given by:\n\ny = a(x - h)^2 + k\n\nwhere (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola and a is a constant.\n\nTo rewrite the given equation in vertex form, we need to complete the square:\n\ny = x^2 + 4x + 3\n\nFirst, we find the value needed to complete the square. We take half of the coefficient of the x term (4) and square it:\n\n(4/2)^2 = 2^2 = 4\n\nNow, we add and subtract this value inside the parentheses:\n\ny = (x^2 + 4x + 4) - 4 + 3\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in vertex form:\n\ny = (x + 2)^2 - 1\n\nNow, we can identify the vertex (h, k) as (-2, -1). The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, so its equation is:\n\nx = -2"
