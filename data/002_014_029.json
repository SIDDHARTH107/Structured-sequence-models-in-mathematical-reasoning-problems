    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 7 meters, a width of 4 meters, and a height of 5 meters. What is the total surface area (in square meters) of this rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSurface Area = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: l = 7 meters, w = 4 meters, and h = 5 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2(7)(4) + 2(7)(5) + 2(4)(5)\nSurface Area = 56 + 70 + 40\nSurface Area = 166 square meters\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 166 square meters."
