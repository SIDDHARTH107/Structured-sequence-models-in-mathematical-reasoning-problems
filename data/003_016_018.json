    "message_2": "The given function is y = 4sin(3x - π/4). To find the phase shift, we need to look at the argument of the sine function, which is (3x - π/4) in this case.\n\nThe general form of a sine function with phase shift is y = A*sin(B(x - C)), where A is the amplitude, B is the frequency, and C is the phase shift.\n\nComparing the given function with the general form, we have:\n\nA = 4, B = 3, and (x - C) = (x - π/4)\n\nNow, we can find the phase shift C:\n\nx - C = x - π/4\nC = π/4\n\nSo, the phase shift of the function y = 4sin(3x - π/4) is π/4."
