    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  5]\n[ 2 -3  4 |  7]\n[-6  7 -5 | -1]\n\nNow, we'll perform forward elimination to convert the matrix into an upper triangular matrix.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo eliminate x from the second row, we'll subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  5]\n[ 0 -7  6 | -3]\n[-6  7 -5 | -1]\n\nTo eliminate x from the third row, we'll add 6 times the first row to the third row:\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  5]\n[ 0 -7  6 | -3]\n[ 0  5 -1 | 29]\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo eliminate y from the third row, we'll add (5/7) times the second row to the third row:\n\n[ 1  2 -1 |  5]\n[ 0 -7  6 | -3]\n[ 0  0  1 |  4]\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 3: Back substitution\n\nFrom the third row, we have z = 4.\n\nNow, we'll substitute z into the second row to find y:\n\n-7y + 6(4) = -3\n-7y + 24 = -3\n-7y = -27\ny = 27/7\n\nFinally, we'll substitute y and z into the first row to find x:\n\nx + 2(27/7) - 4 = 5\nx + 54/7 - 4 = 5\nx = 5 - 54/7 + 4\nx = (35 - 54 + 28)/7\nx = 9/7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 9/7\ny = 27/7\nz = 4"
