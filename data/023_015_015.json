    "message_2": "To find the Fourier Series coefficients for each of the three waveforms, we need to compute the Fourier transform of the given audio signal. Let's denote the audio signal as f(t), which is a sum of three different waveforms with frequencies of 100 Hz, 300 Hz, and 500 Hz. We can represent f(t) as:\n\nf(t) = A1 * sin(2π * 100 * t) + A2 * sin(2π * 300 * t) + A3 * sin(2π * 500 * t)\n\nwhere A1, A2, and A3 are the amplitudes of the three waveforms.\n\nThe Fourier transform of f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nWe need to find the Fourier coefficients for each of the three waveforms, which correspond to the amplitudes A1, A2, and A3. To do this, we can evaluate the Fourier transform at the specific frequencies of the waveforms.\n\nFor the 100 Hz waveform:\n\nF(2π * 100) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-j * 2π * 100 * t)] dt\n\nFor the 300 Hz waveform:\n\nF(2π * 300) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-j * 2π * 300 * t)] dt\n\nFor the 500 Hz waveform:\n\nF(2π * 500) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-j * 2π * 500 * t)] dt\n\nSince the audio signal is 2 seconds long, we need to integrate over the interval [0, 2]. However, since the signal is periodic, we can also integrate over one period of the signal, which is the least common multiple of the periods of the three waveforms. The periods of the waveforms are:\n\nT1 = 1/100 = 0.01 s\nT2 = 1/300 = 0.003333... s\nT3 = 1/500 = 0.002 s\n\nThe least common multiple of these periods is 0.01 s, so we can integrate over the interval [0, 0.01]:\n\nF(2π * 100) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-j * 2π * 100 * t)] dt from 0 to 0.01\nF(2π * 300) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-j * 2π * 300 * t)] dt from 0 to 0.01\nF(2π * 500) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-j * 2π * 500 * t)] dt from 0 to 0.01\n\nBy evaluating these integrals, we can find the Fourier coefficients for each of the three waveforms. Note that without specific amplitude values (A1, A2, and A3) or a specific function f(t), we cannot provide numerical values for the Fourier coefficients. However, the process outlined above is the correct approach to find the Fourier Series coefficients using the Fourier transform technique."
