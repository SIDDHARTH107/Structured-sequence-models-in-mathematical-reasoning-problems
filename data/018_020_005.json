The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nIntersection of A and B, A ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the elements in either A or B but not in their intersection:\n\nA Δ B = (A - (A ∩ B)) ∪ (B - (A ∩ B))\n= ({1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3, 4}) ∪ ({2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4})\n= {1} ∪ {5}\n= {1, 5}\n\nNow we have A Δ B = {1, 5}. Next, we need to find the union of this set with {3, 4}.\n\n(A Δ B) ∪ {3, 4} = {1, 5} ∪ {3, 4}\n= {1, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSo, (A Δ B) ∪ {3, 4} = {1, 3, 4, 5}."
