    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second and third equations are just multiples of the first equation. To see this, we can divide the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 3:\n\n1. x + 2y + z = 4\n2. x + 2y + z = 4 (after dividing the second equation by 2)\n3. x + 2y + z = 4 (after dividing the third equation by 3)\n\nNow we can see that all three equations are the same. This means that the system of equations has infinitely many solutions, as any solution to the first equation will also be a solution to the second and third equations.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for z:\n\nz = 4 - x - 2y\n\nNow we have a general solution for z in terms of x and y. Since there are infinitely many solutions, we cannot determine specific values for x, y, and z. Instead, we can express the solution as:\n\n(x, y, 4 - x - 2y) for any values of x and y."
