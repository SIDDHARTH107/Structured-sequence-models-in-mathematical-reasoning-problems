    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k members from a group of n people, n! is the factorial of n, and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 8 (the total number of people) and k = 4 (the number of members in the committee).\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!4!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n\nSo, the combination formula becomes:\n\nC(8, 4) = 40,320 / (24 × 24)\n\nC(8, 4) = 40,320 / 576\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nTherefore, there are 70 different committees that can be formed from a group of 8 people."
