    "message_2": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. It consists of three types of bees: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The algorithm iteratively updates the positions of these bees to find the optimal solution.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to solving the given problem using the ABC algorithm:\n\n1. Initialization:\n   Define the search interval [0, 5] and the swarm size of 50. Initialize the positions of the 50 bees randomly within the search interval.\n\n2. Employed bees phase:\n   For each employed bee, generate a new position by modifying its current position using a random neighbor and a random scaling factor. Evaluate the fitness of the new position using the function f(x). If the new position has a better fitness, replace the current position with the new position.\n\n3. Onlooker bees phase:\n   Calculate the probability of selecting each employed bee based on their fitness. For each onlooker bee, select an employed bee using the roulette wheel selection method and generate a new position using the same method as in the employed bees phase. Update the position if the new position has a better fitness.\n\n4. Scout bees phase:\n   If an employed bee's position has not been updated for a certain number of iterations (called the \"limit\"), replace its position with a new random position within the search interval.\n\n5. Termination condition:\n   Repeat steps 2-4 for a predefined number of iterations or until the minimum value converges.\n\nAfter running the ABC algorithm, the bee with the best position (i.e., the minimum value of f(x)) will provide the solution to the problem.\n\nPlease note that as an AI language model, I cannot execute the algorithm and provide a specific numerical answer. However, you can implement the ABC algorithm in a programming language of your choice (such as Python, MATLAB, or R) and use it to find the minimum value of the given function."
