    "message_1": "A student is standing 50 meters away from a tall building. The student measures the angle of elevation to the top of the building to be 30 degrees. Calculate the height of the building to the nearest meter.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this problem, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, the distance from the student to the building (adjacent side) is 50 meters, and we want to find the height of the building (opposite side).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(30°) = height / 50\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 50:\n\nheight = 50 * tan(30°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into the equation:\n\nheight ≈ 50 * 0.577\n\nheight ≈ 28.85\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the height of the building is approximately 29 meters."
