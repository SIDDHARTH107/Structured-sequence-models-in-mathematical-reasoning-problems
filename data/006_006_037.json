    "message_1": "In a football match between Barcelona and Real Madrid, the probability of Barcelona winning is 0.6. If you bet $50 on Barcelona winning and they do win, how much money will you win, assuming the odds are in your favor and you get a payout of 1.5 times the amount you bet?",
    "message_2": "If you bet $50 on Barcelona winning and they do win, you will get a payout of 1.5 times the amount you bet. \n\nTo calculate the winnings, multiply the amount you bet ($50) by the payout multiplier (1.5):\n\n$50 * 1.5 = $75\n\nSo, if Barcelona wins, you will win $75."
