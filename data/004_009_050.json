    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x)(x^3 - 4x) using the product rule, we first identify the two functions being multiplied together: u(x) = 2x^2 + 3x and v(x) = x^3 - 4x.\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = d(2x^2 + 3x)/dx = 4x + 3\nv'(x) = d(x^3 - 4x)/dx = 3x^2 - 4\n\nNow, we apply the product rule:\n\nf'(x) = (4x + 3)(x^3 - 4x) + (2x^2 + 3x)(3x^2 - 4)\n\nNext, we expand the terms:\n\nf'(x) = 4x(x^3) - 4x(4x) + 3(x^3) - 3(4x) + 6x^4 - 8x^2 + 9x^3 - 12x\n\nNow, we simplify and combine like terms:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^4 + 4x^4 + 9x^3 - 16x^2 - 12x\n\nFinally, we have the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 10x^4 + 9x^3 - 16x^2 - 12x"
