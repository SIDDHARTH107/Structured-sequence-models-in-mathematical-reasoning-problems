    "message_2": "If Ɣ ⊢ A and Ɣ ⊢ ¬B both hold true, then we have a contradiction in the context of intuitionistic logic. In intuitionistic logic, a formula A → B is provable if and only if, whenever A is provable, B is also provable. However, in this case, we have that A is provable (Ɣ ⊢ A), but the negation of B is also provable (Ɣ ⊢ ¬B). This means that B is not provable, which contradicts the assumption that Ɣ ⊢ A → B.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the formula Ɣ ⊢ A → B cannot hold true under these conditions in intuitionistic logic."
