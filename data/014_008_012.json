    "message_1": "Consider a block cipher that uses a key size of 128 bits and operates on blocks of size 64 bits. If a message is encrypted using this cipher and the resulting ciphertext is 256 bits long, what is the size of the plaintext message in bits?",
    "message_2": "Since the block cipher operates on blocks of size 64 bits, and the resulting ciphertext is 256 bits long, this means that the ciphertext consists of 4 blocks (256 bits / 64 bits per block = 4 blocks).\n\nSince the block cipher processes plaintext blocks of the same size as the ciphertext blocks, the size of the plaintext message is also 4 blocks of 64 bits each. Therefore, the size of the plaintext message is 4 blocks * 64 bits per block = 256 bits."
