    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of 120: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of abelian groups of order 120: There is only one abelian group of order 120, which is the cyclic group Z_120.\n3. Determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 120: We can use the formula for the number of groups of order p^aq^b, where p and q are distinct primes, and a and b are positive integers. In this case, p = 2, q = 3, a = 3, and b = 1. The formula is:\n\n   (p^(a-1) * (p-1)) * (q^(b-1) * (q-1))\n\n   (2^(3-1) * (2-1)) * (3^(1-1) * (3-1))\n\n   (2^2 * 1) * (3^0 * 2)\n\n   (4 * 1) * (1 * 2)\n\n   4 * 2 = 8\n\nHowever, this formula gives the number of groups of order p^aq^b, which includes abelian groups. Since we have already counted the abelian group Z_120, we need to subtract 1 from the result:\n\n   8 - 1 = 7\n\nTherefore, there are 7 non-abelian groups of order 120.\n\nIn total, there are 1 (abelian) + 7 (non-abelian) = 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
