    "message_2": "There are two distinct groups of order 4: the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4.\n\n1. Cyclic group C4: This group has elements {1, a, a^2, a^3}, where a is a generator of the group and a^4 = 1. The group is generated by a single element, and its operation is defined by the powers of the generator. The group is Abelian, meaning that the group operation is commutative.\n\n2. Klein four-group V4: This group has elements {1, a, b, c}, where a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1, and ab = c, ba = c, ac = b, ca = b, bc = a, cb = a. The group is not cyclic, as it cannot be generated by a single element. However, it is also Abelian.\n\nBoth of these groups are isomorphic to themselves, as they are distinct groups with different structures. C4 is isomorphic to C4, and V4 is isomorphic to V4."
