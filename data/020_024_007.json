    "message_1": "A company is selling a product that has a fixed production cost of $500 and a variable cost of $100 per unit. The demand function for the product is given by Q = 200 - 4P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price in dollars per unit. Determine the price that the company should set in order to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we first need to find the revenue function and the cost function. Then, we will find the profit function by subtracting the cost function from the revenue function. Finally, we will find the critical points of the profit function and determine the price that maximizes the profit.\n\n1. Revenue Function:\nRevenue = Price × Quantity\nR(P) = P × Q\nSince Q = 200 - 4P, we can substitute this into the revenue function:\nR(P) = P × (200 - 4P)\n\n2. Cost Function:\nThe cost function consists of the fixed cost and the variable cost.\nC(Q) = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost × Quantity\nC(Q) = 500 + 100Q\nSince Q = 200 - 4P, we can substitute this into the cost function:\nC(P) = 500 + 100(200 - 4P)\n\n3. Profit Function:\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nΠ(P) = R(P) - C(P)\nΠ(P) = P(200 - 4P) - (500 + 100(200 - 4P))\n\nNow, let's simplify the profit function:\nΠ(P) = 200P - 4P^2 - 500 - 20000 + 400P\nΠ(P) = -4P^2 + 600P - 20500\n\n4. Find the critical points:\nTo find the critical points, we need to take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to P and set it equal to 0.\nΠ'(P) = d(Π(P))/dP = -8P + 600\n\nSet Π'(P) = 0:\n-8P + 600 = 0\n8P = 600\nP = 75\n\n5. Determine the maximum profit:\nSince the second derivative of the profit function, Π''(P) = -8, is negative, the critical point P = 75 corresponds to a maximum. Therefore, the company should set the price at $75 per unit to maximize its profit."
