    "message_1": "A student wants to pack a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity of 10 pounds. The following items are available to choose from:\n\n- Item 1: 2 pounds, valued at $10\n- Item 2: 3 pounds, valued at $14\n- Item 3: 5 pounds, valued at $20\n- Item 4: 7 pounds, valued at $24\n\nWhat is the maximum value the student can pack in the knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value the student can pack in the knapsack, we need to consider different combinations of items that do not exceed the 10-pound weight limit. Here are the possible combinations:\n\n1. Item 1 + Item 2: Total weight = 2 + 3 = 5 pounds, Total value = $10 + $14 = $24\n2. Item 1 + Item 3: Total weight = 2 + 5 = 7 pounds, Total value = $10 + $20 = $30\n3. Item 1 + Item 4: Total weight = 2 + 7 = 9 pounds, Total value = $10 + $24 = $34\n4. Item 2 + Item 3: Total weight = 3 + 5 = 8 pounds, Total value = $14 + $20 = $34\n5. Item 2 + Item 4: Total weight = 3 + 7 = 10 pounds, Total value = $14 + $24 = $38\n6. Item 3 + Item 4: Total weight = 5 + 7 = 12 pounds (exceeds the weight limit, so not a valid combination)\n\nThe maximum value the student can pack in the knapsack is $38, which can be achieved by packing Item 2 and Item 4."
