    "message_1": "A population of adults has a mean weight of 165 pounds with a standard deviation of 20 pounds. A sample of 50 adults is taken, and the mean weight is calculated to be 160 pounds. Conduct a hypothesis test with a significance level of 0.05 to determine whether the sample mean weight is significantly less than the population mean weight.",
    "message_2": "To conduct a hypothesis test, we need to set up our null and alternative hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): The sample mean weight is not significantly less than the population mean weight. (µ = 165)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): The sample mean weight is significantly less than the population mean weight. (µ < 165)\n\nWe will use a one-sample t-test to test our hypotheses. First, we need to calculate the t-score:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\nt = (160 - 165) / (20 / sqrt(50))\nt = (-5) / (20 / 7.071)\nt = -5 / 2.828\nt ≈ -1.77\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 49 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1):\n\nUsing a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.676.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-1.77) is less than the critical t-value (-1.676), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is evidence to suggest that the sample mean weight is significantly less than the population mean weight at a significance level of 0.05."
