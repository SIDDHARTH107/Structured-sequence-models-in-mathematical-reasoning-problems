    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 35, we know that |G| = 35. The prime factorization of 35 is 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are distinct prime numbers. According to the Sylow theorems, we can find Sylow p-subgroups for each of these prime factors.\n\nLet P be a Sylow 5-subgroup of G and Q be a Sylow 7-subgroup of G. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility for n_7 is also 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup, they must both be normal subgroups of G. Now, we know that |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7, and since 5 and 7 are prime numbers, P and Q are both cyclic groups. Let P = ⟨a⟩ and Q = ⟨b⟩, where a has order 5 and b has order 7.\n\nSince P and Q are normal subgroups of G, we can consider the product PQ. Since |P| and |Q| are relatively prime, we have |P ∩ Q| = 1, which means that P and Q only have the identity element in common. Therefore, the product PQ has order |P| * |Q| = 5 * 7 = 35, which is equal to the order of G.\n\nThus, G = PQ, and G is isomorphic to the direct product of the cyclic groups P and Q, which have orders 5 and 7, respectively. In other words, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, and G is not cyclic since it is not generated by a single element."
