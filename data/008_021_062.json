    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n \nx + 2y - 3z = 7\n \n2x + 4y - 6z = 14\n \n3x + 6y - 9z = 21\n \nDetermine whether the system has a unique solution or not, and if it does not, give the general solution of the system.",
    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second equation is just the first equation multiplied by 2, and the third equation is the first equation multiplied by 3. This means that the three equations are linearly dependent, and the system does not have a unique solution.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 7 - 2y + 3z\n\nNow we can write the general solution as:\n\n(x, y, z) = (7 - 2y + 3z, y, z)\n\nwhere y and z can be any real numbers."
