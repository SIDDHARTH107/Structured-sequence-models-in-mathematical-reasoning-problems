    "message_2": "To find the isomorphism classes of groups of order 36, we first consider the prime factorization of 36, which is 2^2 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of these groups.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: There are either 1 or 9 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4. If there is only 1 Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal. If there are 9 Sylow 2-subgroups, none of them are normal.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: There are either 1 or 4 Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9. If there is only 1 Sylow 3-subgroup, it is normal. If there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, none of them are normal.\n\nNow, we consider the different cases:\n\nCase 1: Both Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups are normal.\nIn this case, the group is a direct product of the normal Sylow 2-subgroup and the normal Sylow 3-subgroup. The Sylow 2-subgroup can be either cyclic (Z_4) or the Klein four group (V_4). The Sylow 3-subgroup can be either cyclic (Z_9) or the non-abelian group of order 9 (which is isomorphic to the semidirect product Z_3 ⋊ Z_3). This gives us four possibilities:\n1. Z_4 × Z_9 (cyclic group of order 36, Z_36)\n2. Z_4 × (Z_3 ⋊ Z_3)\n3. V_4 × Z_9\n4. V_4 × (Z_3 ⋊ Z_3)\n\nCase 2: Only the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal.\nIn this case, the group is a semidirect product of the normal Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. The Sylow 2-subgroup can be either Z_4 or V_4, and the Sylow 3-subgroup can be either Z_9 or Z_3 ⋊ Z_3. However, since the Sylow 3-subgroup is not normal, the only possible structure is:\n5. V_4 ⋊ Z_9\n\nCase 3: Only the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal.\nIn this case, the group is a semidirect product of the normal Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 2-subgroup. The Sylow 2-subgroup can be either Z_4 or V_4, and the Sylow 3-subgroup can be either Z_9 or Z_3 ⋊ Z_3. However, since the Sylow 2-subgroup is not normal, the only possible structure is:\n6. Z_9 ⋊ Z_4\n\nCase 4: Neither the Sylow 2-subgroup nor the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal.\nIn this case, there is no direct or semidirect product structure. However, there is no group of order 36 that falls into this category, so there are no additional isomorphism classes in this case.\n\nIn summary, there are six isomorphism classes of groups of order 36:\n\n1. Z_36 (cyclic group)\n2. Z_4 × (Z_3 ⋊ Z_3)\n3. V_4 × Z_9\n4. V_4 × (Z_3 ⋊ Z_3)\n5. V_4 ⋊ Z_9\n6. Z_9 ⋊ Z_4"
