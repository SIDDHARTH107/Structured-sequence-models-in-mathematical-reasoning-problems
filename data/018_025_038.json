    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the intersection of sets A and (A △ B) (where △ denotes the symmetric difference operation). Show that the order in which you perform these operations affects the outcome, hence proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B (A △ B). The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nSo, A △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of sets A and (A △ B):\n\nA ∩ (A △ B) = {1, 2, 3} ∩ {1, 4} = {1}\n\nNow, let's try to perform the operations in a different order. Let's first find the intersection of A and B, and then find the symmetric difference of the result with B:\n\n(A ∩ B) △ B = {2, 3} △ {2, 3, 4}\n\n(A ∩ B) △ B = ({2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({2, 3} ∩ {2, 3, 4})\n= {2, 3, 4} - {2, 3}\n= {4}\n\nAs we can see, the outcomes of the two operations are different:\n\nA ∩ (A △ B) = {1}\n(A ∩ B) △ B = {4}\n\nThis shows that the order in which you perform these operations affects the outcome, hence proving that the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
