The numbers on each road represent the maximum amount of traffic that can flow through that road per hour. \n\n[Insert Image]\n\nWhat is the maximum flow that can be transported from city A to city D per hour?",
    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot see the image you are referring to. However, I can help you solve the problem if you provide the traffic capacities for each road connecting the cities. Please list the roads and their capacities, for example: A to B: 10, A to C: 20, B to D: 15, and so on."
