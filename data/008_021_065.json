    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution, elimination, or matrix. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can observe that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. We can divide the second equation by 2:\n\n(4x + 6y = 18) / 2\n2x + 3y = 9\n\nNow we have:\n\n2x + 3y = 9 (Equation 1)\n2x + 3y = 9 (Equation 2)\n\nSince both equations are the same, they represent the same line in the xy-plane. This means that there are infinitely many solutions for x and y that satisfy both equations, as they are dependent equations. To find the general solution, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can solve for y:\n\n3y = 9 - 2x\ny = (9 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow we have a general solution for y in terms of x:\n\ny = (9 - 2x) / 3\n\nSince there are infinitely many solutions, we cannot provide a unique solution for x and y. However, we have expressed y in terms of x, which represents all possible solutions for this system of linear equations."
