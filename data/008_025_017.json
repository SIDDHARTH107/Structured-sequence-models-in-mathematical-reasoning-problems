    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution, elimination, or comparison. In this case, we will use the method of comparison.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the second equation in terms of the first equation:\n\nThe second equation is 4x + 6y = 24. We can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:\n\n2x + 3y = 12\n\nNow, we can compare the two equations:\n\n1) 2x + 3y = 12\n2) 2x + 3y = 12\n\nSince both equations are the same, they represent the same line in the coordinate plane. This means that there are infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line is a solution to the system of equations."
