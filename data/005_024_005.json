    "message_1": "A clothing store conducted a survey on the age of its customers using a sample size of 100 people. The results showed that the average age of the customers was 35 years with a standard deviation of 5 years. What is the Z-score for a customer who is 3 standard deviations older than the mean age of the customers?",
    "message_2": "To find the Z-score for a customer who is 3 standard deviations older than the mean age, we first need to determine their age. Since the mean age is 35 years and the standard deviation is 5 years, we can calculate the age of this customer as follows:\n\nAge = Mean + (Standard Deviations * Standard Deviation)\nAge = 35 + (3 * 5)\nAge = 35 + 15\nAge = 50 years\n\nNow, we can calculate the Z-score using the formula:\n\nZ-score = (Observed Value - Mean) / Standard Deviation\nZ-score = (50 - 35) / 5\nZ-score = 15 / 5\nZ-score = 3\n\nSo, the Z-score for a customer who is 3 standard deviations older than the mean age of the customers is 3."
