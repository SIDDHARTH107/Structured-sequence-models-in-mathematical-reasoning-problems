    "message_1": "Consider the wave equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = 4 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$,\n\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is a function that describes the displacement of a string at position $x$ and time $t$. Suppose the string is fixed at both ends, i.e., $u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0$ for all $t$, and suppose the initial velocity of the string is zero everywhere, i.e., $u_t(x,0) = 0$ and $u(x,0) = f(x)$ for some function $f(x)$. \n\nFind $u(x,t)$ for $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $t \\geq 0$, given that $f(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$ and $u(x,0) = f(x)$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution $u(x,t)$ can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$. That is, $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. \n\nSubstituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)$.\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$.\n\nSince the left-hand side depends only on $t$ and the right-hand side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant. We denote this constant by $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$.\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $T''(t) + \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$.\n\n2) $X''(x) + \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4} X(x) = 0$.\n\nWe first solve the equation for $X(x)$. Since the string is fixed at both ends, we have the boundary conditions $X(0) = X(1) = 0$. The general solution to the second equation is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}x) + B\\cos(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}x)$.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$X(0) = B = 0$ and $X(1) = A\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}) = 0$.\n\nSince $A$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\sin(\\frac{\\lambda}{2}) = 0$. This implies that $\\frac{\\lambda}{2} = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. Thus, $\\lambda = 2n\\pi$ and the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$X_n(x) = A_n\\sin(2n\\pi x)$.\n\nNow, we solve the equation for $T(t)$. The general solution to the first equation is:\n\n$T(t) = C\\cos(\\lambda t) + D\\sin(\\lambda t)$.\n\nSince the initial velocity is zero, we have $u_t(x,0) = 0$. Differentiating $u(x,t)$ with respect to $t$ and applying the initial condition, we get:\n\n$0 = X(x)T'(t) = X(x)(-2n\\pi C\\sin(2n\\pi t) + 2n\\pi D\\cos(2n\\pi t))$.\n\nAt $t = 0$, this becomes:\n\n$0 = 2n\\pi D$.\n\nThus, $D = 0$ and the solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$T_n(t) = C_n\\cos(2n\\pi t)$.\n\nNow, we have the separated solutions:\n\n$u_n(x,t) = X_n(x)T_n(t) = A_n\\sin(2n\\pi x)C_n\\cos(2n\\pi t)$.\n\nBy the principle of superposition, the general solution is a sum of these separated solutions:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(2n\\pi x)C_n\\cos(2n\\pi t)$.\n\nWe are given the initial displacement $u(x,0) = f(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$. Plugging in $t = 0$, we get:\n\n$\\sin(\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(2n\\pi x)C_n$.\n\nSince $f(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, we can see that only the term with $n = 1$ will contribute to the sum. Therefore, $A_1C_1 = 1$ and $A_nC_n = 0$ for $n > 1$. We can choose $A_1 = C_1 = 1$ and $A_n = 0$ for $n > 1$. \n\nThus, the solution to the wave equation is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin(2\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi t)$ for $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $t \\geq 0$."
