    "message_2": "To decrypt the ciphertext using RSA, we need to find the private key exponent (d) and use the following formula:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext^d) mod n\n\nwhere n is the modulus, and d is the private key exponent.\n\nHowever, we are not given the private key exponent (d) or the two prime factors (p and q) of the modulus (n). Without this information, it is not possible to decrypt the ciphertext directly.\n\nIf you have more information about the prime factors of the modulus or the private key exponent, please provide it, and I can help you decrypt the ciphertext."
