    "message_2": "To find the energy level E for the first excited state of the harmonic oscillator potential, we will use the Hermite polynomial solutions to the Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equation for the harmonic oscillator is given by:\n\n$-u''(x) + x^2u(x) = Eu(x)$\n\nWe can rewrite this equation in terms of a dimensionless variable $\\xi$:\n\n$\\xi = \\sqrt{\\frac{m\\omega}{\\hbar}}x$\n\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the particle, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The Schrödinger equation then becomes:\n\n$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2u}{d\\xi^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\xi^2u = Eu$\n\nNow, we introduce the Hermite polynomials, which are solutions to the Hermite differential equation:\n\n$H_n'(\\xi) - 2\\xi H_n(\\xi) = -2nH_n(\\xi)$\n\nThe Hermite polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the weight function $e^{-\\xi^2}$, and they form a complete set of functions. The wave function for the harmonic oscillator can be written as a product of a Hermite polynomial and a Gaussian function:\n\n$u_n(\\xi) = N_n H_n(\\xi)e^{-\\xi^2/2}$\n\nwhere $N_n$ is a normalization constant. Substituting this wave function into the Schrödinger equation, we obtain:\n\n$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{d\\xi^2}(N_n H_n(\\xi)e^{-\\xi^2/2}) + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\xi^2(N_n H_n(\\xi)e^{-\\xi^2/2}) = EN_n H_n(\\xi)e^{-\\xi^2/2}$\n\nNow, we use the Hermite differential equation to simplify the second derivative term:\n\n$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}(N_n(-2nH_n(\\xi)e^{-\\xi^2/2} + 2\\xi H_n'(\\xi)e^{-\\xi^2/2})) + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\xi^2(N_n H_n(\\xi)e^{-\\xi^2/2}) = EN_n H_n(\\xi)e^{-\\xi^2/2}$\n\nDividing by $N_n H_n(\\xi)e^{-\\xi^2/2}$, we get:\n\n$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}(-2n + 2\\xi\\frac{H_n'(\\xi)}{H_n(\\xi)}) + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\xi^2 = E$\n\nFor the first excited state, we have $n=1$. The Hermite polynomial for $n=1$ is $H_1(\\xi) = 2\\xi$, and its derivative is $H_1'(\\xi) = 2$. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}(-2 + 2) + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2\\xi^2 = E$\n\nSince the left-hand side is independent of $\\xi$, the energy level E for the first excited state is:\n\n$E_1 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m} = \\hbar\\omega(1+\\frac{1}{2})$\n\nSo, the energy level for the first excited state of the harmonic oscillator potential is:\n\n$E_1 = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$"
