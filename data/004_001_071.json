    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^2 - 2x + 1, we will apply the power rule, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1).\n\nThe derivative of f(x) with respect to x, denoted as f'(x), is:\n\nf'(x) = d(5x^2)/dx - d(2x)/dx + d(1)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 5(2x^(2-1)) - 2(1x^(1-1))\n\nf'(x) = 10x - 2\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the derivative at x = 3:\n\nf'(3) = 10(3) - 2\n\nf'(3) = 30 - 2\n\nf'(3) = 28\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^2 - 2x + 1 at x = 3 is 28."
