    "message_1": "Suppose there are 6 people standing in a straight line waiting for a bus. In how many ways can they all shake hands with each other without the crossing of hands? (Hint: The number of handshakes between any two people is just 1, and each person shakes hands with exactly two others.) \n\nThe answer involves computing the sixth Catalan number.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of Catalan numbers. The nth Catalan number can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC_n = (1/(n+1)) * (2n choose n) = (1/(n+1)) * (2n! / (n! * n!))\n\nIn this case, we have 6 people, so we want to find the number of ways they can shake hands without crossing hands. This is equivalent to finding the sixth Catalan number, C_6.\n\nC_6 = (1/(6+1)) * (2*6 choose 6) = (1/7) * (12! / (6! * 6!))\n\nNow, we calculate the factorials:\n\n12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 479001600\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n\nC_6 = (1/7) * (479001600 / (720 * 720))\nC_6 = (1/7) * (479001600 / 33177600)\nC_6 = (1/7) * 132\n\nFinally, we get the sixth Catalan number:\n\nC_6 = 132/7 = 18.857\n\nHowever, Catalan numbers are always integers, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's recompute the binomial coefficient (2n choose n) more carefully:\n\n(2*6 choose 6) = (12! / (6! * 6!)) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 924\n\nNow we can recompute the sixth Catalan number:\n\nC_6 = (1/7) * 924 = 132\n\nSo there are 132 ways for the 6 people to shake hands without crossing hands."
