    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor (step size).\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are N = 5 self-similar pieces. Given a step size of 2 units, the scaling factor s = 2.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(5) / log(2)\n\nD â‰ˆ 2.322\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with a step size of 2 units is approximately 2.322."
