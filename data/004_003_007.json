    "message_1": "A rectangular plot of land is to be fenced using 100 meters of fencing. The plot is adjacent to a river, so no fencing is needed on that side. Determine the dimensions of the plot that will enclose the maximum area. Solve the problem using calculus.",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the plot parallel to the river be x meters, and the width perpendicular to the river be y meters. Since no fencing is needed on the side adjacent to the river, the total fencing used will be the sum of the other three sides:\n\nx + 2y = 100\n\nWe want to maximize the area of the plot, which is given by:\n\nA = xy\n\nFirst, we need to express the area in terms of one variable. We can do this by solving the fencing equation for y and substituting it into the area equation:\n\ny = (100 - x) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the area equation:\n\nA(x) = x((100 - x) / 2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nA(x) = 50x - (1/2)x^2\n\nNow we will use calculus to find the maximum area. Take the derivative of A(x) with respect to x:\n\ndA/dx = 50 - x\n\nTo find the critical points, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 50 - x\nx = 50\n\nNow we need to determine if this critical point corresponds to a maximum area. Take the second derivative of A(x) with respect to x:\n\nd^2A/dx^2 = -1\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the critical point x = 50 corresponds to a maximum area. Now we can find the dimensions of the plot. Substitute x = 50 back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (100 - 50) / 2\ny = 25\n\nSo the dimensions of the plot that will enclose the maximum area are 50 meters parallel to the river and 25 meters perpendicular to the river."
