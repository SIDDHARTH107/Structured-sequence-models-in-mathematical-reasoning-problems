    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, and so on. To find the 10th Mersenne prime, we need to find the first 10 prime values of n for which M_n is also prime.\n\nHere are the first 10 prime values of n for which M_n is prime:\n\n1. n = 2, M_2 = 2^2 - 1 = 3\n2. n = 3, M_3 = 2^3 - 1 = 7\n3. n = 5, M_5 = 2^5 - 1 = 31\n4. n = 7, M_7 = 2^7 - 1 = 127\n5. n = 13, M_13 = 2^13 - 1 = 8191\n6. n = 17, M_17 = 2^17 - 1 = 131071\n7. n = 19, M_19 = 2^19 - 1 = 524287\n8. n = 31, M_31 = 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647\n9. n = 61, M_61 = 2^61 - 1 = 2305843009213693951\n10. n = 89, M_89 = 2^89 - 1 = 618970019642690137449562111\n\nSo, the 10th Mersenne prime is 618970019642690137449562111."
