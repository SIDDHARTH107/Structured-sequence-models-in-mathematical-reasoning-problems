    "message_2": "To find the treewidth of the given graph G, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find a tree decomposition of the graph.\n2. Determine the width of the tree decomposition.\n3. Minimize the width to find the treewidth.\n\nA tree decomposition of the graph G can be constructed as follows:\n\n1. Create a bag for each vertex in the graph.\n2. For each edge in the graph, add both vertices to a common bag.\n3. Connect the bags in a tree-like structure.\n\nHere's a possible tree decomposition for the given graph G:\n\n- Bag 1: {A, B, C}\n- Bag 2: {B, C, D}\n- Bag 3: {C, D, E}\n- Bag 4: {D, E, F}\n- Bag 5: {E, F, G}\n- Bag 6: {F, G, H}\n- Bag 7: {G, H, I}\n- Bag 8: {H, I, J}\n- Bag 9: {I, J, K}\n\nConnect the bags as follows:\n\nBag 1 - Bag 2 - Bag 3 - Bag 4 - Bag 5 - Bag 6 - Bag 7 - Bag 8 - Bag 9\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus one. In this case, the largest bag has 3 vertices, so the width is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimum width of the tree decomposition of the given graph G is 2."
