    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of 1000 men aged between 40-50 years, at least 50 will be affected by diabetes if the probability of a man in this age group being affected by diabetes is 0.08?",
    "message_2": "We will use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, men affected by diabetes) out of n trials (in this case, 1000 men)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of a single success (in this case, a man being affected by diabetes, which is 0.08)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 1000 men)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, we want to find the probability of at least 50 men being affected by diabetes)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 50 men being affected by diabetes, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 50, 51, 52, ..., 1000. However, calculating this directly would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can find the complementary probability (i.e., the probability of fewer than 50 men being affected by diabetes) and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we will find the sum of probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 49 and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 50) = 1 - P(X < 50) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 49\n\nNow, we will calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 49:\n\nΣ P(X = k) = Σ [C(1000, k) * (0.08)^k * (1-0.08)^(1000-k)] for k = 0 to 49\n\nCalculating this sum directly is still time-consuming, so we can use a cumulative binomial probability calculator or software (such as Excel, R, or Python) to find the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 49.\n\nUsing a cumulative binomial probability calculator, we find that:\n\nP(X < 50) ≈ 0.000006\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 50 men being affected by diabetes:\n\nP(X ≥ 50) = 1 - P(X < 50) = 1 - 0.000006 ≈ 0.999994\n\nSo, the probability that at least 50 out of 1000 men aged between 40-50 years will be affected by diabetes is approximately 0.999994 or 99.9994%."
