    "message_1": "A thin wire 10 cm long is bent into a semi-circular loop of radius 5 cm. The temperature along the wire is given by the equation:\n\nT(x) = 100 - (100/π) ∑[n=1 to ∞] (1/n) sin[(nπx)/L] exp[-(nπ/10) t]\n\nWhere L is the length of the wire, and t is time in seconds. What is the temperature at the middle point of the wire, x = L/2, at t = 2 seconds?",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature at the middle point of the wire (x = L/2) at t = 2 seconds, we need to plug these values into the given equation:\n\nT(x) = 100 - (100/π) ∑[n=1 to ∞] (1/n) sin[(nπx)/L] exp[-(nπ/10) t]\n\nFirst, let's plug in the values for x and t:\n\nx = L/2 = 10/2 = 5 cm\nt = 2 seconds\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nT(5) = 100 - (100/π) ∑[n=1 to ∞] (1/n) sin[(nπ*5)/10] exp[-(nπ/10) * 2]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nT(5) = 100 - (100/π) ∑[n=1 to ∞] (1/n) sin[(nπ)/2] exp[-(nπ/5)]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the infinite sum. Notice that sin[(nπ)/2] is equal to 1 when n is an odd number and 0 when n is an even number. Therefore, we only need to consider odd values of n in the sum:\n\nT(5) = 100 - (100/π) ∑[n=odd] (1/n) exp[-(nπ/5)]\n\nTo approximate the sum, we can consider the first few terms:\n\nT(5) ≈ 100 - (100/π) [(1/1) exp[-(1π/5)] + (1/3) exp[-(3π/5)] + (1/5) exp[-(5π/5)] + ...]\n\nThe sum converges relatively quickly, so we can truncate it after a few terms to get a good approximation:\n\nT(5) ≈ 100 - (100/π) [(1/1) exp[-(1π/5)] + (1/3) exp[-(3π/5)] + (1/5) exp[-(5π/5)]]\n\nNow, we can calculate the values:\n\nT(5) ≈ 100 - (100/π) [exp(-π/5) + (1/3) exp(-3π/5) + (1/5) exp(-π)]\n\nT(5) ≈ 100 - (100/π) [0.819 + 0.109 + 0.033]\n\nT(5) ≈ 100 - (100/π) [0.961]\n\nT(5) ≈ 100 - 30.57\n\nT(5) ≈ 69.43\n\nSo, the temperature at the middle point of the wire (x = L/2) at t = 2 seconds is approximately 69.43°C."
