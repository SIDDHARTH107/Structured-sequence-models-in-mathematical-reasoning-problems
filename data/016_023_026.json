    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal, there are 5 self-similar pieces (the four smaller squares in the corners and the one in the center). The scaling factor (s) can be found by dividing the length of the square sides by the line thickness. In this case, s = 100 / 2 = 50.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(5) / log(50)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.365\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with square sides of 100 units and line thickness of 2 units is approximately 1.365."
