    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of $2P$, we will use the formulas for point doubling on an elliptic curve. Since $P = (x_1, y_1) = (1, 2)$, we have:\n\n1. The slope of the tangent line at point $P$ is given by:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{3x_1^2 + a}{2y_1} = \\frac{3(1)^2 - 10}{2(2)} = \\frac{-7}{4}$$\nwhere $a = -10$ is the coefficient of the $x$ term in the elliptic curve equation.\n\n2. The x-coordinate of the point $2P$ is given by:\n$$x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_1 = \\left(\\frac{-7}{4}\\right)^2 - 1 - 1 = \\frac{49}{16} - 2 = \\frac{17}{16}$$\n\n3. The y-coordinate of the point $2P$ is given by:\n$$y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 = \\frac{-7}{4}\\left(1 - \\frac{17}{16}\\right) - 2 = \\frac{-7}{4}\\left(\\frac{-1}{16}\\right) - 2 = \\frac{7}{64} - 2 = \\frac{-121}{64}$$\n\nSo, the coordinates of $2P$ are $\\left(\\frac{17}{16}, \\frac{-121}{64}\\right)$."
