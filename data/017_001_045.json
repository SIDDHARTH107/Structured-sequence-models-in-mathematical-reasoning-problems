    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to C4 or V4, we will examine the properties of the elements in G.\n\nFirst, note that since G has order 4, there are 4 elements in G. Let's denote these elements as {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element.\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to C4\nIf G is isomorphic to C4, then there exists an element, say a, such that a has order 4. This means that a^4 = e, and a, a^2, a^3, and a^4 = e are all distinct elements in G. In this case, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to V4\nIf G is isomorphic to V4, then every non-identity element in G has order 2. This means that a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. In this case, G = {e, a, b, c} with the property that a * b = c, b * c = a, and a * c = b.\n\nNow, we will examine the properties of the elements in G to determine which case holds.\n\nIf there exists an element of order 4 in G, then G is isomorphic to C4. If not, then every non-identity element in G must have order 2, and G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nTo prove this, we will use the property of group orders. In a finite group, the order of an element divides the order of the group. Since the order of G is 4, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, and 4. The identity element e has order 1, so we only need to consider the orders of a, b, and c.\n\nIf any of a, b, or c has order 4, then G is isomorphic to C4. If not, then all three elements must have order 2, and G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, to determine whether G is isomorphic to C4 or V4, we need to examine the orders of the elements in G. If there exists an element of order 4, then G is isomorphic to C4. Otherwise, G is isomorphic to V4."
