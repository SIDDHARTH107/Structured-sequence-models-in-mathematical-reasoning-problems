    "message_2": "Let's first find the total number of subsets of a set S with n elements. This can be calculated using the formula 2^n, which includes the empty set and the set itself.\n\nSince we want to find the number of subsets that contain at least one element, we need to subtract the empty set from the total number of subsets. So, we have (2^n) - 1 subsets with at least one element.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of subsets where the number of subsets with an odd number of elements is equal to the number of subsets with an even number of elements. This can only happen when n is even.\n\nLet's consider n = 2k, where k is an integer. We can divide the elements of the set into two equal parts, each with k elements. The total number of subsets with an odd number of elements will be equal to the total number of subsets with an even number of elements.\n\nFor each of the k elements in the first half, we can either include it or not include it in a subset. This gives us 2^k possibilities. Similarly, for each of the k elements in the second half, we can either include it or not include it in a subset, giving us another 2^k possibilities.\n\nThe total number of subsets with an odd number of elements is equal to the product of the possibilities for each half, which is (2^k) * (2^k) = 2^(2k). Since n = 2k, this is equal to 2^n.\n\nHowever, we have counted the empty set, which has an even number of elements, so we need to subtract 1 from the total number of subsets with an even number of elements. This gives us (2^n) - 1 subsets with an even number of elements.\n\nSince the number of subsets with an odd number of elements is equal to the number of subsets with an even number of elements, we can add them together to find the total number of subsets that meet the given conditions:\n\nTotal number of subsets = (2^n) - 1 + (2^n) - 1 = 2 * (2^n) - 2.\n\nSo, for a given set S with n elements, where n is even, there are 2 * (2^n) - 2 subsets that contain at least one element and have an equal number of subsets with an odd number of elements and subsets with an even number of elements."
