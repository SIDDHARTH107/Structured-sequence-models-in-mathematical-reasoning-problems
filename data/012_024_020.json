    "message_2": "The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles required on a surface to embed the graph without any edge crossings. For the complete graph K5, which has 5 vertices and 10 edges, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nFor K5, V = 5 and E = 10. Since K5 is not planar, we need to find the smallest genus g such that the inequality holds:\n\n5 - 10 + F = 2 - 2g\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nF = 2g - 3\n\nSince K5 is a complete graph, every face must be a triangle. Therefore, the number of faces F must be a multiple of 3. The smallest genus g that satisfies this condition is g = 2, which gives F = 3. Thus, the genus of the complete graph K5 is 2."
