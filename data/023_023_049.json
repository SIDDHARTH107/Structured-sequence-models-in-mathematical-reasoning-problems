    "message_1": "A communication network has a signal, which can be modeled by the function f(t) = 2sin(100πt) + 3sin(300πt) + 5sin(500πt). Determine its Fourier transform and plot the amplitude spectrum. Find the frequency components present in the signal and their corresponding amplitudes.",
    "message_2": "The given signal is f(t) = 2sin(100πt) + 3sin(300πt) + 5sin(500πt). We can rewrite this signal using Euler's formula:\n\nsin(ωt) = (e^(jωt) - e^(-jωt)) / 2j\n\nSo, f(t) = 2[(e^(j100πt) - e^(-j100πt)) / 2j] + 3[(e^(j300πt) - e^(-j300πt)) / 2j] + 5[(e^(j500πt) - e^(-j500πt)) / 2j]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform F(ω) of f(t):\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nSince f(t) is a sum of sinusoids, we can find the Fourier transform of each sinusoid and then add them together.\n\nLet's find the Fourier transform of each sinusoid:\n\nFor the first sinusoid, 2sin(100πt):\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[2(e^(j100πt) - e^(-j100πt)) / 2j * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nFor the second sinusoid, 3sin(300πt):\n\nF2(ω) = ∫[3(e^(j300πt) - e^(-j300πt)) / 2j * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nFor the third sinusoid, 5sin(500πt):\n\nF3(ω) = ∫[5(e^(j500πt) - e^(-j500πt)) / 2j * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can add these Fourier transforms together:\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω) + F3(ω)\n\nSince the signal is composed of sinusoids with distinct frequencies, the Fourier transform will have impulses at these frequencies and their negative counterparts. Therefore, the amplitude spectrum will have peaks at these frequencies:\n\nFrequency components: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz\nCorresponding amplitudes: 2, 3, and 5\n\nTo plot the amplitude spectrum, you would create a graph with the frequency on the x-axis and amplitude on the y-axis. Place vertical lines at 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz with heights of 2, 3, and 5, respectively."
