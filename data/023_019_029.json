    "message_2": "To find the impulse response of the system, we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of the transfer function H(s). First, let's factor the denominator of H(s):\n\nH(s) = (s - 1)/((s + 1)(s + 3))\n\nNow, we can perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\nH(s) = A/(s + 1) + B/(s + 3)\n\nTo find A and B, we can multiply both sides by the common denominator and solve for A and B:\n\n(s - 1) = A(s + 3) + B(s + 1)\n\nNow, we can solve for A and B by plugging in values of s that make one of the terms zero:\n\nFor s = -1:\n-2 = A(-1 + 3) => A = -1\n\nFor s = -3:\n-4 = B(-3 + 1) => B = 2\n\nSo, our transfer function becomes:\n\nH(s) = -1/(s + 1) + 2/(s + 3)\n\nNow, we can take the inverse Laplace transform of H(s) to find the impulse response h(t):\n\nh(t) = L^(-1){H(s)} = L^(-1){-1/(s + 1) + 2/(s + 3)}\n\nUsing the inverse Laplace transform properties, we can write:\n\nh(t) = -L^(-1){1/(s + 1)} + 2L^(-1){1/(s + 3)}\n\nThe inverse Laplace transforms of these functions are well-known:\n\nh(t) = -e^(-t) + 2e^(-3t)\n\nNow, let's determine the stability of the system. A system is stable if all poles of its transfer function have negative real parts. The poles of H(s) are the roots of the denominator:\n\ns^2 + 4s + 3 = 0\n\nThe roots are s = -1 and s = -3, both of which have negative real parts. Therefore, the system is stable."
