The intersection of two sets contains all the elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 4}\n\nA ∩ B = {2} (since 2 is the only element common to both A and B)\n\nNow, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and C, which is represented by (A ∩ B) x C. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\nC = {5, 6}\n\n(A ∩ B) x C = {(2, 5), (2, 6)}\n\nSo, the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) and C is {(2, 5), (2, 6)}."
