    "message_2": "To determine if the two graphs G and H are isomorphic, we can compare their properties and look for a possible mapping between their vertices.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the degree sequence of both graphs. The degree sequence is a list of the degrees of the vertices in non-increasing order.\n\nDegree sequence of G:\nVertex 1: degree 2\nVertex 2: degree 2\nVertex 3: degree 2\nVertex 4: degree 2\n\nDegree sequence of H:\nVertex 1: degree 2\nVertex 2: degree 2\nVertex 3: degree 2\nVertex 4: degree 2\n\nThe degree sequences of both graphs are the same, which is a necessary condition for isomorphism. Now let's try to find an explicit isomorphism between them.\n\nConsider the following mapping between the vertices of G and H:\n\nf(1) = 1\nf(2) = 3\nf(3) = 2\nf(4) = 4\n\nNow let's check if this mapping preserves adjacency:\n\nIn graph G, vertices 1 and 2 are adjacent. In graph H, f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 3 are also adjacent.\nIn graph G, vertices 1 and 3 are adjacent. In graph H, f(1) = 1 and f(3) = 2 are also adjacent.\nIn graph G, vertices 2 and 4 are adjacent. In graph H, f(2) = 3 and f(4) = 4 are also adjacent.\nIn graph G, vertices 3 and 4 are adjacent. In graph H, f(3) = 2 and f(4) = 4 are also adjacent.\n\nThis mapping preserves non-adjacency as well:\n\nIn graph G, vertices 1 and 4 are not adjacent. In graph H, f(1) = 1 and f(4) = 4 are not adjacent.\nIn graph G, vertices 2 and 3 are not adjacent. In graph H, f(2) = 3 and f(3) = 2 are not adjacent.\n\nSince the mapping f preserves both adjacency and non-adjacency, it is an isomorphism between graphs G and H. Therefore, the graphs G and H are isomorphic."
