    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply by 6 (since there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon).\n\nThe side length of each equilateral triangle is 7 cm (same as the side length of the hexagon). To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nArea of one equilateral triangle = (7² * √3) / 4 = (49 * √3) / 4\n\nNow, multiply the area of one equilateral triangle by 6 to find the area of the hexagon:\n\nArea of hexagon = 6 * (49 * √3) / 4 = (294 * √3) / 4 = 147 * √3 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the hexagon is 147√3 cm²."
