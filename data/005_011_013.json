    "message_1": "A math professor wants to test the effectiveness of a new teaching method on her students' grades. She randomly assigns 50 students to two groups: one group will be taught using the new method, and the other group will be taught using the traditional method. At the end of the semester, she compares the final grades of the two groups. If the standard deviation of the grades for the group taught with the new method is 5 and the standard deviation of grades for the group taught with the traditional method is 8, and the average final grade for the group taught with the new method is 85 and the average final grade for the group taught with the traditional method is 80, has the new teaching method been effective? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if the new teaching method is effective, we will perform a two-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no difference in the effectiveness of the two teaching methods, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a difference in the effectiveness of the two teaching methods.\n\nGiven data:\n- Sample size for both groups (n1 and n2) = 25 (since 50 students are divided into two groups)\n- Standard deviation for the new method (s1) = 5\n- Standard deviation for the traditional method (s2) = 8\n- Average final grade for the new method (x̄1) = 85\n- Average final grade for the traditional method (x̄2) = 80\n- Significance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the pooled standard error (SE):\n\nSE = sqrt[(s1^2/n1) + (s2^2/n2)]\nSE = sqrt[(5^2/25) + (8^2/25)]\nSE = sqrt[(25/25) + (64/25)]\nSE = sqrt[1 + 2.56]\nSE = sqrt[3.56]\nSE ≈ 1.8868\n\nNext, we calculate the t-score:\n\nt = (x̄1 - x̄2) / SE\nt = (85 - 80) / 1.8868\nt ≈ 2.65\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n1 + n2 - 2 = 25 + 25 - 2 = 48. Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.0106.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (2.65) is greater than the critical t-value (2.0106), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1). This means that there is a significant difference in the effectiveness of the two teaching methods, and the new teaching method appears to be more effective than the traditional method at a significance level of 0.05."
