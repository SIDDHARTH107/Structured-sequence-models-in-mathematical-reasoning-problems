    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept(s) of a polynomial equation, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6\n\nWe can try to factor the polynomial to find the x-intercepts. In this case, we can use synthetic division or factoring by grouping. Let's try factoring by grouping:\n\n0 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 6\n0 = x^2(x - 2) - 5(x - 2)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term (x - 2):\n\n0 = (x - 2)(x^2 - 5)\n\nNow, we have two factors: (x - 2) and (x^2 - 5). We need to set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx - 2 = 0\nx = 2\n\nx^2 - 5 = 0\nx^2 = 5\nx = ±√5\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = 2, x = √5, and x = -√5."
