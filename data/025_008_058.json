    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}(X)$, we first need to determine the cohomology groups $H^k(X, \\mathbb{C})$ of the complex projective variety $X$. Since $X$ is defined by a single homogeneous polynomial equation of degree $n$, it is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C})$. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem states that for $k < n$, the cohomology groups of $X$ and $\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C})$ are isomorphic, i.e., $H^k(X, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong H^k(\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C}), \\mathbb{C})$.\n\nThe cohomology groups of $\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C})$ are well-known: $H^k(\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C}), \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}$ if $k$ is even and $0$ if $k$ is odd. Therefore, for $k < n$, we have $H^k(X, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}$ if $k$ is even and $0$ if $k$ is odd.\n\nNow we need to compute the cohomology groups for $k \\geq n$. Since $X$ is a smooth hypersurface, we can use the PoincarÃ© residue formula to compute the cohomology groups. The formula states that $H^k(X, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong H^{k-1}(U, \\mathbb{C})$, where $U$ is the complement of the hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{P}^n(\\mathbb{C})$. Therefore, we have $H^k(X, \\mathbb{C}) = \\mathbb{C}$ if $k = n$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nNow we can compute the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}(X)$. Since $X$ is a smooth hypersurface, it is a Calabi-Yau variety, and its Hodge diamond is symmetric. Therefore, we have $h^{p,q}(X) = h^{q,p}(X)$. The Hodge numbers can be computed as follows:\n\n- $h^{0,0}(X) = h^{n,n}(X) = 1$.\n- $h^{p,0}(X) = h^{0,p}(X) = 0$ for $p > 0$.\n- $h^{p,q}(X) = 0$ for $p + q \\neq n$.\n\nIn summary, the Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}(X)$ of the complex projective variety $X$ are given by:\n\n- $h^{0,0}(X) = h^{n,n}(X) = 1$.\n- $h^{p,0}(X) = h^{0,p}(X) = 0$ for $p > 0$.\n- $h^{p,q}(X) = 0$ for $p + q \\neq n$."
