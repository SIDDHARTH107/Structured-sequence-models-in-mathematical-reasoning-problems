    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line of best fit, we need to calculate the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b) using the least squares method. \n\nFirst, let's find the means of x and y values:\nx̄ = (4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6\nȳ = (10 + 11 + 13 + 14 + 15) / 5 = 63 / 5 = 12.6\n\nNow, let's calculate the slope (m):\nm = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nFor each data point (xi, yi), we calculate (xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ) and (xi - x̄)^2:\n\n(4, 10): (4 - 6)(10 - 12.6) = -2 * -2.6 = 5.2, (-2)^2 = 4\n(5, 11): (5 - 6)(11 - 12.6) = -1 * -1.6 = 1.6, (-1)^2 = 1\n(6, 13): (6 - 6)(13 - 12.6) = 0 * 0.4 = 0, (0)^2 = 0\n(7, 14): (7 - 6)(14 - 12.6) = 1 * 1.4 = 1.4, (1)^2 = 1\n(8, 15): (8 - 6)(15 - 12.6) = 2 * 2.4 = 4.8, (2)^2 = 4\n\nNow, we sum up the results:\nΣ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] = 5.2 + 1.6 + 0 + 1.4 + 4.8 = 13\nΣ(xi - x̄)^2 = 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 10\n\nFinally, we calculate the slope (m):\nm = 13 / 10 = 1.3\n\nNow, let's calculate the y-intercept (b):\nb = ȳ - m * x̄ = 12.6 - 1.3 * 6 = 12.6 - 7.8 = 4.8\n\nSo, the equation of the line of best fit is:\ny = 1.3x + 4.8\n\nTo find the predicted value of y when x is 9, we plug x = 9 into the equation:\ny = 1.3 * 9 + 4.8 = 11.7 + 4.8 = 16.5\n\nThe predicted value of y when x is 9 is 16.5."
