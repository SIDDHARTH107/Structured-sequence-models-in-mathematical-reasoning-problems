    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 7 |\n    | 8 |\n\nNow, we find the inverse of matrix A. To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -5) - (2 * 4) = -15 - 8 = -23\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, we find the inverse of A, denoted as A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nadj(A) = | -5 -2 |\n         | -4  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = (-1/23) * | -5 -2 |\n                   | -4  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = | 5/23  2/23 |\n         | 4/23 -3/23 |\n\nNow, we multiply A^(-1) by B to find the values of X.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\nX = | 5/23  2/23 | * | 7 |\n    | 4/23 -3/23 |   | 8 |\n\nX = | (5/23)*7 + (2/23)*8 |\n    | (4/23)*7 + (-3/23)*8 |\n\nX = | 35/23 + 16/23 |\n    | 28/23 - 24/23 |\n\nX = | 51/23 |\n    |  4/23 |\n\nSo, the values of x and y are:\n\nx = 51/23\ny = 4/23"
