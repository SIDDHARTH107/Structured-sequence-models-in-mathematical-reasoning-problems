    "message_1": "A sample of a radioactive material has an initial mass of 100 grams and a half-life of 10 days. Find the mass of the material after 30 days.",
    "message_2": "To find the mass of the radioactive material after 30 days, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 100 grams, the half-life is 10 days, and the time elapsed is 30 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/2)^(30 / 10)\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/2)^3\n\nFinal mass = 100 * (1/8)\n\nFinal mass = 12.5 grams\n\nSo, after 30 days, the mass of the radioactive material will be 12.5 grams."
