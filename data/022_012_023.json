    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the meromorphic function, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\n$$z^3 - 5z^2 + 7z - 3 = 0$$\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try to factor it. By trying out some integer values, we find that z = 1 is a root:\n\n$$(1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 7(1) - 3 = 0$$\n\nNow we can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor the cubic equation:\n\n$$(z^3 - 5z^2 + 7z - 3) = (z - 1)(z^2 - 4z + 3)$$\n\nNow we can factor the quadratic equation further:\n\n$$(z^2 - 4z + 3) = (z - 1)(z - 3)$$\n\nSo the zeros of the meromorphic function are:\n\n$$z = 1$$ (order 2, since it appears twice in the numerator)\n\n$$z = 3$$ (order 1)\n\nNow, to find the poles of the meromorphic function, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\n$$z^2 - 3z + 2 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n$$(z - 1)(z - 2) = 0$$\n\nSo the poles of the meromorphic function are:\n\n$$z = 1$$ (order 1, since it appears once in the denominator)\n\n$$z = 2$$ (order 1)\n\nIn summary, the meromorphic function has:\n\n- A zero at z = 1 with order 2\n- A zero at z = 3 with order 1\n- A pole at z = 1 with order 1\n- A pole at z = 2 with order 1\n\nNote that the zero and pole at z = 1 cancel each other out, so the function simplifies to:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{(z - 3)}{(z - 2)}$$"
