    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer N such that any graph of order N (i.e., with N vertices) will contain either a red clique of size m or a blue clique of size n. In this case, we are asked to find R(3, 3).\n\nTo find R(3, 3), we can use the following recursive formula:\n\nR(m, n) = R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1)\n\nWe know that R(2, n) = n and R(m, 2) = m for all m and n, so we can use these base cases to find R(3, 3):\n\nR(3, 3) = R(2, 3) + R(3, 2) = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nTherefore, the Ramsey number for a complete graph of 5 vertices, i.e., the smallest number of vertices that guarantees either a red clique of size 3 or a blue clique of size 3, is 6."
