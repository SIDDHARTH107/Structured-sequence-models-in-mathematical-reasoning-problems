    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series representation of the periodic function f(x) = x on the interval -π < x < π, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nωx) + b_n * sin(nωx)]\n\nwhere ω = 2π/T, T is the period of the function, and the coefficients a_n and b_n are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/T) * ∫[f(x) * 1] dx over one period\na_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nωx)] dx over one period\nb_n = (2/T) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nωx)] dx over one period\n\nFor the given function f(x) = x on the interval -π < x < π, the period T = 2π, and ω = 2π/T = 1. Let's find the coefficients a_n and b_n.\n\na_0 = (1/2π) * ∫[-π to π] x dx = (1/2π) * [x^2/2](-π to π) = 0\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] x * cos(nx) dx\nTo find a_n, we need to integrate by parts:\nu = x, dv = cos(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = (1/n) * sin(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(x * (1/n) * sin(nx))(-π to π) - ∫[-π to π] (1/n) * sin(nx) dx]\na_n = (1/π) * [0 - (1/n^2) * (-cos(nx))(-π to π)]\na_n = (1/π) * (2/n^2) * [(-1)^n - 1]\na_n = 0 for even n, and a_n = (-2/πn^2) for odd n\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] x * sin(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * [(x * (-1/n) * cos(nx))(-π to π) - ∫[-π to π] (-1/n) * cos(nx) dx]\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-2π/n) + (1/n^2) * sin(nx)(-π to π)]\nb_n = (2/πn) for all n\n\nNow we have the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x:\n\nf(x) = Σ [((-1)^n * 2/πn^2) * cos(nx) + (2/πn) * sin(nx)]\n\nTo evaluate the sum of the series at x = π/2, we plug in x = π/2:\n\nf(π/2) = Σ [((-1)^n * 2/πn^2) * cos(nπ/2) + (2/πn) * sin(nπ/2)]\n\nNotice that cos(nπ/2) = 0 for odd n and sin(nπ/2) = 1 for odd n, and cos(nπ/2) = (-1)^((n-1)/2) for even n and sin(nπ/2) = 0 for even n. Therefore, the series simplifies to:\n\nf(π/2) = Σ [(2/πn) * sin(nπ/2)] for odd n\n\nf(π/2) = (2/π) * (sin(π/2) + sin(3π/2)/3 + sin(5π/2)/5 + ...)\n\nf(π/2) = (2/π) * (1 + (-1/3) + (1/5) + (-1/7) + ...)\n\nThis is an alternating series, and it converges to π/4:\n\nf(π/2) = π/4"
