    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to maximize its profits by producing two types of products, product X and product Y. The production process of both products involves the use of a limited amount of resources such as raw materials and labor hours. The manufacturing company has a total of 500 units of the resource available for production each day, out of which product X requires 2 units of resources for each unit of product and product Y requires 3 units of resources per unit. \n\nGiven that the company wants to maximize its profits, the sales revenue for each unit of product X is $200 and for each unit of product Y is $150. Also, the company cannot produce negative amounts of either product. Determine the optimal production quantities of product X and product Y that the company can produce each day while maximizing profits subject to the available resources.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 200x + 150y, subject to the constraint 2x + 3y ≤ 500, and x, y ≥ 0.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraint:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 500\ny ≤ (500 - 2x) / 3\n\nThe feasible region is the area below the line y = (500 - 2x) / 3 and above the x and y axes.\n\nNow we need to find the corner points of the feasible region, which are the points where the constraint line intersects the axes:\n\n1. Intersection with the x-axis (y = 0):\n2x + 3(0) ≤ 500\nx ≤ 250\nSo the first corner point is (250, 0).\n\n2. Intersection with the y-axis (x = 0):\n2(0) + 3y ≤ 500\ny ≤ 500 / 3 ≈ 166.67\nSo the second corner point is (0, 166.67).\n\n3. Intersection of the constraint line with both axes:\n2x + 3y = 500\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the third corner point:\n\n2x + 3y = 500\nx = 250 - (3/2)y\n\nSubstitute x into the second equation:\n\n250 - (3/2)y + 3y = 500\n(3/2)y = 250\ny = 100\n\nNow substitute y back into the first equation:\n\nx = 250 - (3/2)(100)\nx = 250 - 150\nx = 100\n\nSo the third corner point is (100, 100).\n\nNow we need to evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 200x + 150y at each of these corner points:\n\nP(250, 0) = 200(250) + 150(0) = 50,000\nP(0, 166.67) = 200(0) + 150(166.67) ≈ 25,000.50\nP(100, 100) = 200(100) + 150(100) = 35,000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the corner point (250, 0), with a profit of $50,000. Therefore, the company should produce 250 units of product X and 0 units of product Y to maximize its profits."
