    "message_2": "To find a number that is both a square number and a triangular number, we need to find a number x such that S(x) and T(x) are both true.\n\nA square number is a number that can be represented as the product of an integer with itself, i.e., x = n^2 for some integer n.\n\nA triangular number is a number that can be represented as the sum of the first m natural numbers, i.e., x = m(m+1)/2 for some integer m.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest x that satisfies both conditions.\n\nLet's start by listing the first few square numbers and triangular numbers:\n\nSquare numbers: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, ...\nTriangular numbers: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, ...\n\nWe can see that 1 is both a square number (1^2) and a triangular number (1(1+1)/2). So, the smallest number that is both a square number and a triangular number is 1."
