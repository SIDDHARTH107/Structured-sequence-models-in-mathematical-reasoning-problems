    "message_2": "Let x be an element in G with order 9. By definition, this means that x^9 = e and x^k ≠ e for any k < 9. Since the order of G is 9, there are 9 elements in G. We will now show that the set {e, x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5, x^6, x^7, x^8} contains all elements of G, which would imply that G is a cyclic group generated by x and is isomorphic to C9.\n\nFirst, we show that all elements in the set are distinct. Suppose for some integers i, j (0 ≤ i, j ≤ 8) with i ≠ j, we have x^i = x^j. Without loss of generality, assume i < j. Then, we can multiply both sides by (x^i)^(-1) (which exists since G is a group), and we get x^(j-i) = e. But this contradicts the fact that x has order 9, as j - i would be a positive integer less than 9. Therefore, all elements in the set are distinct.\n\nNow, since G has 9 elements and the set {e, x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5, x^6, x^7, x^8} has 9 distinct elements, it must contain all elements of G. Thus, G is generated by x and is a cyclic group.\n\nFinally, we need to show that G is isomorphic to C9. Define a mapping φ: G → C9 such that φ(x^i) = i mod 9 for all i = 0, 1, ..., 8. We will show that φ is an isomorphism.\n\n1. φ is well-defined: Since G is generated by x, every element in G can be written as x^i for some i, and thus φ is well-defined.\n\n2. φ is a homomorphism: Let a, b ∈ G, so a = x^i and b = x^j for some i, j. Then, φ(ab) = φ(x^i * x^j) = φ(x^(i+j)) = (i + j) mod 9 = (i mod 9) + (j mod 9) = φ(x^i) + φ(x^j) = φ(a) + φ(b).\n\n3. φ is injective: Suppose φ(a) = φ(b) for some a, b ∈ G. Then, a = x^i and b = x^j for some i, j, and φ(x^i) = φ(x^j). This implies i mod 9 = j mod 9, which means i = j. Thus, a = b, and φ is injective.\n\n4. φ is surjective: For any k ∈ C9, there exists an element x^k ∈ G such that φ(x^k) = k mod 9. Thus, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a well-defined homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C9."
