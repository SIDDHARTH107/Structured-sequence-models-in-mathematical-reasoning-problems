    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll first differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x using the chain rule.\n\nGiven equation: y^2 + 2yx = 4\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd(y^2)/dx + d(2yx)/dx = d(4)/dx\n\nUsing the chain rule, we have:\n\n2y(dy/dx) + 2(dy/dx)x + 2y = 0\n\nNow, we'll solve for dy/dx:\n\n2y(dy/dx) + 2x(dy/dx) = -2y\n\nFactor out dy/dx:\n\n(dy/dx)(2y + 2x) = -2y\n\nNow, divide both sides by (2y + 2x) to isolate dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = -2y / (2y + 2x)\n\nWe need to find the value of y when x = 1. Substitute x = 1 into the original equation:\n\ny^2 + 2y(1) = 4\n\ny^2 + 2y - 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = -4:\n\ny = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(-4))) / 2(1)\n\ny = (-2 ± √(20)) / 2\n\nThere are two possible values for y: y = (-2 + √20)/2 and y = (-2 - √20)/2. We'll use both values to find the corresponding values of dy/dx.\n\nFor y = (-2 + √20)/2:\n\ndy/dx = -2((-2 + √20)/2) / (2((-2 + √20)/2) + 2(1))\n\ndy/dx = (-2 + √20) / (2 + √20)\n\nFor y = (-2 - √20)/2:\n\ndy/dx = -2((-2 - √20)/2) / (2((-2 - √20)/2) + 2(1))\n\ndy/dx = (-2 - √20) / (-2 + √20)\n\nSo, there are two possible values for the derivative of y with respect to x when x = 1:\n\ndy/dx = (-2 + √20) / (2 + √20) or dy/dx = (-2 - √20) / (-2 + √20)"
