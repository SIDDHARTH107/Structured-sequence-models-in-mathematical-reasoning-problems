    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator of $\\omega$ with respect to $M$, we first need to choose an orientation and a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$. Let $(e_1, e_2, e_3)$ be an oriented orthonormal basis of the tangent space at each point of $M$ with respect to the metric $g$. Let $\\omega_i$ be the dual basis of 1-forms, i.e., $\\omega_i(e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nNow, let's express the volume form $\\omega$ in terms of the dual basis $\\omega_i$. Since $\\omega$ is a 3-form on a 3-dimensional manifold, it can be written as:\n\n$\\omega = f \\omega_1 \\wedge \\omega_2 \\wedge \\omega_3$,\n\nwhere $f$ is a scalar function on $M$. Since $\\omega$ vanishes along the 2-dimensional submanifold $N$, the function $f$ must vanish on $N$ as well.\n\nThe Hodge star operator acts on the volume form $\\omega$ as follows:\n\n$*\\omega = \\frac{1}{3!}g^{ij}g^{kl}g^{mn}\\omega_{imn}\\epsilon_{jkl}$,\n\nwhere $g^{ij}$ are the components of the inverse metric tensor, $\\omega_{imn}$ are the components of the 3-form $\\omega$, and $\\epsilon_{jkl}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol.\n\nIn our case, the components of $\\omega$ are given by $\\omega_{123} = f$, and all other components are zero. Therefore, the Hodge star operator simplifies to:\n\n$*\\omega = g^{11}g^{22}g^{33}\\omega_{123}\\epsilon_{123} = f$.\n\nThus, the Hodge star operator of $\\omega$ with respect to $M$ is the scalar function $f$ that vanishes along the 2-dimensional submanifold $N$."
