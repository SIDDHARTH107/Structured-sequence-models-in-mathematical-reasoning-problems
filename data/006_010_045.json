    "message_1": "In a certain town, 30% of the population are over the age of 60. If a new disease affects 5% of the over-60 population, what is the probability that a randomly selected town resident is over 60 and affected by the disease?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected town resident is over 60 and affected by the disease, we need to multiply the probability of being over 60 by the probability of being affected by the disease given that the person is over 60.\n\nProbability of being over 60 = 30% = 0.30\nProbability of being affected by the disease given over 60 = 5% = 0.05\n\nProbability of being over 60 and affected by the disease = 0.30 * 0.05 = 0.015\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected town resident is over 60 and affected by the disease is 0.015 or 1.5%."
