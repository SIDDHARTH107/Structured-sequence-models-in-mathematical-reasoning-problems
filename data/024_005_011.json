    "message_1": "Consider the surface given by the equation: \n\nz = x^2 + y^2\n\nWhat are the principal curvatures at the point (0,0,0)?",
    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures at the point (0,0,0) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface by using the coordinates (u, v) = (x, y). Then, the position vector of the surface is given by:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we find the second partial derivatives:\n\nr_uu = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 2)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNext, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = r_uu • N = 2\nM = r_uv • N = 2\nN = r_vv • N = 2\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface. Now, we can find the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) using the first and second fundamental forms. The principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the shape operator matrix, which is given by:\n\nS = (1/EG - F^2) * | L M |\n                         | M N |\n\nAt the point (0,0,0), we have:\n\nE = 1, F = 0, G = 1, L = 2, M = 2, N = 2\n\nSo, the shape operator matrix is:\n\nS = | 2 2 |\n      | 2 2 |\n\nNow, we find the eigenvalues of this matrix, which are the principal curvatures:\n\nThe characteristic equation is given by:\n\ndet(S - λI) = (2 - λ)^2 - 4 = 0\n\nSolving for λ, we get:\n\nλ^2 - 4λ = 0\nλ(λ - 4) = 0\n\nThe eigenvalues (principal curvatures) are:\n\nk1 = 0\nk2 = 4\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (0,0,0) are 0 and 4."
