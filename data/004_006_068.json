    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = 6x^2 - 5x + 2, we first need to find its derivative with respect to x.\n\nf'(x) = d(6x^2 - 5x + 2)/dx\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 12x - 5\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x for which f'(x) = 0, as the critical points occur when the derivative is zero or undefined. In this case, the derivative is a linear function, so it will never be undefined. We just need to solve for f'(x) = 0:\n\n12x - 5 = 0\n\nAdd 5 to both sides:\n\n12x = 5\n\nNow, divide by 12:\n\nx = 5/12\n\nSo, there is one critical point at x = 5/12."
