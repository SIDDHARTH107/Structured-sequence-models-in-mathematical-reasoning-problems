    "message_2": "To find the probability of a person attending the social event, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of people who have confirmed their attendance, which is 10. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of people in the community, which is 20.\n\nSo, the probability of a person attending the social event is:\n\nProbability = 10 / 20\n\nProbability = 1 / 2\n\nTherefore, the probability of a person attending the social event is 1/2 or 50%."
