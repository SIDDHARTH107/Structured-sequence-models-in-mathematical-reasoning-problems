    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. At each level, the number of smaller tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the total number of smaller tetrahedra needed to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron of level 4, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedra = (4^0) + (4^1) + (4^2) + (4^3) + (4^4)\n\nHere, the exponent represents the level of the Sierpinski tetrahedron.\n\nTotal number of smaller tetrahedra = 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 = 341\n\nSo, 341 smaller tetrahedra are needed to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron of level 4."
