    "message_1": "Let X and Y be two algebraic varieties and f: X → Y be a morphism of algebraic varieties. If we have a complex of coherent sheaves F• on X, then the pushforward f∗F• is a complex of coherent sheaves on Y. If we further assume that F• is perfect, then f∗F• is also perfect.\n\nSuppose X and Y are projective varieties and f is a closed immersion. Let E be a locally free sheaf on X. Show that f∗E is isomorphic to a direct summand of a locally free sheaf on Y.",
    "message_2": "Since X and Y are projective varieties, we can assume that they are embedded in some projective spaces P^n and P^m, respectively. Let i: X → P^n and j: Y → P^m be the corresponding closed immersions. Then we have the following commutative diagram:\n\n```\nX --f--> Y\n|        |\ni        j\n|        |\nv        v\nP^n --> P^m\n```\n\nNow, let E be a locally free sheaf on X. Since X is projective, E is a direct summand of a sheaf of the form i^*G for some locally free sheaf G on P^n. In other words, we have an exact sequence:\n\n```\n0 → E → i^*G → E' → 0\n```\n\nApplying the pushforward functor f_* to this exact sequence, we get:\n\n```\n0 → f_*E → f_*(i^*G) → f_*E' → 0\n```\n\nSince f is a closed immersion, we have f_*i^* = j^*f_*. Therefore, we have:\n\n```\n0 → f_*E → j^*(f_*G) → f_*E' → 0\n```\n\nNow, f_*G is a locally free sheaf on Y since G is locally free on P^n and f is a closed immersion. Moreover, j^* is an exact functor, so j^*(f_*G) is also locally free on Y. Thus, f_*E is a direct summand of a locally free sheaf on Y, as required."
