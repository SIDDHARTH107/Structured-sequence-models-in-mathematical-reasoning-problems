    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nABC is a triangle in which AB = 5, AC = 6, and BC = 7. Find the measure of angle B using the law of cosines.",
    "message_2": "To find the measure of angle B using the law of cosines, we can use the formula:\n\ncos(B) = (AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2) / (2 * AB * BC)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\ncos(B) = (5^2 + 7^2 - 6^2) / (2 * 5 * 7)\ncos(B) = (25 + 49 - 36) / 70\ncos(B) = 38 / 70\ncos(B) = 19 / 35\n\nNow, to find the measure of angle B, we need to find the inverse cosine (arccos) of 19/35:\n\nB = arccos(19/35)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nB ≈ 56.4°\n\nSo, the measure of angle B is approximately 56.4 degrees."
