    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude and period of the function y = 3cos(2x + π/4), we need to analyze the coefficients and constants inside the cosine function.\n\nAmplitude:\nThe amplitude of a cosine function is the absolute value of the coefficient in front of the cosine function. In this case, the amplitude is |3| = 3.\n\nPeriod:\nThe period of a cosine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the cosine function. The general formula for the period of a cosine function is (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of the x term. In this case, B = 2. So, the period is (2π) / |2| = (2π) / 2 = π.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the function y = 3cos(2x + π/4) is 3, and the period is π."
