    "message_2": "To find the value of Euler's totient function for 21, we first need to find the prime factors of 21. The prime factors of 21 are 3 and 7, since 21 = 3 × 7.\n\nEuler's totient function, φ(n), can be calculated using the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n × (1 - 1/p1) × (1 - 1/p2) × ... × (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nIn our case, n = 21, p1 = 3, and p2 = 7. So, we can calculate φ(21) as follows:\n\nφ(21) = 21 × (1 - 1/3) × (1 - 1/7)\nφ(21) = 21 × (2/3) × (6/7)\nφ(21) = (21 × 2 × 6) / (3 × 7)\nφ(21) = 252 / 21\nφ(21) = 12\n\nTherefore, there are 12 integers between 1 and 21 (inclusive) that are relatively prime to 21."
