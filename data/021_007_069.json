    "message_2": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method used to find the roots of a real-valued function. The formula for the method is:\n\nx_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the current approximation, f(x_n) is the value of the function at x_n, and f'(x_n) is the value of the derivative of the function at x_n.\n\nGiven the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x + 9, we first need to find its derivative:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 5\n\nNow, we will apply the Newton-Raphson method using the initial approximation x0 = 1.5:\n\n1. Calculate f(x0) and f'(x0):\n\nf(1.5) = (1.5)^3 - 5(1.5) + 9 = 3.375 - 7.5 + 9 = 4.875\nf'(1.5) = 3(1.5)^2 - 5 = 6.75 - 5 = 1.75\n\n2. Update the approximation:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) = 1.5 - 4.875 / 1.75 ≈ 1.2136\n\n3. Repeat the process until the desired accuracy is achieved (four decimal places in this case):\n\nx2 = x1 - f(x1) / f'(x1)\nx3 = x2 - f(x2) / f'(x2)\n...\n\nAfter several iterations, we find that the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 5x + 9, correct to four decimal places, is approximately x ≈ 1.2136."
