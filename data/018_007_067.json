    "message_2": "To find the size of the power set of A, we need to determine the number of possible subsets of A. A set with n elements has 2^n subsets, including the empty set and the set itself. In this case, A has 4 elements, so the size of its power set is 2^4 = 16.\n\nNow, let's prove that the size of the power set of A is always larger than the size of A itself. Let A be a set with n elements. The size of A's power set is 2^n, as mentioned earlier. We want to show that 2^n > n for all n.\n\nFor n = 0, we have 2^0 = 1, which is greater than 0.\nFor n = 1, we have 2^1 = 2, which is greater than 1.\n\nNow, let's assume that 2^k > k for some positive integer k. We want to show that 2^(k+1) > (k+1).\n\n2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k > 2 * k (since 2^k > k by our assumption)\n2 * k >= k + k (since k is a positive integer)\nSo, 2 * 2^k >= k + k > k + 1.\n\nThus, 2^(k+1) > (k+1). By the principle of mathematical induction, we have shown that the size of the power set of A is always larger than the size of A itself for all non-negative integers n."
