    "message_2": "To solve the system of equations using Gaussian elimination, we first write the augmented matrix of the system:\n\n```\n| 2 -1  3 | 11 |\n| 1  2 -4 | -3 |\n| 3 -1  2 |  5 |\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate the first variable (x) from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply the first row by 1/2 and subtract it from the second row, and multiply the first row by -3/2 and add it to the third row:\n\n```\n| 2 -1  3 | 11 |\n| 0  5/2 -5 | -11/2 |\n| 0  1/2  1 | -1/2 |\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the second variable (y) from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we can multiply the second row by 1/5 and add it to the third row:\n\n```\n| 2 -1  3 | 11 |\n| 0  5/2 -5 | -11/2 |\n| 0  0  3 | -3 |\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for the third variable (z).\n\nNow we have a triangular system, and we can solve for z using back-substitution:\n\n```\n3z = -3\nz = -1\n```\n\nStep 4: Solve for the second variable (y).\n\nSubstitute the value of z back into the second equation:\n\n```\n(5/2)y - 5(-1) = -11/2\n(5/2)y + 5 = -11/2\n(5/2)y = -21/2\ny = -21/5\n```\n\nStep 5: Solve for the first variable (x).\n\nSubstitute the values of y and z back into the first equation:\n\n```\n2x - (-21/5) + 3(-1) = 11\n2x + 21/5 - 3 = 11\n2x = 11 - 21/5 + 3\n2x = 56/5\nx = 28/5\n```\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is:\n\n```\nx = 28/5\ny = -21/5\nz = -1\n```"
