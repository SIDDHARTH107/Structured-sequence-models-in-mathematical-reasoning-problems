    "message_1": "Let X be a non-singular projective variety with a hyperplane section H. Let L be an ample line bundle on X, such that L is not numerically equivalent to a multiple of H. Suppose that there exists a curve C on X such that C is not contained in any fiber of the rational map induced by the linear system |mL - nH| for any positive integers m and n. Compute the degree of C on X.",
    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the curve C on X, we need to find the intersection number of C with a suitable divisor class. Since C is not contained in any fiber of the rational map induced by the linear system |mL - nH|, we can consider the intersection of C with a general element D in this linear system.\n\nLet's denote the intersection number of C with D as (C.D). By the projection formula, we have:\n\n(C.D) = (C.(mL - nH)) = m(C.L) - n(C.H),\n\nwhere (C.L) and (C.H) are the intersection numbers of C with L and H, respectively.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of (C.L) and (C.H). Since L is an ample line bundle, there exists a positive integer k such that kL is very ample. Let's fix such a k. Then, the linear system |kL| defines an embedding of X into some projective space P^N. Under this embedding, the curve C is mapped to a curve C' in P^N, and the hyperplane section H corresponds to the intersection of X with a hyperplane H' in P^N.\n\nThe degree of C' in P^N is given by the intersection number (C'.H'), which is equal to (C.H) by the projection formula. To compute (C'.H'), we can use the fact that the degree of a curve in projective space is equal to the number of intersection points of the curve with a general hyperplane, counted with multiplicities. Since C' is not contained in any fiber of the rational map induced by the linear system |mL - nH|, it intersects H' transversally in a finite number of points. Let's denote this number as d. Then, we have:\n\n(C.H) = d.\n\nTo compute (C.L), we can use the fact that L is numerically equivalent to aH + bL for some integers a and b, with b not equal to zero. Then, we have:\n\n(C.L) = (C.(aH + bL)) = a(C.H) + b(C.L) = ad + b(C.L).\n\nSince b is not equal to zero, we can solve for (C.L):\n\n(C.L) = ad / (1 - b).\n\nNow, we can compute the degree of C on X:\n\n(C.D) = m(C.L) - n(C.H) = m(ad / (1 - b)) - nd = (mad - nbd) / (1 - b).\n\nSince the degree of a curve is always a non-negative integer, we conclude that the degree of C on X is:\n\nDegree(C) = (mad - nbd) / (1 - b)."
