    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 3x + 5 ≤ 14, we'll first isolate the variable x by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n   3x + 5 - 5 ≤ 14 - 5\n   3x ≤ 9\n\n2. Divide both sides by 3:\n   3x / 3 ≤ 9 / 3\n   x ≤ 3\n\nSo the solutions of the inequality are all real numbers x such that x ≤ 3. On the number line, this would be represented by a closed circle at 3 (since it includes the value 3) and an arrow pointing to the left, indicating all values less than or equal to 3."
