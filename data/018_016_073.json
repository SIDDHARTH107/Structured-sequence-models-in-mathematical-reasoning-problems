However, this does not prove that the Cartesian product of two sets is commutative with respect to union, as we are only comparing the union of the Cartesian products, not the Cartesian products themselves.\n\nTo show that the Cartesian product is not commutative, we can compare A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, as their elements are different. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
