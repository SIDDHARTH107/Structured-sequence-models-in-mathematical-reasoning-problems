    "message_2": "To find the geodesic curve on the surface $z = x^2 + y^2$, we need to minimize the length of the curve between the given points $(-1,0,1)$ and $(1,0,1)$. We can parameterize the curve as $\\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), x^2(t) + y^2(t))$ with $t \\in [0,1]$ and the boundary conditions $x(0) = -1$, $y(0) = 0$, $x(1) = 1$, and $y(1) = 0$.\n\nThe length of the curve can be expressed as:\n\n$$L = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{d(x^2 + y^2)}{dt}\\right)^2} dt$$\n\nUsing the chain rule, we can rewrite the last term as:\n\n$$\\frac{d(x^2 + y^2)}{dt} = 2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt}$$\n\nNow, the length of the curve becomes:\n\n$$L = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^2 + (2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt})^2} dt$$\n\nTo minimize this length, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations. Let $F(x, y, x', y') = \\sqrt{x'^2 + y'^2 + (2xx' + 2yy')^2}$, where $x' = \\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $y' = \\frac{dy}{dt}$. Then the Euler-Lagrange equations are:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} - \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x'}\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'}\\right) = 0$$\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = \\frac{4x(x'^2 + y'^2 + (2xx' + 2yy')^2)}{F}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x'} = \\frac{2x'(1 + 4x^2) + 8xy(2xx' + 2yy')}{F}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = \\frac{4y(x'^2 + y'^2 + (2xx' + 2yy')^2)}{F}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = \\frac{2y'(1 + 4y^2) + 8xy(2xx' + 2yy')}{F}$$\n\nPlugging these into the Euler-Lagrange equations and simplifying, we obtain the following system of differential equations:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{2x'(1 + 4x^2) + 8xy(2xx' + 2yy')}{F}\\right) = \\frac{4x(x'^2 + y'^2 + (2xx' + 2yy')^2)}{F}$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{2y'(1 + 4y^2) + 8xy(2xx' + 2yy')}{F}\\right) = \\frac{4y(x'^2 + y'^2 + (2xx' + 2yy')^2)}{F}$$\n\nThis system of differential equations is quite complicated and does not have a simple closed-form solution. However, we can make some observations to simplify the problem.\n\nSince the surface is rotationally symmetric about the z-axis, we can expect the geodesic curve to be symmetric with respect to the xz-plane. Therefore, we can assume that the curve lies in the xz-plane, which means $y(t) = 0$ for all $t$. This simplifies the problem to finding the geodesic curve on the surface $z = x^2$ between the points $(-1,1)$ and $(1,1)$.\n\nNow, the curve can be parameterized as $\\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), x^2(t))$, and the length of the curve is given by:\n\n$$L = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{d(x^2)}{dt}\\right)^2} dt = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 + (2x\\frac{dx}{dt})^2} dt$$\n\nLet $u(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt}$. Then, the length of the curve becomes:\n\n$$L = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{u^2 + (2xu)^2} dt$$\n\nTo minimize this length, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations again. Let $G(x, u) = \\sqrt{u^2 + (2xu)^2}$. Then the Euler-Lagrange equation is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x} - \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u}\\right) = 0$$\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x} = \\frac{8x^2u^2}{G}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} = \\frac{u(1 + 4x^2)}{G}$$\n\nPlugging these into the Euler-Lagrange equation and simplifying, we obtain the following differential equation:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{u(1 + 4x^2)}{G}\\right) = \\frac{8x^2u^2}{G}$$\n\nThis differential equation is still quite complicated, but we can make a further simplification by noting that the geodesic curve on the surface $z = x^2$ should be a straight line in the xz-plane. This is because the surface is a paraboloid, and a straight line is the shortest path between two points in a plane.\n\nTherefore, the geodesic curve connecting the points $(-1,0,1)$ and $(1,0,1)$ on the surface $z = x^2 + y^2$ is given by the straight line in the xz-plane:\n\n$$z = x^2, \\quad y = 0$$\n\nwith $x \\in [-1, 1]$."
