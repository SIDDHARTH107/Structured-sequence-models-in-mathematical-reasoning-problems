    "message_2": "To simplify the expression $\\sqrt{125}$, we look for the prime factors of 125 and then simplify the square root.\n\nThe prime factorization of 125 is $5^3$ (since $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125$).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$\\sqrt{5^3}$\n\nAccording to the properties of square roots, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$(5^{\\frac{3}{2}})$\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n$5^{\\frac{3}{2}}$"
