    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A $\\bigtriangleup$ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA $\\bigtriangleup$ B = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the union of (A $\\bigtriangleup$ B) and B:\n\n(A $\\bigtriangleup$ B) $\\cup$ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNext, let's find the union of A and B:\n\nA $\\cup$ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A $\\cup$ B) and B:\n\n(A $\\cup$ B) $\\bigtriangleup$ B = {1, 2}\n\nNow, we need to verify that the result satisfies the distributive property of the symmetric difference over union. The distributive property states that:\n\n(A $\\bigtriangleup$ B) $\\cup$ B = (A $\\cup$ B) $\\bigtriangleup$ B\n\nWe have already found both sides of the equation:\n\n(A $\\bigtriangleup$ B) $\\cup$ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n(A $\\cup$ B) $\\bigtriangleup$ B = {1, 2}\n\nThese two sets are not equal, so the distributive property of the symmetric difference over union does not hold for these sets A and B."
