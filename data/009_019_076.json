    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nConsider the stochastic differential equation given by dX(t) = a*X(t) dt + b*X(t) dW(t) where W(t) is Brownian motion and a = 1 and b = 2. If X(0) = 5 and we wish to simulate the process until time T = 2, what is the expected value and variance of X(2)?",
    "message_2": "This stochastic differential equation is a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. For a GBM model, the solution of the stochastic differential equation is given by:\n\nX(t) = X(0) * exp((a - (b^2)/2) * t + b * W(t))\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 2, and X(0) = 5. We want to find the expected value and variance of X(2).\n\nExpected value of X(t) is given by:\n\nE[X(t)] = X(0) * exp(a * t)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nE[X(2)] = 5 * exp(1 * 2) = 5 * exp(2) ≈ 36.945\n\nNow, let's find the variance of X(t). The variance is given by:\n\nVar[X(t)] = (X(0)^2) * exp(2 * a * t) * (exp(b^2 * t) - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nVar[X(2)] = (5^2) * exp(2 * 1 * 2) * (exp(2^2 * 2) - 1) = 25 * exp(4) * (exp(8) - 1) ≈ 2915.293\n\nSo, the expected value of X(2) is approximately 36.945, and the variance of X(2) is approximately 2915.293."
