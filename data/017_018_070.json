We can classify them based on their structure and the number of generators.\n\n1. Cyclic group: C_32 (1 generator)\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_2 x C_16 (2 generators)\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups: C_4 x C_8 (2 generators)\n4. Direct product of three cyclic groups: C_2 x C_2 x C_8 (3 generators)\n5. Direct product of three cyclic groups: C_2 x C_4 x C_4 (3 generators)\n6. Direct product of four cyclic groups: C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_4 (4 generators)\n7. Direct product of five cyclic groups: C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_2 (5 generators)\n\nFor the remaining non-isomorphic groups, we can list them based on the number of generators and their structure:\n\n8-10. 2 generators: 3 groups with a cyclic subgroup of index 2\n11-17. 2 generators: 7 groups with a cyclic subgroup of index 4\n18-29. 3 generators: 12 groups with a cyclic subgroup of index 2\n30-38. 3 generators: 9 groups with a cyclic subgroup of index 4\n39-51. 4 generators: 13 groups with a cyclic subgroup of index 2\n\nIn total, there are 51 non-isomorphic groups of order 32."
