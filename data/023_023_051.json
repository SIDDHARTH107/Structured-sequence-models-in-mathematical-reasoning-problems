    "message_1": "A networking engineer wants to analyze the behavior of a communication system that transmits data at 5000 bits per second (bps). The system has a bandwidth of 2000 Hz. Using the Fourier transform, determine the maximum number of harmonics that need to be included to accurately analyze the system.",
    "message_2": "To determine the maximum number of harmonics that need to be included to accurately analyze the system, we can use the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The theorem states that the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency component in the signal to accurately reconstruct the signal.\n\nIn this case, the highest frequency component is the bandwidth of the system, which is 2000 Hz. Therefore, the minimum sampling rate required is 2 * 2000 Hz = 4000 samples per second.\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between the data rate (5000 bps) and the number of harmonics. Since each harmonic represents a frequency component, we can divide the data rate by the bandwidth to find the number of harmonics:\n\nNumber of harmonics = Data rate / Bandwidth\nNumber of harmonics = 5000 bps / 2000 Hz\nNumber of harmonics = 2.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a harmonic, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of harmonics that need to be included to accurately analyze the system is 3."
