    "message_1": "A circle with a radius of 5 cm has a central angle of 60 degrees. Find the area of the sector formed by the central angle.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector formed by the central angle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) × π × r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius r = 5 cm and the central angle = 60 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (60 / 360) × π × 5²\nArea of sector = (1/6) × π × 25\nArea of sector = (25π)/6\n\nTherefore, the area of the sector formed by the central angle is (25π)/6 square centimeters."
