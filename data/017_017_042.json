    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 30. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_3 divides the index of the Sylow 3-subgroup in G, which is 30/3 = 10.\n2. n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nThe divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The only divisor that satisfies the second condition is n_3 = 1. Therefore, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which we will denote by P_3.\n\nSince P_3 is the unique Sylow 3-subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup of G. Now, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups of G. Let n_5 be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_5 divides the index of the Sylow 5-subgroup in G, which is 30/5 = 6.\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nThe divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The only divisor that satisfies the second condition is n_5 = 1. Therefore, G has a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which we will denote by P_5.\n\nSince P_5 is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup of G. Now, we have two normal subgroups P_3 and P_5 with orders 3 and 5, respectively. Since the orders of P_3 and P_5 are relatively prime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., P_3 ∩ P_5 = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, consider the product of P_3 and P_5, denoted by P_3P_5. Since P_3 and P_5 are both normal in G, their product P_3P_5 is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, the order of P_3P_5 is |P_3||P_5|/|P_3 ∩ P_5| = 3 * 5 / 1 = 15. Therefore, P_3P_5 is a subgroup of G of order 15.\n\nSince G has order 30 and P_3P_5 has order 15, the index of P_3P_5 in G is 2. By the normalizer-centralizer theorem, the normalizer of P_3P_5 in G is equal to its centralizer, i.e., N_G(P_3P_5) = C_G(P_3P_5). Since the index of P_3P_5 in G is 2, it follows that P_3P_5 is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, we have a normal subgroup P_3P_5 of G with order 15. The quotient group G/P_3P_5 has order 30/15 = 2. Since there is only one group of order 2, G/P_3P_5 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C2.\n\nBy the correspondence theorem, there is a subgroup H of G such that H/P_3P_5 is isomorphic to C2. Since the order of H is 2 * 15 = 30, H must be equal to G. Therefore, G is an extension of the cyclic group C2 by the normal subgroup P_3P_5.\n\nNow, we have three possibilities for G:\n\n1. G is the direct product of P_3 and P_5, i.e., G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30.\n2. G is the semidirect product of P_3 and P_5, where the action of C2 on P_3P_5 is trivial, i.e., G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15.\n3. G is the semidirect product of P_3 and P_5, where the action of C2 on P_3P_5 is non-trivial, i.e., G is a non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30."
