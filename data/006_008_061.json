    "message_2": "The probability of an event not occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event occurring. In this case, the probability of it not raining on a randomly chosen day in May is:\n\n1 - 0.30 = 0.70\n\nSo, there is a 70% chance that it will not rain on a randomly chosen day in May."
