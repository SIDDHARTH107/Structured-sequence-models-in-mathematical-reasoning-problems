    "message_1": "Suppose we want to test the claim that the mean temperature in a certain city in July is equal to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. A sample of 25 days gives a mean temperature of 82 degrees Fahrenheit with a standard deviation of 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nWhat is the p-value of this test, given that the population distribution is normal with unknown population mean and standard deviation? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the p-value, we will first find the test statistic (t-score) using the formula:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nt = (82 - 85) / (2.5 / sqrt(25))\nt = (-3) / (2.5 / 5)\nt = -3 / 0.5\nt = -6\n\nNow, we will use the t-distribution table or a calculator to find the p-value associated with this t-score. Since we are conducting a two-tailed test (we want to test if the mean temperature is equal to 85 degrees, not just greater or lesser), we will look for the probability in both tails.\n\nUsing a t-distribution table or calculator with 24 degrees of freedom (sample size - 1), we find that the p-value associated with a t-score of -6 is very close to 0 (less than 0.0001).\n\nSince the p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the mean temperature in the city in July is equal to 85 degrees Fahrenheit."
