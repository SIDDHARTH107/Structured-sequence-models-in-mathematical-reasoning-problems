The student then walks 50 meters away from the building and measures the angle of elevation to be 30 degrees. How tall is the building? Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the height of the building as h and the distance from the student to the building when they first measured the angle as x. We can set up two right triangles to represent the problem:\n\nTriangle 1: The student at the base of the building (angle of elevation 60 degrees)\n- Opposite side (height of the building) = h\n- Adjacent side (distance from the student to the building) = x\n\nTriangle 2: The student 50 meters away from the building (angle of elevation 30 degrees)\n- Opposite side (height of the building) = h\n- Adjacent side (distance from the student to the building) = x + 50\n\nNow, we can use the tangent function to set up equations for both triangles:\n\nTriangle 1: tan(60) = h/x\nTriangle 2: tan(30) = h/(x + 50)\n\nWe know that tan(60) = √3 and tan(30) = 1/√3. Substituting these values into the equations, we get:\n\n√3 = h/x (1)\n1/√3 = h/(x + 50) (2)\n\nNow, we can solve for h in equation (1) and substitute it into equation (2):\n\nh = x√3 (3)\n\nSubstituting equation (3) into equation (2):\n\n1/√3 = (x√3)/(x + 50)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx + 50 = 3x\n2x = 50\nx = 25\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into equation (3) to find the height of the building:\n\nh = 25√3\nh ≈ 43.30 meters\n\nSo, the height of the building is approximately 43.30 meters."
