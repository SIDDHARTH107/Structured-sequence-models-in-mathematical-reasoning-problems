    "message_1": "Suppose we have intercepted a message encrypted using the Playfair cipher, and we know that the key used was a 5x5 matrix with the following arrangement of letters:\n\n    F G C R Y\n    L M A U H\n    Q B D E K\n    N O S T W\n    X Z V I P\n\nDecrypt the message \"PYOWGVRYYLX\" using the Playfair cipher with the given key.",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message \"PYOWGVRYYLX\" using the Playfair cipher with the given key, we first need to divide the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). Since the message has an even number of letters, we don't need to add any extra letters.\n\nDigraphs: PY OW GV RY YL X\n\nNow, we will decrypt each digraph using the given key matrix:\n\n1. PY: P is in row 5 and column 5, Y is in row 1 and column 5. Since they are in the same column, we move up one row for each letter. So, P becomes X and Y becomes F. Decrypted digraph: XF\n\n2. OW: O is in row 4 and column 2, W is in row 4 and column 5. Since they are in the same row, we move left one column for each letter. So, O becomes N and W becomes T. Decrypted digraph: NT\n\n3. GV: G is in row 1 and column 2, V is in row 5 and column 3. They are in different rows and columns, so we form a rectangle with these letters and replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corners of the rectangle. G becomes C and V becomes Z. Decrypted digraph: CZ\n\n4. RY: R is in row 1 and column 4, Y is in row 1 and column 5. Since they are in the same row, we move left one column for each letter. So, R becomes C and Y becomes R. Decrypted digraph: CR\n\n5. YL: Y is in row 1 and column 5, L is in row 2 and column 1. They are in different rows and columns, so we form a rectangle with these letters and replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corners of the rectangle. Y becomes H and L becomes F. Decrypted digraph: HF\n\n6. X: Since there's only one letter left, we can't form a digraph. We will leave it as it is.\n\nThe decrypted message is: XFCZCRHF X"
