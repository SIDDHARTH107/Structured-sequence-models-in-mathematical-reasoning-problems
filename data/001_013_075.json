    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(5x + 4) + 2 = 5 for x, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the square root term.\n√(5x + 4) = 5 - 2\n√(5x + 4) = 3\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(5x + 4))^2 = 3^2\n5x + 4 = 9\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\n5x = 9 - 4\n5x = 5\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution is x = 1."
