    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, 4 players decide to contribute money to a common pool. Each player has an initial endowment of $50. The total contribution to the common pool is doubled and then divided equally among all players. If a player decides not to contribute, they keep their entire endowment. If all players contribute the entire amount, their final payoff will be $100. Assuming all players are rational, calculate the best strategy for each player and determine the Nash equilibrium of the game.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the contribution of each player as follows: Player 1 contributes x1, Player 2 contributes x2, Player 3 contributes x3, and Player 4 contributes x4. The total contribution to the common pool is x1 + x2 + x3 + x4. This amount is doubled and then divided equally among all players.\n\nThe payoff for each player can be calculated as follows:\n\nPayoff for Player 1 = 50 - x1 + 0.5 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4)\nPayoff for Player 2 = 50 - x2 + 0.5 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4)\nPayoff for Player 3 = 50 - x3 + 0.5 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4)\nPayoff for Player 4 = 50 - x4 + 0.5 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4)\n\nEach player wants to maximize their payoff. In a Nash equilibrium, no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nLet's consider the case where all players contribute their entire endowment (x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = 50). In this case, the total contribution is 200, which is doubled to 400 and then divided equally among all players. Each player receives a payoff of 100.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where one player decides not to contribute (e.g., x1 = 0). In this case, the total contribution is 150, which is doubled to 300 and then divided equally among all players. Player 1 receives a payoff of 50 + 0.5 * 300 = 200, while the other players receive a payoff of 50 - 50 + 0.5 * 300 = 100. Player 1 has increased their payoff by not contributing.\n\nGiven this, the other players will also choose not to contribute to maximize their payoffs. In the Nash equilibrium, all players contribute nothing (x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = 0), and each player's payoff is their initial endowment of $50."
