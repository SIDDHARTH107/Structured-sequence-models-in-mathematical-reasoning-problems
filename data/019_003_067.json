    "message_1": "Here is a question relating to modal logic:\n\nSuppose there are five possible worlds, and a proposition p is true in two of those worlds. What is the percentage of possible worlds in which p is true?",
    "message_2": "To find the percentage of possible worlds in which the proposition p is true, you can use the following formula:\n\n( Number of worlds where p is true / Total number of possible worlds ) * 100\n\nIn this case, p is true in 2 worlds out of 5 possible worlds. So the calculation would be:\n\n( 2 / 5 ) * 100 = 0.4 * 100 = 40%\n\nThe proposition p is true in 40% of the possible worlds."
