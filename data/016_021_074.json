    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is created by repeatedly replacing the middle third of each line segment with two segments of equal length, forming an equilateral triangle without the base. After each iteration, the total length of the curve increases by a factor of 2.\n\nLet's calculate the total length of the curve after the 5th iteration:\n\n1. After the 1st iteration, the length is 1 * 2 = 2 units.\n2. After the 2nd iteration, the length is 2 * 2 = 4 units.\n3. After the 3rd iteration, the length is 4 * 2 = 8 units.\n4. After the 4th iteration, the length is 8 * 2 = 16 units.\n5. After the 5th iteration, the length is 16 * 2 = 32 units.\n\nSo, the total length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the 5th iteration is 32 units."
