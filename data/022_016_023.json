    "message_2": "To find a conformal mapping from the interior of the square to the interior of the unit circle, we can use the Schwarz-Christoffel formula. The Schwarz-Christoffel formula for mapping the upper half-plane to a polygon is given by:\n\n$$f(z) = A \\int_0^z \\prod_{k=1}^n (w - a_k)^{-\\alpha_k} dw + B$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants, $a_k$ are the prevertices on the real line, and $\\alpha_k$ are the angles of the polygon at the corresponding vertices, divided by $\\pi$.\n\nFor our square, the angles are all $\\pi/2$, so $\\alpha_k = 1/2$ for all $k$. We can choose the prevertices to be $a_1 = -1$, $a_2 = 0$, $a_3 = 1$, and $a_4 = \\infty$. Then the integral becomes:\n\n$$f(z) = A \\int_0^z (w + 1)^{-1/2} w^{-1/2} (w - 1)^{-1/2} dw + B$$\n\nTo map the interior of the square to the interior of the unit circle, we need to find the constants $A$ and $B$. We can use the fact that the vertices of the square are mapped to the boundary of the unit circle. Let's find the image of the vertices under the mapping:\n\n1. For $z = 0$, we have $f(0) = B$. Since $(0,0)$ is mapped to the unit circle, we have $|B| = 1$.\n2. For $z = 1$, we have $f(1) = A \\int_0^1 (w + 1)^{-1/2} w^{-1/2} (w - 1)^{-1/2} dw + B$. Since $(1,0)$ is mapped to the unit circle, we have $|A \\int_0^1 (w + 1)^{-1/2} w^{-1/2} (w - 1)^{-1/2} dw + B| = 1$.\n\nNow we need to find the value of the integral:\n\n$$\\int_0^1 (w + 1)^{-1/2} w^{-1/2} (w - 1)^{-1/2} dw$$\n\nThis integral can be evaluated using a change of variables. Let $w = \\sin^2(u)$, then $dw = 2\\sin(u)\\cos(u) du$. The integral becomes:\n\n$$\\int_0^{\\pi/2} (\\sin^2(u) + 1)^{-1/2} \\sin^{-1}(u) (\\sin^2(u) - 1)^{-1/2} 2\\sin(u)\\cos(u) du$$\n\n$$= 2\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\cos(u) du$$\n\n$$= 2[\\sin(u)]_0^{\\pi/2} = 2(1 - 0) = 2$$\n\nNow we have:\n\n$$|A \\cdot 2 + B| = 1$$\n\nSince $|B| = 1$, we have two possibilities: $A = 0$ or $A = -1$. If $A = 0$, the mapping is constant, which is not conformal. Therefore, we have $A = -1$ and $B = 1$.\n\nSo the conformal mapping from the interior of the square to the interior of the unit circle is:\n\n$$f(z) = - \\int_0^z (w + 1)^{-1/2} w^{-1/2} (w - 1)^{-1/2} dw + 1$$"
