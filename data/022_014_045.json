Suppose that u(2,1) = 4 and the partial derivatives of u satisfy the following conditions:\n\n|∂u/∂x| ≤ 5, |∂u/∂y| ≤ 4   for all (x,y) in the disk.\n\nFind the maximum possible value of u(0,0) on this disk.",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum possible value of u(0,0), we can use the mean value property of harmonic functions. The mean value property states that the value of a harmonic function at a point is equal to the average value of the function on a circle centered at that point.\n\nLet's consider a circle centered at (0,0) with radius r, where 0 < r < 3. Then, the mean value property gives us:\n\nu(0,0) = (1/(2πr)) * ∫(u(r*cos(θ), r*sin(θ)) * dθ) from θ = 0 to θ = 2π\n\nNow, we can use the given information about the partial derivatives to estimate the maximum possible value of u(r*cos(θ), r*sin(θ)).\n\nBy the mean value theorem, there exists a point (x', y') on the line segment connecting (0,0) and (2,1) such that:\n\n∂u/∂x = (u(2,1) - u(0,0))/2 = 2\n\nSince |∂u/∂x| ≤ 5, this value is within the allowed range. Similarly, there exists a point (x'', y'') on the line segment connecting (0,0) and (2,1) such that:\n\n∂u/∂y = (u(2,1) - u(0,0))/1 = 4\n\nSince |∂u/∂y| ≤ 4, this value is also within the allowed range. Now, we can use these partial derivatives to estimate the maximum possible value of u(r*cos(θ), r*sin(θ)):\n\nu(r*cos(θ), r*sin(θ)) ≤ u(0,0) + 2*r*cos(θ) + 4*r*sin(θ)\n\nIntegrating this inequality with respect to θ from 0 to 2π, we get:\n\n2π*u(0,0) ≤ 2π*u(0,0) + 8π*r\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n0 ≤ 8π*r\n\nSince r > 0, this inequality is always true. Therefore, the maximum possible value of u(0,0) is achieved when the inequality is tightest, which occurs when r approaches 0. In this case, we have:\n\nu(0,0) ≤ u(2,1) + 2*2 + 4*1 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12\n\nThus, the maximum possible value of u(0,0) on this disk is 12."
