    "message_2": "To find the coordinates of the point $R = P + Q$, we need to know the equation of the elliptic curve $E$. Elliptic curves are typically given by an equation of the form:\n\n$E: y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants. Since we are not given the equation of the elliptic curve, we cannot find the exact coordinates of the point $R = P + Q$. However, we can describe the general process of adding two points on an elliptic curve.\n\nGiven two points $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ on an elliptic curve $E$, the point $R = P + Q$ can be found using the following steps:\n\n1. If $P = \\mathcal{O}$ (the point at infinity), then $R = Q$.\n2. If $Q = \\mathcal{O}$, then $R = P$.\n3. If $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 = -y_2$, then $R = \\mathcal{O}$.\n4. If $P = Q$, compute the slope $m = \\frac{3x_1^2 + A}{2y_1}$.\n5. If $P \\neq Q$, compute the slope $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.\n6. Compute the coordinates of $R = (x_3, y_3)$ using the following formulas:\n   - $x_3 = m^2 - x_1 - x_2$\n   - $y_3 = m(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$\n\nIn this case, since we do not have the equation of the elliptic curve, we cannot proceed with the calculation of the point $R = P + Q$."
