Define a Hamiltonian function H: X → R by H(x,y) = x^2 + y^2.\n \n(a) Find the Hamiltonian vector field X_H on X.\n \n(b) Find the two equilibria of X_H.\n \n(c) Show that the integral curves of X_H are periodic.\n \n(d) Compute the period of each integral curve.",
    "message_2": "(a) To find the Hamiltonian vector field X_H on X, we need to compute the differential of H, dH, and then use the symplectic form to obtain X_H. \n\nThe differential of H is given by:\n\ndH = ∂H/∂x dx + ∂H/∂y dy = (2x dx + 2y dy).\n\nNow, we use the symplectic form dx ∧ dy to compute X_H. We want to find a vector field X_H = A ∂/∂x + B ∂/∂y such that:\n\ni(X_H) (dx ∧ dy) = dH.\n\nThis means that:\n\nA dy - B dx = 2x dx + 2y dy.\n\nComparing the coefficients of dx and dy, we get:\n\nA = -2y and B = 2x.\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian vector field X_H is given by:\n\nX_H = -2y ∂/∂x + 2x ∂/∂y.\n\n(b) To find the equilibria of X_H, we need to find the points (x, y) where X_H = 0. This means that:\n\n-2y = 0 and 2x = 0.\n\nThe only solution to this system of equations is x = 0 and y = 0. Therefore, there is only one equilibrium point, which is the origin (0, 0).\n\n(c) To show that the integral curves of X_H are periodic, we can rewrite the Hamiltonian vector field as a system of first-order ordinary differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = -2y,\ndy/dt = 2x.\n\nThis system can be written as a matrix equation:\n\nd(x, y)/dt = A (x, y),\n\nwhere A is the matrix:\n\n|  0  -2 |\n|  2   0 |\n\nThe eigenvalues of A are ±2i, which are purely imaginary. This implies that the system is linearly stable and the integral curves are periodic.\n\n(d) To compute the period of each integral curve, we can use the fact that the eigenvalues of A are ±2i. The period T of a linear system with purely imaginary eigenvalues is given by:\n\nT = 2π / |Im(λ)|,\n\nwhere λ is an eigenvalue of A. In this case, |Im(λ)| = 2, so the period of each integral curve is:\n\nT = 2π / 2 = π."
