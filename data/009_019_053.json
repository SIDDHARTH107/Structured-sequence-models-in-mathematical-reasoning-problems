    "message_2": "To find the probability that the particle is in a negative position at time $t=2$, we can use the properties of Brownian motion. Brownian motion is a continuous-time stochastic process with the following properties:\n\n1. $x(0) = 0$\n2. The increments are stationary and independent.\n3. The increments are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance proportional to the time increment, i.e., $x(t) - x(s) \\sim N(0, D(t-s))$ for $t > s$.\n\nSince we are given the diffusion coefficient $D=1$, the variance of the position at time $t=2$ is $2D = 2$. Therefore, the position of the particle at time $t=2$ follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 2, i.e., $x(2) \\sim N(0, 2)$.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $x(2)$ is negative, i.e., $P(x(2) < 0)$. To do this, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution. The CDF of a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ is given by:\n\n$$F(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + \\text{erf} \\left( \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\right]$$\n\nwhere $\\text{erf}(x)$ is the error function. In our case, $\\mu = 0$ and $\\sigma^2 = 2$, so $\\sigma = \\sqrt{2}$. We want to find $F(0)$:\n\n$$F(0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + \\text{erf} \\left( \\frac{0 - 0}{\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + \\text{erf}(0) \\right]$$\n\nSince $\\text{erf}(0) = 0$, we have:\n\n$$F(0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + 0 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThus, the probability that the particle is in a negative position at time $t=2$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
