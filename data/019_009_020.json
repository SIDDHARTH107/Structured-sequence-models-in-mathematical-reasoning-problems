    "message_1": "Consider the intuitionistic logic proposition p → (q → r), where p, q, and r are either true or false. If we know that p → q is false and q → r is true, what can we say about the truth value of p → (¬r)?",
    "message_2": "In intuitionistic logic, the implication A → B is true if there is a proof of B from A. If p → q is false, it means there is no proof of q from p. Since q → r is true, there is a proof of r from q.\n\nNow, let's consider p → (¬r). If there is a proof of ¬r from p, then p → (¬r) would be true. However, we know that there is no proof of q from p, and there is a proof of r from q. This means that we cannot directly infer the truth value of p → (¬r) based on the given information.\n\nIn intuitionistic logic, we cannot always determine the truth value of a proposition without more information about the proofs involved. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether p → (¬r) is true or false based on the given information."
