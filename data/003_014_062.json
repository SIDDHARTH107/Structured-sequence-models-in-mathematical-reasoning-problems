    "message_2": "The given function is y = 6sin(2x + pi/6).\n\n1. Amplitude: The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function. In this case, the amplitude is |6| = 6.\n\n2. Period: The period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π) / |B|, where B is the coefficient of the variable x inside the sine function. In this case, B = 2. So, the period is (2π) / |2| = π.\n\n3. Phase Shift: The phase shift is given by the formula -C / B, where C is the constant added to the variable x inside the sine function. In this case, C = pi/6. So, the phase shift is -(pi/6) / 2 = -pi/12.\n\nSo, the amplitude is 6, the period is π, and the phase shift is -π/12."
