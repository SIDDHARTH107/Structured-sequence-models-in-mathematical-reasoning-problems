    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 2^40 is divided by 5, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. We know that 2^4 = 16, and 16 ≡ 1 (mod 5) because 16 divided by 5 has a remainder of 1. \n\nNow, we can rewrite 2^40 as (2^4)^10. Since 2^4 ≡ 1 (mod 5), we have:\n\n(2^4)^10 ≡ 1^10 (mod 5)\n\n1^10 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nSo, the remainder when 2^40 is divided by 5 is 1."
