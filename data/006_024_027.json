    "message_1": "A couple is planning to take a road trip from their home to a beach resort. The total distance of the trip is 500 km. Based on their past experience, they estimate the probability of encountering traffic congestion or road construction is 0.2. If they do encounter traffic or road construction, the trip will take 2 hours longer than the estimated 6-hour travel time. What is the probability that their travel time will be more than 8 hours?",
    "message_2": "The probability of encountering traffic congestion or road construction is 0.2. If they do encounter these issues, their travel time will be 6 hours (estimated travel time) + 2 hours (additional time due to traffic or construction) = 8 hours.\n\nSince the question asks for the probability that their travel time will be more than 8 hours, we can conclude that the probability of this happening is equal to the probability of encountering traffic congestion or road construction, which is 0.2."
