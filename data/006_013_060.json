    "message_2": "To find the probability of both events occurring in the same year, we can multiply the probabilities of each event occurring independently.\n\nThe probability of a flood occurring in a given year is 1/10, since it happens once every 10 years.\n\nThe probability of an earthquake occurring in a given year is 1/15, since it happens once every 15 years.\n\nThe probability of both events occurring in the same year is:\n\n(1/10) * (1/15) = 1/150\n\nSo, the probability that the city will experience both a flood and an earthquake in a given year is 1/150 or approximately 0.0067 (rounded to four decimal places)."
