    "message_2": "The Lévy C curve is a self-replicating fractal. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of √2. So, after 5 iterations, the total length of the Lévy C curve can be calculated as follows:\n\nOriginal length × (√2)^number of iterations\n= 2 × (√2)^5\n= 2 × (2^(5/2))\n= 2 × 2^(2.5)\n= 2 × (2^2) × (2^0.5)\n= 2 × 4 × √2\n= 8 × √2 ≈ 11.3137 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Lévy C curve after 5 iterations is approximately 11.3137 units."
