    "message_1": "A student is standing 25 meters away from a tall building. The angle of elevation from the student's eye to the top of the building is 60 degrees. Find the height of the building (rounded to the nearest meter).",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nLet h be the height of the building and d be the distance from the student to the building (25 meters). We have:\n\ntan(60°) = h / d\n\nWe know that tan(60°) = √3 and d = 25 meters. So, we can write the equation as:\n\n√3 = h / 25\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 25 * √3\n\nh ≈ 25 * 1.732\n\nh ≈ 43.3\n\nRounded to the nearest meter, the height of the building is approximately 43 meters."
