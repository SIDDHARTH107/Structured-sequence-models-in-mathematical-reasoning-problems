    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 125, which is a prime power (125 = 5^3), we can apply the Sylow Theorems to analyze the structure of G.\n\nLet n_5 denote the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that n_5 divides the order of G and n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25.\n\nCase 1: n_5 = 1\nIf there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be this normal Sylow 5-subgroup. Since the order of P is 5^2 = 25, P is a group of order 25. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, P is either isomorphic to Z_25 or Z_5 x Z_5. \n\nNow, let Q be a subgroup of G with order 5 (which exists by Cauchy's Theorem). Since P is normal in G, the product PQ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 125. Thus, PQ = G.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to Z_25, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a cyclic group of order 25, which means G is cyclic.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to Z_5 x Z_5, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25 (which is Z_5 x Z_5).\n\nCase 2: n_5 = 25\nIf there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups, then G must have 25 * 5 = 125 elements of order 5. However, this is a contradiction since G has only 125 elements in total, and at least one element (the identity) does not have order 5.\n\nThus, the only possible structure for G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25."
