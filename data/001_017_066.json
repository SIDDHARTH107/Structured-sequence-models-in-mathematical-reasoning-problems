    "message_2": "To solve the logarithmic equation log₃(x) + log₃(2x + 5) = 4, we can use the properties of logarithms.\n\nFirst, we can use the product rule, which states that logₐ(x) + logₐ(y) = logₐ(xy). Applying this rule to our equation, we get:\n\nlog₃(x(2x + 5)) = 4\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\n3^4 = x(2x + 5)\n\n81 = 2x² + 5x\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. To solve it, let's first set it to equal zero:\n\n2x² + 5x - 81 = 0\n\nNow, we can try to factor the equation or use the quadratic formula. In this case, the equation doesn't factor easily, so let's use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 2, b = 5, and c = -81. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-5 ± √(5² - 4(2)(-81))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 648)) / 4\n\nx = (-5 ± √673) / 4\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (-5 + √673) / 4 ≈ 4.78\nx = (-5 - √673) / 4 ≈ -8.78\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with logarithms, we cannot have a negative value inside the logarithm. Therefore, the only valid solution is:\n\nx ≈ 4.78"
