    "message_2": "To solve the homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[ 2  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 1 -1  1 | 0 ]\n[ 4  2 -2 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNext, we perform row operations to get the matrix into row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  1 | 0 ]\n[ 2  1 -1 | 0 ]\n[ 4  2 -2 | 0 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with Row 2 - 2 * Row 1:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  3 -3 | 0 ]\n[ 4  2 -2 | 0 ]\n```\n\n3. Replace Row 3 with Row 3 - 4 * Row 1:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  3 -3 | 0 ]\n[ 0  6 -6 | 0 ]\n```\n\n4. Replace Row 3 with Row 3 - 2 * Row 2:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  1 | 0 ]\n[ 0  3 -3 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0  0 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we can write the system of linear equations from the row-echelon form:\n\n```\nx - y + z = 0\n3y - 3z = 0\n```\n\nSimplify the second equation:\n\n```\ny - z = 0\n```\n\nNow, we can express y in terms of z:\n\n```\ny = z\n```\n\nSubstitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n```\nx - z + z = 0\n```\n\nSimplify:\n\n```\nx = 0\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = 0\ny = z\nz = z\n```\n\nIn vector form, the solution is:\n\n```\n(0, z, z) = z(0, 1, 1)\n```\n\nThe solution set is a one-dimensional subspace of R^3, which is a line passing through the origin with direction vector (0, 1, 1)."
