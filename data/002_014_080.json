    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The two opposite faces with dimensions 6 cm by 4 cm (base and top faces):\nArea = length × width = 6 cm × 4 cm = 24 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is 24 cm² × 2 = 48 cm².\n\n2. The two opposite faces with dimensions 6 cm by 8 cm (front and back faces):\nArea = length × height = 6 cm × 8 cm = 48 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is 48 cm² × 2 = 96 cm².\n\n3. The two opposite faces with dimensions 4 cm by 8 cm (left and right faces):\nArea = width × height = 4 cm × 8 cm = 32 cm²\nSince there are two of these faces, their combined area is 32 cm² × 2 = 64 cm².\n\nNow, we add the areas of all the faces together:\nTotal surface area = 48 cm² + 96 cm² + 64 cm² = 208 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 208 cm²."
