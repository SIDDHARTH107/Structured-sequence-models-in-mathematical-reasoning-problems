    "message_1": "A teacher wants to assign a project to a group of 7 students. Each student must work on exactly two projects with another student. How many pairs of students are possible?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of possible pairs of students, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of students and k is the size of the group (in this case, 2).\n\nSo, we have C(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!)\n\n= 7! / (2! * 5!)\n\n= (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n\n= (7 * 6) / (2 * 1)\n\n= 21\n\nTherefore, there are 21 possible pairs of students for the teacher to assign projects to."
