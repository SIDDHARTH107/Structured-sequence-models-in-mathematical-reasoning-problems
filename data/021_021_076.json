    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products A and B with a profit contribution per unit of $3 and $4, respectively. The company has two machines that can be used to produce both products. Each machine can process the products in different durations as shown in the table below:\n\n| Machines | Processing time for A (minutes) | Processing time for B (minutes) |\n| -------- | --------------- | ----------------- |\n| Machine 1 | 8               | 10                |\n| Machine 2 | 5               | 7                 |\n\nThe machines can operate for a maximum of 400 minutes per day. The company's daily demand for product A is 80 units, and for B is 60 units. Use the Cuckoo Search Algorithm to determine the daily production schedule that maximizes the company's total profit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Cuckoo Search Algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialization: Define the initial population of \"nests\" (solutions) randomly. In this case, each nest represents a production schedule, with the number of units of product A and B produced by each machine.\n\n2. Fitness function: Define a function to evaluate the quality of each solution. In this case, the fitness function should calculate the total profit based on the production schedule, considering the profit per unit and the processing time constraints.\n\n3. Cuckoo update: For each nest, generate a new solution by modifying the current one using a Levy flight (a random walk with a specific probability distribution). If the new solution is better (higher profit) and satisfies the constraints (processing time and demand), replace the current solution with the new one.\n\n4. Abandonment: If a nest has not improved after a certain number of iterations, abandon it and replace it with a new random solution.\n\n5. Selection: Keep the best solutions (highest profit) and discard the worst ones.\n\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory profit level).\n\nApplying the Cuckoo Search Algorithm to this problem, we can find an optimal production schedule that maximizes the company's total profit while satisfying the processing time and demand constraints. Note that the actual implementation of the algorithm requires programming skills and the use of optimization libraries or frameworks."
