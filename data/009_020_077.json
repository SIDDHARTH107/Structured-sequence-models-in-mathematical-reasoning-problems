We want to design an optimal control strategy, minimizing the cost function J = ∫[x(t)^2 + u(t)^2]dt, subject to the initial and final conditions x(0) = 0, x(1) = 2 and x'(0) = 0, x'(1) = 0.\n\nFind the control signal u(t) that minimizes the cost J, and the corresponding trajectory x(t) of the system.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimal control problem, we will use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. First, let's rewrite the given differential equation as a first-order system:\n\nLet x1 = x and x2 = x'. Then, we have:\n\nx1' = x2\nx2' = u(t) - 2x2 - x1\n\nNow, we define the Hamiltonian H as follows:\n\nH = x1^2 + u^2 + λ1x2 + λ2(u - 2x2 - x1)\n\nwhere λ1 and λ2 are the costate variables. According to Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, the optimal control u(t) minimizes the Hamiltonian. To find the optimal control, we take the partial derivative of H with respect to u and set it to zero:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u + λ2 = 0\n\nSolving for u, we get:\n\nu(t) = -1/2 * λ2(t)\n\nNow, we need to find the costate equations. The costate equations are given by the negative partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian with respect to the state variables:\n\nλ1' = -∂H/∂x1 = -2x1 + λ2\nλ2' = -∂H/∂x2 = -λ1 - 4x2 + 2λ2\n\nWe have a Two-Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP) with the following boundary conditions:\n\nx1(0) = 0, x2(0) = 0, x1(1) = 2, x2(1) = 0\n\nTo solve this TPBVP, we can use the shooting method. We guess the initial values of λ1(0) and λ2(0) and integrate the state and costate equations forward in time. We then adjust the initial values of λ1(0) and λ2(0) until the final conditions x1(1) = 2 and x2(1) = 0 are satisfied.\n\nOnce we find the optimal costates λ1(t) and λ2(t), we can plug them back into the optimal control equation:\n\nu(t) = -1/2 * λ2(t)\n\nFinally, we can integrate the state equations with the optimal control to find the optimal trajectory x(t)."
