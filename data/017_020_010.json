    "message_2": "There are five non-isomorphic groups of order 40. They are:\n\n1. Cyclic group C40: This group has a single generator and is of the form ⟨a⟩, where a has order 40. The group structure is Z40.\n\n2. Dihedral group D20: This group consists of symmetries of a regular 20-gon, including rotations and reflections. It has two generators, r and s, with orders 20 and 2, respectively. The group structure is D20, and the presentation is ⟨r, s | r^20 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(-1)⟩.\n\n3. Direct product of C8 and C5, denoted as C8 × C5: This group is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 5. The group structure is Z8 × Z5.\n\n4. Direct product of C4 and C10, denoted as C4 × C10: This group is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 10. The group structure is Z4 × Z10.\n\n5. Semidirect product of C5 acting on C8, denoted as C5 ⋊ C8: This is a non-abelian group, where C5 acts on C8 by automorphisms. One possible presentation is ⟨a, b | a^5 = b^8 = 1, a^(-1)ba = b^3⟩.\n\nSo, there are five non-isomorphic groups of order 40: C40, D20, C8 × C5, C4 × C10, and C5 ⋊ C8."
