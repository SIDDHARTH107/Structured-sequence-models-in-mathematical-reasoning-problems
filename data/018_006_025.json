    "message_1": "Let U be a universal set such that U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Let set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} be a subset of U. What is the complement of set A, and what is the union of set A and its complement? Show that the union of set A and its complement is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of set A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. The complement of set A, denoted as A', can be found by subtracting the elements of set A from the universal set U:\n\nA' = U - A = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, to find the union of set A and its complement A', we need to combine all the elements from both sets without repetition:\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ∪ {6, 7, 8, 9, 10} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nAs we can see, the union of set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nThis demonstrates that the union of set A and its complement is indeed equal to the universal set U."
