    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of successful outcomes (rolling a number greater than 4) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any number from 1 to 6).\n\nThere are two successful outcomes: rolling a 5 or a 6. There are six possible outcomes in total: rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\nSo, the probability of winning the game is:\n\n(number of successful outcomes) / (total number of possible outcomes) = 2 / 6\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\n2 / 6 = 1 / 3\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning the game is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333 (rounded to four decimal places)."
