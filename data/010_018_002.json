    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic of a Morse-Smale complex can be computed using the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index. In this case, we have:\n\nχ = (# of index-0) - (# of index-1) + (# of index-2) - (# of index-3)\n\nPlugging in the given numbers of critical points, we get:\n\nχ = (2) - (1) + (2) - (2)\n\nχ = 1\n\nSo the Euler characteristic of the Morse-Smale complex is 1."
