    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question about vibrations and oscillations in a mechanical system for a math student to solve:\n\nA mass-spring system with a mass of 2 kg and a spring constant of 80 N/m is initially displaced 3 cm from its equilibrium position and released from rest. Find the displacement function of the mass and the frequency of oscillation.",
    "message_2": "To find the displacement function and the frequency of oscillation for the given mass-spring system, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Angular frequency (ω): ω = √(k/m)\n2. Frequency of oscillation (f): f = ω / (2π)\n3. Displacement function (x(t)): x(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere:\nk = spring constant (80 N/m)\nm = mass (2 kg)\nA = initial displacement (0.03 m, since it's given in cm)\nφ = phase angle (0, since the mass is released from rest)\n\nFirst, let's find the angular frequency (ω):\n\nω = √(k/m) = √(80/2) = √40\n\nNow, let's find the frequency of oscillation (f):\n\nf = ω / (2π) = √40 / (2π)\n\nFinally, let's find the displacement function (x(t)):\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ) = 0.03 * cos(√40 * t)\n\nSo, the displacement function of the mass is x(t) = 0.03 * cos(√40 * t), and the frequency of oscillation is f = √40 / (2π)."
