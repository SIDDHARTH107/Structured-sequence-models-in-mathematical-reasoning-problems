    "message_2": "To calculate the surface area of a cube, we use the formula:\n\nSurface area = 6 × (side length)^2\n\nIn this case, the side length is 4 cm. So, we plug in the values:\n\nSurface area = 6 × (4 cm)^2\nSurface area = 6 × 16 cm^2\nSurface area = 96 cm^2\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 96 square centimeters."
