    "message_2": "Proof:\n\n(1) Suppose $\\alpha$ is exact. Then, there exists a $(k-1)$-form $\\beta$ such that $\\alpha = d\\beta$. Let $c$ be any smooth $(n-k-1)$-chain in $M$. Then, by Stokes' theorem, we have\n\n$$\\int_c \\alpha = \\int_c d\\beta = \\int_{\\partial c} \\beta.$$\n\nSince $c$ is a chain, its boundary $\\partial c$ is a $(n-k-2)$-cycle, which is a closed $(n-k-2)$-chain. However, since $k<n$, we have $n-k-2 \\geq 0$. Thus, $\\partial c$ is an empty set, and the integral becomes\n\n$$\\int_{\\partial c} \\beta = 0.$$\n\nSo, for any smooth $(n-k-1)$-chain $c$ in $M$, we have $\\int_c \\alpha = 0$.\n\n(2) Conversely, suppose that for any smooth $(n-k-1)$-chain $c$ in $M$, we have $\\int_c \\alpha = 0$. We want to show that $\\alpha$ is exact. By Poincaré lemma, it suffices to show that $\\alpha$ is locally exact, i.e., exact in a neighborhood of each point in $M$. \n\nLet $p$ be an arbitrary point in $M$. Choose a coordinate chart $(U, \\phi)$ around $p$. In this chart, we can write $\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^n f_i dx^i$ for some smooth functions $f_i$. Let $c$ be a smooth $(n-k-1)$-chain in $U$ with boundary $\\partial c$. Then, by our assumption, we have\n\n$$\\int_c \\alpha = \\int_c \\sum_{i=1}^n f_i dx^i = 0.$$\n\nBy Stokes' theorem, we have\n\n$$\\int_{\\partial c} \\sum_{i=1}^n f_i dx^i = 0.$$\n\nSince this holds for any smooth $(n-k-1)$-chain $c$ in $U$, it follows that $\\alpha$ is exact in $U$. Thus, $\\alpha$ is locally exact, and by Poincaré lemma, $\\alpha$ is exact.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $M$ is a closed oriented 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold and $\\alpha$ is a closed 1-form on $M$. Given that $\\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha = 2\\pi$ for some closed curve $\\gamma$, we want to show that $\\alpha$ is not exact.\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that $\\alpha$ is exact. Then, there exists a 0-form (i.e., a function) $f$ such that $\\alpha = df$. Since $\\gamma$ is a closed curve, we have\n\n$$\\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha = \\int_{\\gamma} df = f(\\gamma(1)) - f(\\gamma(0)).$$\n\nHowever, since $\\gamma$ is a closed curve, we have $\\gamma(1) = \\gamma(0)$, and thus\n\n$$\\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha = f(\\gamma(1)) - f(\\gamma(0)) = 0.$$\n\nThis contradicts the given condition that $\\int_{\\gamma} \\alpha = 2\\pi$. Therefore, $\\alpha$ cannot be exact."
