    "message_1": "A company has 5 machines and needs to allocate its resources effectively to maximize production. Each machine has a daily production capacity of 20 units. However, to keep the machines running smoothly, each machine needs to undergo maintenance at least once every 3 days. The company has a total of 20 workdays to allocate to these machines.\n\nHow should the company allocate its workdays to each machine to maximize production while still ensuring that each machine gets its necessary maintenance?",
    "message_2": "To maximize production, the company should aim to have as many machines running as possible while still ensuring that each machine gets its necessary maintenance. Since each machine needs maintenance at least once every 3 days, we can divide the 20 workdays into 3-day cycles, with a remainder of 2 days.\n\nThere are 6 full 3-day cycles (18 days) and 1 partial 2-day cycle (2 days) in the 20 workdays. In each 3-day cycle, the company can allocate 2 days for production and 1 day for maintenance for each machine. This way, each machine will undergo maintenance at least once every 3 days.\n\nFor the 6 full 3-day cycles, each machine will have 12 days of production (2 days per cycle * 6 cycles) and 6 days of maintenance (1 day per cycle * 6 cycles). In the partial 2-day cycle, the company can allocate 1 day for production and 1 day for maintenance for each machine.\n\nSo, the final allocation of workdays for each machine is as follows:\n\n- 12 days of production in the full 3-day cycles\n- 1 day of production in the partial 2-day cycle\n- Total: 13 days of production and 7 days of maintenance for each machine\n\nWith this allocation, each machine will produce 20 units per day for 13 days, resulting in a total production of 260 units per machine. Since there are 5 machines, the company will have a maximum production of 1300 units (260 units per machine * 5 machines) while still ensuring that each machine gets its necessary maintenance."
