    "message_2": "To find the measure of each angle in the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines first, and then use the Law of Sines.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the triangle as a = 6, b = 7, and c = 9. Let A, B, and C be the angles opposite to sides a, b, and c, respectively.\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find one of the angles. Let's find angle A:\n\ncos(A) = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2) / (2bc)\ncos(A) = (7^2 + 9^2 - 6^2) / (2 * 7 * 9)\ncos(A) = (49 + 81 - 36) / (126)\ncos(A) = 94 / 126\ncos(A) ≈ 0.746\n\nNow, we can find the measure of angle A by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nA = arccos(0.746)\nA ≈ 41.81°\n\nNow that we have angle A, we can use the Law of Sines to find angles B and C:\n\nsin(B) / b = sin(A) / a\nsin(B) / 7 = sin(41.81°) / 6\n\nsin(B) ≈ (7 * sin(41.81°)) / 6\nsin(B) ≈ 0.806\n\nNow, we can find the measure of angle B by taking the inverse sine (arcsin) of the result:\n\nB = arcsin(0.806)\nB ≈ 53.47°\n\nFinally, we can find angle C by subtracting the sum of angles A and B from 180° (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°):\n\nC = 180° - (41.81° + 53.47°)\nC ≈ 180° - 95.28°\nC ≈ 84.72°\n\nSo, the measures of the angles in the triangle are approximately A = 41.81°, B = 53.47°, and C = 84.72°."
