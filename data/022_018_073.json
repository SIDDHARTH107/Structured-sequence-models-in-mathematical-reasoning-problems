    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using complex analysis, we first rewrite the PDE in terms of the complex variable $z = x + iy$. The given PDE can be written as:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z \\partial \\bar{z}} = 0$\n\nwhere $\\bar{z} = x - iy$ is the complex conjugate of $z$. This PDE is the Cauchy-Riemann equation for the function $u(z, \\bar{z})$. Since the PDE is satisfied by analytic functions, we can write $u(z, \\bar{z})$ as the sum of an analytic function $f(z)$ and its complex conjugate $\\bar{f}(\\bar{z})$:\n\n$u(z, \\bar{z}) = f(z) + \\bar{f}(\\bar{z})$\n\nNow, we apply the given boundary conditions to determine the functions $f(z)$ and $\\bar{f}(\\bar{z})$. \n\n1. $u(0, y) = e^{-y}$:\n\nWhen $x = 0$, we have $z = iy$ and $\\bar{z} = -iy$. Thus,\n\n$u(z, \\bar{z}) = f(iy) + \\bar{f}(-iy) = e^{-y}$\n\n2. $u(x, 0) = e^{-x}$:\n\nWhen $y = 0$, we have $z = x$ and $\\bar{z} = x$. Thus,\n\n$u(z, \\bar{z}) = f(x) + \\bar{f}(x) = e^{-x}$\n\nNow, we can find $f(z)$ and $\\bar{f}(\\bar{z})$ by solving the above two equations simultaneously. We can write:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}(u(z, \\bar{z}) - \\bar{f}(\\bar{z}))$\n\nSubstituting the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$f(iy) = \\frac{1}{2}(e^{-y} - \\bar{f}(-iy))$ and $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(e^{-x} - \\bar{f}(x))$\n\nSince $f(z)$ is an analytic function, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$f'(z) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -i \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$\n\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $z$, we obtain:\n\n$f(z) = -i \\int f'(z) dz + C$\n\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Now, we can use the boundary conditions to find $f(z)$ and $\\bar{f}(\\bar{z})$. We have:\n\n$f(iy) = -i \\int_{0}^{y} f'(iy) dy + C_1$ and $f(x) = -i \\int_{0}^{x} f'(x) dx + C_2$\n\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration. Comparing these expressions with the boundary conditions, we can find the values of $C_1$ and $C_2$. We obtain:\n\n$C_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + e^{-y})$ and $C_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + e^{-x})$\n\nThus, the function $u(z, \\bar{z})$ can be written as:\n\n$u(z, \\bar{z}) = f(z) + \\bar{f}(\\bar{z}) = -i \\int_{0}^{z} f'(z) dz + \\frac{1}{2}(1 + e^{-z}) + \\bar{-i \\int_{0}^{\\bar{z}} f'(\\bar{z}) d\\bar{z} + \\frac{1}{2}(1 + e^{-\\bar{z}})}$\n\nThis is the solution to the given PDE with the specified boundary conditions."
