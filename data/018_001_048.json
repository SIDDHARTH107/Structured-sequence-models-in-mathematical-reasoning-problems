    "message_2": "Let A be a set with 10 elements, i.e., |A| = 10. Let ∅ denote the empty set, which has no elements.\n\nTo prove that the empty set is a subset of set A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of set A. In set notation, this can be written as:\n\n∀x (x ∈ ∅ → x ∈ A)\n\nSince the empty set has no elements, there are no elements x that belong to the empty set. Therefore, the statement \"x ∈ ∅ → x ∈ A\" is vacuously true for all x.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the empty set ∅ is a subset of set A:\n\n∅ ⊆ A"
