Player B also has a choice to either play strategy X, which yields a payoff of $6, or strategy Y, which yields a payoff of $2.\n\nIf the players make their decisions simultaneously and independently, what is the optimal strategy for each player? What is the resulting payoff for each player under this optimal strategy combination?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for each player, we can create a payoff matrix to compare the possible outcomes:\n\n```\n          Player B\n          X    Y\n        _________\nPlayer A|\nX      | 5,6  5,2\n        |\nY      | 3,6  3,2\n```\n\nIn this matrix, the first number in each cell represents the payoff for Player A, and the second number represents the payoff for Player B.\n\nPlayer A will choose strategy X if they believe Player B will choose strategy X or Y, as the payoff for A is higher with X ($5) than with Y ($3). Similarly, Player B will choose strategy X if they believe Player A will choose strategy X or Y, as the payoff for B is higher with X ($6) than with Y ($2).\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy for both players is to choose strategy X. The resulting payoff for each player under this optimal strategy combination is $5 for Player A and $6 for Player B."
