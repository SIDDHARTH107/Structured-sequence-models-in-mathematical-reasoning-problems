    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve in regression analysis:\n\nSuppose an economist wants to predict the annual salary of individuals based on their level of education. The economist collects data on 50 individuals and finds that the correlation coefficient between education level and annual salary is 0.8. Using regression analysis, the economist obtains the following linear model: \n\nAnnual salary = 10,000 + 5,000 x education level\n\nIf an individual has completed 15 years of education, what is their predicted annual salary according to the model?",
    "message_2": "To find the predicted annual salary for an individual with 15 years of education, we can plug the education level into the linear model equation:\n\nAnnual salary = 10,000 + 5,000 x education level\n\nAnnual salary = 10,000 + 5,000 x 15\n\nAnnual salary = 10,000 + 75,000\n\nAnnual salary = 85,000\n\nAccording to the model, an individual with 15 years of education is predicted to have an annual salary of $85,000."
