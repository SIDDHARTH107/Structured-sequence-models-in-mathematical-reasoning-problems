    "message_1": "Consider the following system of 3 linear equations:\n\n-2x + 3y - z = 7\n4x - 2y + 2z = 9\n5x - y + 3z = 2\n\nNow, suppose that there is some noise in the measurement of the coefficients of the system so that we have an error in each coefficient of at most 0.1. Solve the system with these noisy coefficients and find the absolute error in the values of x, y, and z compared to the true values (assuming you know the true values of x, y, and z).",
    "message_2": "First, let's solve the given system of linear equations to find the true values of x, y, and z.\n\n-2x + 3y - z = 7\n4x - 2y + 2z = 9\n5x - y + 3z = 2\n\nWe can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve this system. First, we'll eliminate x from the second and third equations:\n\n1) Multiply the first equation by 2 and add it to the second equation:\n(2 * -2x) + 4x = 0\n(2 * 3y) - 2y = 4y\n(2 * -z) + 2z = 0\n(2 * 7) + 9 = 23\n\nSo, the new second equation is:\n4y = 23\n\n2) Multiply the first equation by -5 and add it to the third equation:\n(-5 * -2x) + 5x = 5x\n(-5 * 3y) - y = -16y\n(-5 * -z) + 3z = 2z\n(-5 * 7) + 2 = -33\n\nSo, the new third equation is:\n-16y + 2z = -33\n\nNow, we'll eliminate y from the third equation:\n\n3) Divide the second equation by 4:\ny = 23/4\n\n4) Multiply the new second equation by 16 and add it to the third equation:\n(-16 * y) + 16y = 0\n(16 * 23/4) + 2z = 92\n-33 + 92 = 59\n\nSo, the new third equation is:\n2z = 59\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = 59/2\n\nSubstitute z into the second equation:\ny = 23/4\n\nSubstitute y and z into the first equation:\n-2x + 3(23/4) - (59/2) = 7\n-2x + 69/4 - 118/4 = 7\n-2x - 49/4 = 7\n-2x = 77/4\nx = -77/8\n\nSo, the true values are:\nx = -77/8\ny = 23/4\nz = 59/2\n\nNow, let's consider the noisy coefficients. The maximum error in each coefficient is 0.1. We'll create a system of equations with the maximum possible error for each coefficient:\n\n(-2 + 0.1)x + (3 + 0.1)y - (1 + 0.1)z = 7 + 0.1\n(4 + 0.1)x - (2 + 0.1)y + (2 + 0.1)z = 9 + 0.1\n(5 + 0.1)x - (1 + 0.1)y + (3 + 0.1)z = 2 + 0.1\n\nThe new system of equations is:\n\n-1.9x + 3.1y - 1.1z = 7.1\n4.1x - 2.1y + 2.1z = 9.1\n5.1x - 1.1y + 3.1z = 2.1\n\nSolving this system of equations using the same method as before:\n\n1) Multiply the first equation by 2.1 and add it to the second equation:\n(2.1 * -1.9x) + 4.1x = 0\n(2.1 * 3.1y) - 2.1y = 4.2y\n(2.1 * -1.1z) + 2.1z = 0\n(2.1 * 7.1) + 9.1 = 23.91\n\nSo, the new second equation is:\n4.2y = 23.91\n\n2) Multiply the first equation by -5.1 and add it to the third equation:\n(-5.1 * -1.9x) + 5.1x = 5.1x\n(-5.1 * 3.1y) - 1.1y = -16.61y\n(-5.1 * -1.1z) + 3.1z = 2.1z\n(-5.1 * 7.1) + 2.1 = -34.01\n\nSo, the new third equation is:\n-16.61y + 2.1z = -34.01\n\nNow, we'll eliminate y from the third equation:\n\n3) Divide the second equation by 4.2:\ny = 23.91/4.2\n\n4) Multiply the new second equation by 16.61 and add it to the third equation:\n(-16.61 * y) + 16.61y = 0\n(16.61 * 23.91/4.2) + 2.1z = 98.91\n-34.01 + 98.91 = 64.9\n\nSo, the new third equation is:\n2.1z = 64.9\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z:\n\nz = 64.9/2.1\n\nSubstitute z into the second equation:\ny = 23.91/4.2\n\nSubstitute y and z into the first equation:\n-1.9x + 3.1(23.91/4.2) - 1.1(64.9/2.1) = 7.1\n-1.9x + 69.01/4 - 71.9/2 = 7.1\n-1.9x - 49.9/4 = 7.1\n-1.9x = 77.9/4\nx = -77.9/7.6\n\nSo, the noisy values are:\nx = -77.9/7.6\ny = 23.91/4.2\nz = 64.9/2.1\n\nNow, let's find the absolute error in the values of x, y, and z:\n\nΔx = |-77/8 - (-77.9/7.6)|\nΔy = |23/4 - 23.91/4.2|\nΔz = |59/2 - 64.9/2.1|\n\nΔx ≈ 0.1026\nΔy ≈ 0.0971\nΔz ≈ 0.1048\n\nSo, the absolute errors in the values of x, y, and z are approximately 0.1026, 0.0971, and 0.1048, respectively."
