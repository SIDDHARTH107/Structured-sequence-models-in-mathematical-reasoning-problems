    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of y in both equations equal:\n\n(1) 6x + 4y - 2z = 10 + 6i\n(2) 6x - 3y + 12z = 6 - 6i\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate y:\n\n(1) - (2): 7y - 14z = 4 + 12i\n\nNow, let's divide this equation by 7:\n\ny - 2z = (4/7) + (12/7)i\n\nNow we have an equation for y in terms of z:\n\ny = 2z + (4/7) + (12/7)i\n\nNow, let's substitute this expression for y into the third equation:\n\n5x + 3(2z + (4/7) + (12/7)i) + 2z = 1 + 9i\n\n5x + 6z + (12/7) + (36/7)i + 2z = 1 + 9i\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n5x + 8z = (1 - 12/7) + (9 - 36/7)i\n\n5x + 8z = (-5/7) + (27/7)i\n\nNow, let's substitute the expression for y back into the first equation:\n\n3x + 2(2z + (4/7) + (12/7)i) - z = 5 + 3i\n\n3x + 4z + (8/7) + (24/7)i - z = 5 + 3i\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\n2x + 3z = (5 - 8/7) + (3 - 24/7)i\n\n2x + 3z = (27/7) - (9/7)i\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n(3) 5x + 8z = (-5/7) + (27/7)i\n(4) 2x + 3z = (27/7) - (9/7)i\n\nLet's multiply equation (4) by 2.5 and subtract equation (3) from it:\n\n5x + 7.5z = (67.5/7) - (22.5/7)i\n- (5x + 8z) = (-5/7) + (27/7)i\n-----------------------------------\n-0.5z = (62.5/7) - (49.5/7)i\n\nNow, let's divide by -0.5:\n\nz = (-125/7) + (99/7)i\n\nNow that we have z, we can substitute it back into the equation for y:\n\ny = 2((-125/7) + (99/7)i) + (4/7) + (12/7)i\n\ny = (-250/7) + (198/7)i + (4/7) + (12/7)i\n\ny = (-246/7) + (210/7)i\n\nNow, let's substitute z back into equation (4) to find x:\n\n2x + 3((-125/7) + (99/7)i) = (27/7) - (9/7)i\n\n2x - (375/7) + (297/7)i = (27/7) - (9/7)i\n\nNow, let's add (375/7) - (297/7)i to both sides:\n\n2x = (402/7) - (306/7)i\n\nNow, let's divide by 2:\n\nx = (201/7) - (153/7)i\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = (201/7) - (153/7)i\ny = (-246/7) + (210/7)i\nz = (-125/7) + (99/7)i"
