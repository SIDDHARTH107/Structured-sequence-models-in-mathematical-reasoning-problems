    "message_2": "To find the optimal control strategy that minimizes fuel consumption, we need to consider the rocket equation, which relates the change in velocity to the mass of the rocket and the mass of the expelled fuel:\n\nΔv = ve * ln(m_initial / m_final)\n\nwhere Δv is the change in velocity, ve is the effective exhaust velocity, m_initial is the initial mass of the rocket (including fuel), and m_final is the final mass of the rocket (excluding fuel).\n\nThe rocket needs to reach a velocity of 8000 m/s in 100 seconds. We can calculate the required acceleration (a) as follows:\n\na = Δv / t = 8000 m/s / 100 s = 80 m/s²\n\nNow, we can find the required force (F) to achieve this acceleration using Newton's second law:\n\nF = m * a = 5000 kg * 80 m/s² = 400,000 N\n\nSince the maximum thrust of the rocket's engine is 10,000 N, it is not possible to achieve the required acceleration with the given engine. However, we can still try to minimize fuel consumption by operating the engine at its maximum thrust for the entire 100 seconds.\n\nTo do this, we need to find the effective exhaust velocity (ve) of the rocket. We can use the rocket equation and the given values to find ve:\n\n8000 m/s = ve * ln(5000 kg / m_final)\n\nAssuming the engine operates at its maximum thrust (10,000 N) for the entire 100 seconds, we can find the total impulse (I) provided by the engine:\n\nI = F * t = 10,000 N * 100 s = 1,000,000 Ns\n\nNow, we can find the effective exhaust velocity (ve) using the total impulse and the mass of the expelled fuel (m_fuel):\n\nve = I / m_fuel\n\nWe can now substitute this expression for ve back into the rocket equation:\n\n8000 m/s = (1,000,000 Ns / m_fuel) * ln(5000 kg / (5000 kg - m_fuel))\n\nThis equation can be solved numerically to find the optimal fuel mass (m_fuel) that minimizes fuel consumption while still achieving the desired velocity. However, it is important to note that the given engine's maximum thrust is not sufficient to achieve the required acceleration, so the rocket will not reach the desired velocity within the specified time."
