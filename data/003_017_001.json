    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function on a given interval, we use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = sin(x), and the interval is [0, π/2]. So, a = 0 and b = π/2.\n\nAverage value = (1/(π/2 - 0)) * ∫[0, π/2] sin(x) dx\n\nAverage value = (2/π) * ∫[0, π/2] sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π/2:\n\n∫ sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n(-cos(π/2) + C) - (-cos(0) + C) = -cos(π/2) + cos(0) = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nSo, the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π/2 is 1.\n\nNow, we can find the average value:\n\nAverage value = (2/π) * 1 = 2/π\n\nTherefore, the average value of the function f(x) = sin(x) on the interval [0, π/2] is 2/π."
