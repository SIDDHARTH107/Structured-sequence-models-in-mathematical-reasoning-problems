    "message_2": "Edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph. In other words, it is the smallest number of edges that, if removed, would result in the graph becoming disconnected.\n\nA connected graph with n vertices and e edges has edge connectivity λ(G) ≤ e - n + 1.\n\nIn this case, the graph has 10 vertices (n = 10) and 14 edges (e = 14). Using the formula:\n\nλ(G) ≤ 14 - 10 + 1\nλ(G) ≤ 5\n\nSo, the edge connectivity of the given graph is at most 5. However, to determine the exact edge connectivity, we would need more information about the specific structure of the graph."
