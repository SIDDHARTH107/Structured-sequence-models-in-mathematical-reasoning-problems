Next, find the Cartesian product of the complements of A and B. Finally, determine whether the Cartesian product is distributive over complement or not.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) such that a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the Cartesian product. The complement of a set is the set of all elements that are not in the given set. However, the complement of a Cartesian product is not well-defined unless we know the universal set for both A and B. Let's assume the universal set for A is U_A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and for B is U_B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Then, the complement of A × B with respect to U_A × U_B is:\n\n(A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of A and B:\n\nA' = {4, 5}\nB' = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of the complements of A and B:\n\nA' × B' = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nFinally, let's determine whether the Cartesian product is distributive over complement or not. For the Cartesian product to be distributive over complement, the following equation must hold:\n\n(A × B)' = A' × B' + A × B'\n\nHowever, we can see that the sets (A × B)' and A' × B' + A × B' are not equal:\n\n(A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\nA' × B' + A × B' = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nSince (A × B)' ≠ A' × B' + A × B', the Cartesian product is not distributive over complement."
