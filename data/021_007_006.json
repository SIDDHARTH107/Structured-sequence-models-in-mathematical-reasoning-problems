    "message_2": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method to find the roots of a real-valued function. Given a function f(x) and an initial guess x0, the method generates a sequence of approximations to the root using the formula:\n\nx_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nwhere f'(x) is the derivative of f(x) with respect to x.\n\nFor the given function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6, we first need to find its derivative:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nNow, we will apply the Newton-Raphson method starting from the initial guess x0 = 1.5. We will iterate until the difference between consecutive approximations is less than 10^(-4).\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\nx1 = 1.5 - (1.5^3 - 6*1.5^2 + 11*1.5 - 6) / (3*1.5^2 - 12*1.5 + 11)\nx1 = 1.5 - (3.375 - 13.5 + 16.5 - 6) / (6.75 - 18 + 11)\nx1 = 1.5 - (0.375) / 0.25\nx1 = 1.5 - 1.5\nx1 = 1\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - f(x1) / f'(x1)\nx2 = 1 - (1^3 - 6*1^2 + 11*1 - 6) / (3*1^2 - 12*1 + 11)\nx2 = 1 - (1 - 6 + 11 - 6) / (3 - 12 + 11)\nx2 = 1 - 0 / 2\nx2 = 1\n\nSince x1 and x2 are the same, we have reached the desired accuracy, and the root is x = 1.0000."
