    "message_1": "Let M be a three-dimensional manifold, and let X and Y be vector fields on M such that X = 2x²∂/∂x + 3xyz∂/∂y - yz²∂/∂z and Y = x(1-x²)y∂/∂x + 2y²∂/∂y - z∂/∂z. Determine the Lie derivative of X with respect to Y.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of X with respect to Y, we use the Lie bracket [Y, X], which is defined as [Y, X] = YX - XY. The Lie bracket of two vector fields measures how much they fail to commute. \n\nFirst, let's compute YX:\n\nYX = x(1-x²)y(2x²∂/∂x) + 2y²(3xyz∂/∂y) - z(-yz²∂/∂z)\n\nNow, we apply the product rule:\n\nYX = x(1-x²)y(2x²∂/∂x) + 2y²(3xyz∂/∂y) + yz³∂/∂z\n\nNext, let's compute XY:\n\nXY = (2x²∂/∂x)(x(1-x²)y∂/∂x) + (3xyz∂/∂y)(2y²∂/∂y) - (yz²∂/∂z)(-z∂/∂z)\n\nAgain, apply the product rule:\n\nXY = 2x³(1-x²)y∂/∂x + 6x²y²z∂/∂y + yz³∂/∂z\n\nNow, we can compute the Lie bracket [Y, X] = YX - XY:\n\n[Y, X] = (x(1-x²)y(2x²∂/∂x) + 2y²(3xyz∂/∂y) + yz³∂/∂z) - (2x³(1-x²)y∂/∂x + 6x²y²z∂/∂y + yz³∂/∂z)\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n[Y, X] = (-2x³(1-x²)y∂/∂x + 2x²y²z∂/∂y)\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of X with respect to Y is:\n\nL_Y(X) = [Y, X] = -2x³(1-x²)y∂/∂x + 2x²y²z∂/∂y"
