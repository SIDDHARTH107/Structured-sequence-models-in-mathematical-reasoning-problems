    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, using two machines, X and Y. The production of one unit of A requires 2 hours on machine X and 1 hour on machine Y, while the production of one unit of B requires 1 hour on machine X and 3 hours on machine Y. The maximum time available on machine X is 40 hours per week, while on machine Y it is 60 hours per week. The profit per unit of A is $10 and of B is $15. \nFormulate and solve the multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the total profit from production of A and B.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first set up the linear programming model and then solve it to find the optimal production levels of products A and B that maximize the total profit.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nObjective function (total profit to be maximized):\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraints (machine hours available):\n2x + y ≤ 40 (Machine X)\nx + 3y ≤ 60 (Machine Y)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity)\n\nNow we will solve the linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. 2x + y ≤ 40\ny ≤ -2x + 40\n\n2. x + 3y ≤ 60\ny ≤ (-1/3)x + 20\n\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of the areas defined by these inequalities. Now we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of y = -2x + 40 and y = (-1/3)x + 20:\n-2x + 40 = (-1/3)x + 20\n(5/3)x = 20\nx = 12\ny = -2(12) + 40 = 16\nCorner point: (12, 16)\n\n2. Intersection of y = -2x + 40 and x-axis (y = 0):\ny = -2x + 40\n0 = -2x + 40\nx = 20\nCorner point: (20, 0)\n\n3. Intersection of y = (-1/3)x + 20 and y-axis (x = 0):\ny = (-1/3)(0) + 20\ny = 20\nCorner point: (0, 20)\n\n4. Intersection of x-axis (y = 0) and y-axis (x = 0):\nCorner point: (0, 0)\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. P(12, 16) = 10(12) + 15(16) = 120 + 240 = $360\n2. P(20, 0) = 10(20) + 15(0) = 200 + 0 = $200\n3. P(0, 20) = 10(0) + 15(20) = 0 + 300 = $300\n4. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = 0 + 0 = $0\n\nThe maximum total profit is $360, which occurs when 12 units of product A and 16 units of product B are produced."
