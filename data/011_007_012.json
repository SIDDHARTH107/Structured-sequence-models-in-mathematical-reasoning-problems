    "message_2": "This is a classic problem in combinatorics known as the derangement problem. A derangement is a permutation of a set of objects such that no object appears in its original position. In this case, we want to find the number of derangements of 10 people, which is denoted as D(10) or !10.\n\nThe formula to calculate the number of derangements is:\n\nD(n) = n! * (1/0! - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n * 1/n!)\n\nApplying this formula to our problem, we have:\n\nD(10) = 10! * (1/0! - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + 1/4! - 1/5! + 1/6! - 1/7! + 1/8! - 1/9! + 1/10!)\n\nD(10) = 3,628,800 * (1 - 1 + 1/2 - 1/6 + 1/24 - 1/120 + 1/720 - 1/5040 + 1/40320 - 1/362880 + 1/3628800)\n\nD(10) = 3,628,800 * (0 + 1/2 - 1/6 + 1/24 - 1/120 + 1/720 - 1/5040 + 1/40320 - 1/362880 + 1/3628800)\n\nD(10) ≈ 3,628,800 * (0.5 - 0.1666667 + 0.0416667 - 0.0083333 + 0.0013889 - 0.0001984 + 0.0000248 - 0.0000028 + 0.0000003)\n\nD(10) ≈ 3,628,800 * 0.3678794\n\nD(10) ≈ 1,334,961.6\n\nSince the number of derangements must be a whole number, we round it to the nearest whole number:\n\nD(10) ≈ 1,334,962\n\nSo, there are approximately 1,334,962 ways for the group of friends to assign each person a gift recipient such that no person gets themselves as their gift recipient."
