    "message_2": "To find the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, we have:\n\nsin(30) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nsin(30) = opposite side / 10 cm\n\nSince sin(30) = 1/2, we can write:\n\n1/2 = opposite side / 10 cm\n\nNow, we can solve for the opposite side:\n\nopposite side = 1/2 * 10 cm\nopposite side = 5 cm\n\nSo, the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle is 5 cm."
