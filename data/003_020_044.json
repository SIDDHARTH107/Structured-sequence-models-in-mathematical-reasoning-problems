What is the distance between the person's feet and the point on the ground? Use trigonometry to find the solution.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the distance between the person's feet and the point on the ground as x. We can use the tangent function to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angle of elevation to the person's feet, which is standing on a 10-foot pedestal. Let's denote this angle as θ. We can use the right triangle formed by the pedestal, the ground, and the line of sight to the person's feet.\n\ntan(θ) = (height of pedestal) / x\ntan(θ) = 10 / x\n\nNow, let's consider the right triangle formed by the ground, the line of sight to the top of the statue, and the line from the person's feet to the top of the statue (which is 50 feet tall).\n\nSince the angle of elevation to the top of the statue is 45 degrees, we have:\n\ntan(45) = (height of statue + height of pedestal) / x\ntan(45) = (50 + 10) / x\ntan(45) = 60 / x\n\nWe know that tan(45) = 1, so:\n\n1 = 60 / x\nx = 60\n\nTherefore, the distance between the person's feet and the point on the ground is 60 feet."
