    "message_2": "To show that G has either 1 or 4 elements of order 3, we will use the fact that the order of an element divides the order of the group. Since the order of G is 9, the possible orders of its elements are 1, 3, and 9. Let n_i be the number of elements of order i in G. We know that n_1 = 1 because there is always one identity element in a group.\n\nNow, consider the case where there is an element of order 9 in G. In this case, G would be a cyclic group generated by that element, and G would be isomorphic to C9. In this case, there are no elements of order 3, so n_3 = 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there are no elements of order 9 in G. In this case, all non-identity elements of G must have order 3. By the class equation, we have:\n\n9 = n_1 + n_3\n\nSince n_1 = 1, we have n_3 = 8. However, elements of order 3 come in pairs (if x has order 3, then x^2 also has order 3 and is distinct from x). Therefore, there must be an even number of elements of order 3, so there can be either 1 or 4 elements of order 3 in G.\n\nNow, we will use this fact to prove that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nIf G has an element of order 9, then G is isomorphic to C9, as we discussed earlier.\n\nIf G has no elements of order 9, then all non-identity elements have order 3. In this case, G must have 4 elements of order 3. Let a and b be two distinct elements of order 3 in G. Since G is a group of order 9, the subgroup generated by a and b, denoted by <a, b>, must also have order 9. Furthermore, since a and b both have order 3, their product ab must also have order 3 (otherwise, G would have an element of order 9, which contradicts our assumption). Therefore, G is generated by two elements of order 3, and their product also has order 3.\n\nThis structure is precisely the structure of the non-abelian group of order 9, which can be represented as the set of matrices:\n\n{[1, 0], [a, 1], [a^2, 1], [1, b], [a, b], [a^2, b], [1, b^2], [a, b^2], [a^2, b^2]}\n\nwith matrix multiplication as the group operation, where a and b are elements of order 3 and ab has order 3.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C9 or the non-abelian group of order 9, depending on whether it has an element of order 9 or not."
