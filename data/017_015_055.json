    "message_2": "To find the non-abelian groups of order 24, we first note that 24 = 2^3 * 3. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structures of groups of order 24.\n\nLet G be a group of order 24. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 8 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of n_2 and n_3:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 8 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 3. Both P_2 and P_3 are normal in G, so G is a direct product of P_2 and P_3. Since P_2 is a group of order 8, it can be either Z_8, Z_4 x Z_2, or D_4 (dihedral group of order 8). P_3 is a group of order 3, so it must be isomorphic to Z_3. Thus, we have three possibilities for G: Z_8 x Z_3, Z_4 x Z_2 x Z_3, and D_4 x Z_3. All of these groups are abelian, so they are not non-abelian groups.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: In this case, G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 8 and four 3-Sylow subgroups. Since P_2 is normal in G, G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. P_2 can be either Z_8, Z_4 x Z_2, or D_4. For each of these possibilities, we can consider the possible actions of P_3 on P_2. However, in all cases, we find that the resulting groups are isomorphic to the groups in case 1, so there are no new non-abelian groups in this case.\n\n3. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1: In this case, G has three 2-Sylow subgroups and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since P_3 is normal in G, G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. P_2 can be either Z_8, Z_4 x Z_2, or D_4. For each of these possibilities, we can consider the possible actions of P_3 on P_2. In this case, we find the following non-abelian groups:\n\n  a. P_2 = Z_8: G is isomorphic to the semidirect product Z_8 ⋊ Z_3, which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_12 of order 24.\n  b. P_2 = Z_4 x Z_2: G is isomorphic to the semidirect product (Z_4 x Z_2) ⋊ Z_3, which is isomorphic to the group Z_6 x S_3, where S_3 is the symmetric group on 3 elements.\n  c. P_2 = D_4: G is isomorphic to the semidirect product D_4 ⋊ Z_3, which is isomorphic to the group Q_8 x Z_3, where Q_8 is the quaternion group of order 8.\n\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4: In this case, G has three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups. There are no normal subgroups in this case, so G cannot be a direct or semidirect product of P_2 and P_3. However, G can be isomorphic to the symmetric group S_4, which is a non-abelian group of order 24.\n\nIn summary, there are four non-abelian groups of order 24 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. D_12: Dihedral group of order 24.\n2. Z_6 x S_3: Direct product of the cyclic group of order 6 and the symmetric group on 3 elements.\n3. Q_8 x Z_3: Direct product of the quaternion group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 3.\n4. S_4: Symmetric group on 4 elements."
