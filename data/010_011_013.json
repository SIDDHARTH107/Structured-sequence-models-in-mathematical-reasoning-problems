    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic (χ) of a closed and bounded two-dimensional manifold without boundary can be calculated using the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere g is the genus of the manifold.\n\nGiven that the Euler characteristic of the manifold is 2, we can solve for the genus:\n\n2 = 2 - 2g\n0 = -2g\ng = 0\n\nSo, the genus of the manifold is 0. This means that the manifold is topologically equivalent to a sphere."
