    "message_2": "To find the average position of the particle, we need to compute the expectation value of the position operator $\\hat{x}$. In the position representation, the expectation value of an operator is given by the integral of the wave function multiplied by the operator and the complex conjugate of the wave function, integrated over all space. For the position operator, this is:\n\n$\\langle x \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi^*(x) \\hat{x} \\psi(x) dx$\n\nSince the wave function $\\psi(x) = 2\\cos(3x) + 3\\sin(5x)$ is real, the complex conjugate is just the same function:\n\n$\\psi^*(x) = 2\\cos(3x) + 3\\sin(5x)$\n\nNow we can compute the expectation value of the position operator:\n\n$\\langle x \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (2\\cos(3x) + 3\\sin(5x)) x (2\\cos(3x) + 3\\sin(5x)) dx$\n\nHowever, this integral is not well-defined, as it diverges to infinity. This is because the wave function is not normalizable, meaning it does not represent a physical state of a particle. In order to find the average position of a particle, we need a wave function that is square-integrable, which means that the integral of the square of the wave function over all space is finite.\n\nIn the context of Fourier analysis, the wave function $\\psi(x) = 2\\cos(3x) + 3\\sin(5x)$ can be seen as a superposition of two different frequency components. However, these components are not localized in space, so the average position of the particle cannot be determined.\n\nIn summary, the average position of the particle cannot be found using Fourier analysis for this wave function, as it is not a normalizable wave function representing a physical state of a particle."
