    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of the graph, we can use the Brooks' theorem, which states that for any connected graph G, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ(G) (the maximum degree of the vertices), except for complete graphs and odd cycles, where the chromatic number is Δ(G) + 1.\n\nIn our case, the graph has 8 vertices with the degree sequence 3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4. The maximum degree Δ(G) is 4. Since we have 4 vertices with degree 4, the graph cannot be a complete graph (as a complete graph with 8 vertices would have all vertices with degree 7). Additionally, the graph cannot be an odd cycle, as it has 8 vertices, which is an even number.\n\nTherefore, by Brooks' theorem, the chromatic number of the graph is at most Δ(G) = 4. So, the chromatic number of the graph is 4."
