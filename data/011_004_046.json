    "message_2": "To form a committee of 4 students from a group of 6 engineering students and 3 business students, we can consider the following cases:\n\n1. All 4 students are engineering students.\n2. 3 engineering students and 1 business student.\n3. 2 engineering students and 2 business students.\n\nCase 1: All 4 students are engineering students.\nThere are 6 engineering students, and we need to choose 4. This can be done in 6C4 ways.\n\n6C4 = 6! / (4! * (6-4)!)\n= 6! / (4! * 2!)\n= (6 * 5) / (2 * 1)\n= 15 ways\n\nCase 2: 3 engineering students and 1 business student.\nThere are 6 engineering students, and we need to choose 3. This can be done in 6C3 ways.\nThere are 3 business students, and we need to choose 1. This can be done in 3C1 ways.\n\n6C3 = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!)\n= 6! / (3! * 3!)\n= (6 * 5 * 4) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 20 ways\n\n3C1 = 3! / (1! * (3-1)!)\n= 3! / (1! * 2!)\n= 3\n\nSo, there are 20 * 3 = 60 ways for this case.\n\nCase 3: 2 engineering students and 2 business students.\nThere are 6 engineering students, and we need to choose 2. This can be done in 6C2 ways.\nThere are 3 business students, and we need to choose 2. This can be done in 3C2 ways.\n\n6C2 = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!)\n= 6! / (2! * 4!)\n= (6 * 5) / (2 * 1)\n= 15 ways\n\n3C2 = 3! / (2! * (3-2)!)\n= 3! / (2! * 1!)\n= 3\n\nSo, there are 15 * 3 = 45 ways for this case.\n\nIn total, there are 15 (case 1) + 60 (case 2) + 45 (case 3) = 120 ways to form a committee of 4 students from a group of 6 engineering students and 3 business students."
