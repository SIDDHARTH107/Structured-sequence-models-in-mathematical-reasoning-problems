This is an alternating series, and the terms (1/n) * sin(nπ/2) satisfy the conditions of the Leibniz's alternating series test:\n\n1. The terms are decreasing in magnitude: |(1/n) * sin(nπ/2)| ≥ |(1/(n+1)) * sin((n+1)π/2)|\n2. The terms approach zero as n approaches infinity: lim (n→∞) (1/n) * sin(nπ/2) = 0\n\nSince the conditions of the Leibniz's alternating series test are satisfied, the Fourier series converges at x = π/2."
