    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = 4 cos(3x) - 2sin(x) + 5, we will use the chain rule and the basic rules of differentiation.\n\nThe derivative of cos(u) is -sin(u) * u', and the derivative of sin(u) is cos(u) * u'. Here, u = 3x for the first term and u = x for the second term.\n\nFor the first term, u' = d(3x)/dx = 3.\nFor the second term, u' = d(x)/dx = 1.\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of each term:\n\n1. The derivative of 4 cos(3x) is 4 * (-sin(3x)) * 3 = -12 sin(3x).\n2. The derivative of -2sin(x) is -2 * cos(x) * 1 = -2 cos(x).\n3. The derivative of a constant, 5, is 0.\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = -12 sin(3x) - 2 cos(x)."
