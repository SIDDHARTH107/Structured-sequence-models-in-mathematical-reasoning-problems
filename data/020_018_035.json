    "message_2": "To find the optimal strategies for both players and the value of the game, we will use the concept of mixed strategies. Let p be the probability that Player 1 chooses Heads, and q be the probability that Player 2 chooses Heads. Then, the probabilities for Tails are (1-p) for Player 1 and (1-q) for Player 2.\n\nThe expected payoff for Player 1 is given by:\n\nE(Payoff) = p * q * 3 + p * (1-q) * (-2) + (1-p) * q * (-1) + (1-p) * (1-q) * 4\n\nTo find the optimal strategy for Player 1, we will find the value of p that maximizes the expected payoff when Player 2 chooses q optimally. To do this, we will first find the expected payoff as a function of q for each of Player 1's pure strategies:\n\nE(Payoff | Heads) = 3q - 2(1-q) = 5q - 2\nE(Payoff | Tails) = -1q + 4(1-q) = 4 - 5q\n\nPlayer 2 will choose q to minimize the maximum of these two expressions. To find the optimal q, we set E(Payoff | Heads) = E(Payoff | Tails):\n\n5q - 2 = 4 - 5q\n10q = 6\nq = 3/5\n\nNow, we substitute this value of q back into the expressions for the expected payoffs:\n\nE(Payoff | Heads) = 5(3/5) - 2 = 1\nE(Payoff | Tails) = 4 - 5(3/5) = 1\n\nSince the expected payoffs are equal, Player 1 should be indifferent between choosing Heads or Tails. Therefore, the optimal strategy for Player 1 is a mixed strategy with p = 1/2.\n\nNow, we find the optimal strategy for Player 2. We will find the expected payoff for Player 2 as a function of p for each of Player 2's pure strategies:\n\nE(Payoff | Heads) = 3p - (1-p) = 4p - 1\nE(Payoff | Tails) = -2p + 4(1-p) = 4 - 6p\n\nPlayer 1 will choose p to minimize the maximum of these two expressions. Since we already found that the optimal strategy for Player 1 is p = 1/2, we can substitute this value into the expressions for the expected payoffs:\n\nE(Payoff | Heads) = 4(1/2) - 1 = 1\nE(Payoff | Tails) = 4 - 6(1/2) = 1\n\nSince the expected payoffs are equal, Player 2 should be indifferent between choosing Heads or Tails. Therefore, the optimal strategy for Player 2 is a mixed strategy with q = 3/5.\n\nFinally, we find the value of the game by substituting the optimal strategies into the expected payoff function:\n\nE(Payoff) = (1/2) * (3/5) * 3 + (1/2) * (1 - 3/5) * (-2) + (1 - 1/2) * (3/5) * (-1) + (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 3/5) * 4\nE(Payoff) = 1\n\nSo, the optimal strategies for both players are p = 1/2 for Player 1 and q = 3/5 for Player 2, and the value of the game is 1."
