    "message_2": "To find the covariant derivative of the tensor field $T$ with respect to the coordinate vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$, we first need to express the components of $T$ in terms of the local coordinates $(x, y)$. We are given that $T = (xy, y^2, x+y)$, so the components of $T$ are $T^1 = xy$, $T^2 = y^2$, and $T^3 = x+y$.\n\nNow, we can compute the covariant derivative of each component of $T$ with respect to the coordinate vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. In this case, since we are working with a 2-dimensional manifold with no additional structure (such as a metric or connection), the covariant derivative is simply the partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}} T^1 = \\frac{\\partial T^1}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (xy)}{\\partial x} = y$\n\n$\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}} T^2 = \\frac{\\partial T^2}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (y^2)}{\\partial x} = 0$\n\n$\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}} T^3 = \\frac{\\partial T^3}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (x+y)}{\\partial x} = 1$\n\nSo, the covariant derivative of $T$ with respect to the coordinate vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}} T = (y, 0, 1)$"
