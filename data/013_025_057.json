    "message_1": "A group of travelers found two porcelain vases in a shop while they were on vacation in China. They need to decide on the price that they are willing to pay for the vases. The price should be a whole number between $2 and $100. However, the catch is that the price that they pay for the vases will depend on the lowest unique bid submitted by any member of the group. If no one bids a unique amount, the group must pay the highest bid instead. If they all submit the same amount, they must pay that amount as well. \n\nAssuming that there are 5 travelers in the group, what is the optimal bidding strategy for each traveler and what is the expected price that the group would pay for the vases if each member follows the optimal strategy?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal bidding strategy, we need to consider the probability of each bid being the lowest unique bid. Since there are 5 travelers, each traveler has a 1/5 chance of submitting the lowest unique bid. We can calculate the expected value of each bid by multiplying the probability of each bid being the lowest unique bid by the bid amount.\n\nLet's consider the possible bids and their probabilities:\n\n1. If all travelers bid the same amount, they will have to pay that amount. The probability of this happening is 1 (since there's only one way for all travelers to bid the same amount).\n\n2. If one traveler bids a unique amount, the group will pay the lowest unique bid. The probability of this happening is 5 * (1/5) = 1 (since there are 5 travelers and each has a 1/5 chance of submitting the lowest unique bid).\n\n3. If two or more travelers bid the same unique amount, the group will pay the highest bid. The probability of this happening is less than 1 (since there are multiple ways for two or more travelers to bid the same unique amount).\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected value for each bid:\n\n1. If all travelers bid the same amount, the expected value is the bid amount (since the probability of this happening is 1).\n\n2. If one traveler bids a unique amount, the expected value is the bid amount (since the probability of this happening is 1).\n\n3. If two or more travelers bid the same unique amount, the expected value is less than the bid amount (since the probability of this happening is less than 1).\n\nBased on these calculations, the optimal bidding strategy for each traveler is to bid a unique amount between $2 and $100. This will maximize the probability of the group paying the lowest unique bid and minimize the expected price that the group would pay for the vases.\n\nTo find the expected price that the group would pay for the vases if each member follows the optimal strategy, we can calculate the average of the bid amounts:\n\nExpected Price = (Sum of all unique bid amounts) / (Number of unique bid amounts)\n\nSince there are 99 unique bid amounts between $2 and $100, the expected price is:\n\nExpected Price = (2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 100) / 99\n\nExpected Price = (Sum of integers from 2 to 100) / 99\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\n\nWhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nSum = (99 * (2 + 100)) / 2\n\nSum = (99 * 102) / 2\n\nSum = 5046\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected price:\n\nExpected Price = 5046 / 99\n\nExpected Price â‰ˆ 51\n\nSo, the expected price that the group would pay for the vases if each member follows the optimal strategy is approximately $51."
