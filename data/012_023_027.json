    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (i.e., the largest set of vertices in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge).\n\nLet's list the cliques in the given graph:\n\n1. {v1, v2}\n2. {v1, v5}\n3. {v2, v3}\n4. {v2, v5}\n5. {v2, v6}\n6. {v3, v4}\n7. {v3, v6}\n8. {v5, v6}\n\nNow let's look for larger cliques:\n\n1. {v1, v2, v5} - v1 is connected to v2 and v5, v2 is connected to v1 and v5, and v5 is connected to v1 and v2.\n2. {v2, v3, v6} - v2 is connected to v3 and v6, v3 is connected to v2 and v6, and v6 is connected to v2 and v3.\n\nThere are no cliques of size 4 or larger in this graph.\n\nThus, the clique number of this graph is 3, as the largest complete subgraphs are {v1, v2, v5} and {v2, v3, v6}, both of which have 3 vertices."
