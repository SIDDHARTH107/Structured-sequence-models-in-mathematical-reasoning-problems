    "message_2": "To show that the two curves C1 and C2 are birationally equivalent, we need to find a birational map between them. A birational map is a pair of rational functions (f, g) such that f: C1 → C2 and g: C2 → C1 are inverses of each other.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equations of the curves in a more standard form:\n\nC1: (x - 2)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 1\nC2: (x - 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 1\n\nBoth curves are circles with radii equal to 1. C1 has its center at (2, 1) and C2 has its center at (3, 2).\n\nNow, let's find a birational map between these two curves. We can use a projective transformation to map one circle to the other. Let's define the following rational functions:\n\nf(x, y) = ((x - 2) + (y - 1), (x - 2) - (y - 1))\ng(u, v) = ((u + v)/2 + 2, (u - v)/2 + 1)\n\nNow let's check if f and g are inverses of each other:\n\nf(g(u, v)) = f((u + v)/2 + 2, (u - v)/2 + 1) = (((u + v)/2, (u - v)/2))\ng(f(x, y)) = g((x - 2) + (y - 1), (x - 2) - (y - 1)) = ((x + y)/2, (x - y)/2)\n\nAs we can see, f(g(u, v)) = (u, v) and g(f(x, y)) = (x, y), so f and g are inverses of each other. Therefore, the curves C1 and C2 are birationally equivalent, and the birational map between them is given by the rational functions f and g."
