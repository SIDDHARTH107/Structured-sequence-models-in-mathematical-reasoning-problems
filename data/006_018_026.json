    "message_2": "To find the expected number of employees who might be involved in financial fraud, we can multiply the total number of employees in the accounting department by the probability of financial fraud occurring.\n\nExpected number of employees involved in financial fraud = Total employees × Probability of financial fraud\n= 100 × 0.05\n= 5\n\nSo, the expected number of employees who might be involved in financial fraud is 5."
