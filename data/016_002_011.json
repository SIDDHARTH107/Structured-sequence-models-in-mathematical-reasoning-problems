    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively adding smaller equilateral triangles to each side. After each iteration, the number of segments on each side of the snowflake increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nLet's denote the number of segments after n iterations as S(n). After the first iteration, S(1) = 4/3 * 3 = 4. After the second iteration, S(2) = 4/3 * 4 = 16/3. After the third iteration, S(3) = 4/3 * 16/3 = 64/9. After the fourth iteration, S(4) = 4/3 * 64/9 = 256/27.\n\nThe length of each segment after n iterations is given by the original length (3 cm) divided by 3^n. After four iterations, the length of each segment is 3 / 3^4 = 3 / 81 = 1/27 cm.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after four iterations, we multiply the number of segments by the length of each segment: P(4) = S(4) * (1/27) = (256/27) * (1/27) = 256/729 cm."
