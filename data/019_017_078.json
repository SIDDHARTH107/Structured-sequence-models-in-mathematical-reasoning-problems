    "message_2": "To find an element $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that for all $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the following formula is satisfied:\n\n$$(a \\times b) + a = b$$\n\nLet's try to isolate $a$ in the equation. First, we can factor out $a$ from the left side of the equation:\n\n$$a \\times (b + 1) = b$$\n\nNow, let's divide both sides by $(b + 1)$:\n\n$$a = \\frac{b}{b + 1}$$\n\nWe need to find an integer value for $a$ that satisfies the equation for all integer values of $b$. Notice that if we choose $a = -1$, the equation becomes:\n\n$$-1 = \\frac{b}{b + 1}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $(b + 1)$, we get:\n\n$$-(b + 1) = b$$\n\nAdding $b$ to both sides:\n\n$$-1 = 2b$$\n\nHowever, this equation is not true for all integer values of $b$. Therefore, there is no element $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that for all $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the formula $(a \\times b) + a = b$ is satisfied."
