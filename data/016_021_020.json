    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is created by repeatedly applying a specific set of rules to an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the perimeter of the curve increases. \n\nLet's denote the perimeter of the curve after n iterations as P(n). After the first iteration, the original triangle is replaced by three smaller triangles, each with side length 1/2, so the new perimeter is P(1) = 3 * (1/2) = 3/2.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, each side of the curve is replaced by two sides, each of length 1/2 of the original side. Therefore, the perimeter of the curve after n iterations is given by the formula:\n\nP(n) = 3 * (1/2)^n\n\nNow, we want to find the perimeter after 6 iterations:\n\nP(6) = 3 * (1/2)^6 = 3 * (1/64) = 3/64\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the first 6 iterations is 3/64 units."
