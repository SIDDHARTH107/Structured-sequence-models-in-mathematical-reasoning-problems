    "message_1": "Consider a beauty contest game where there are 100 players and each player chooses a number between 0 and 100. The winner of the game is the person whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all the numbers chosen. What number should you choose to have the best chance of winning?",
    "message_2": "To have the best chance of winning, you should try to predict the average number chosen by the other players and then choose a number that is 2/3 of that average.\n\nLet's assume that all players are rational and they know that everyone else is rational as well. In this case, no player would choose a number above 66.67 (2/3 of 100) because the winning number can never be above 66.67. Now, if all players think this way, the new maximum number to choose becomes 2/3 of 66.67, which is approximately 44.44.\n\nThis process of iterated elimination of dominated strategies can be continued. Each time, the maximum number to choose becomes 2/3 of the previous maximum. After several iterations, the maximum number converges to 0.\n\nHowever, in reality, not all players may be perfectly rational or aware of the iterated elimination process. Therefore, it's essential to make an educated guess about the average number chosen by the other players. One approach could be to assume that the numbers chosen by the other players are uniformly distributed between 0 and 66.67. In this case, the average would be 33.33, and 2/3 of that average would be approximately 22.22.\n\nSo, choosing a number around 22.22 could give you the best chance of winning, but it ultimately depends on the behavior of the other players and their level of rationality."
