    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to produce two types of products - Product A and Product B. They have 5 machines which can be used for their production. The time (in hours) required for each machine to produce one unit of each product is given in the table below:\n\n| Machine | Product A | Product B |\n|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|\n|    1    |    2     |    3     |\n|    2    |    1     |    2     |\n|    3    |    3     |    1     |\n|    4    |    4     |    3     |\n|    5    |    2     |    2     |\n\nProduct A sells for $10 per unit and requires 4 hours of machine time to produce, while Product B sells for $15 per unit and requires 5 hours of machine time to produce. The company wants to maximize its profit given that the total machine time available is 25 hours.\n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can make and how many units of each product should they produce to achieve this?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y, subject to the constraint that the total machine time does not exceed 25 hours.\n\nThe constraint can be written as:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 25 (Machine 1)\nx + 2y ≤ 25 (Machine 2)\n3x + y ≤ 25 (Machine 3)\n4x + 3y ≤ 25 (Machine 4)\n2x + 2y ≤ 25 (Machine 5)\n\nWe can find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities. The feasible region is the intersection of all the regions defined by the inequalities. We can then find the vertices of the feasible region and evaluate the profit function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 8.33), (5, 5), (8.33, 0), and (6.25, 3.75). Evaluating the profit function at each vertex, we get:\n\nP(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nP(0, 8.33) = 10(0) + 15(8.33) = $124.95\nP(5, 5) = 10(5) + 15(5) = $125\nP(8.33, 0) = 10(8.33) + 15(0) = $83.3\nP(6.25, 3.75) = 10(6.25) + 15(3.75) = $118.75\n\nThe maximum profit is $125, which occurs when the company produces 5 units of Product A and 5 units of Product B."
