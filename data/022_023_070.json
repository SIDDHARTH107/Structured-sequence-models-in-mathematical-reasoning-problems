    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let u(x, t) = X(x)T(t). Then, the wave equation becomes:\n\nX''(x)T(t) = 9X(x)T''(t)\n\nDivide both sides by X(x)T(t):\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = 9T''(t)/T(t)\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant k:\n\nX''(x)/X(x) = 9T''(t)/T(t) = k\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) X''(x) = kX(x)\n2) T''(t) = (k/9)T(t)\n\nLet's solve the first equation:\n\nX''(x) = kX(x)\n\nThe general solution for this equation is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(sqrt(k)*x) + B*sin(sqrt(k)*x)\n\nNow let's solve the second equation:\n\nT''(t) = (k/9)T(t)\n\nThe general solution for this equation is:\n\nT(t) = C*cos(sqrt(k/9)*t) + D*sin(sqrt(k/9)*t)\n\nNow we have the general solution for u(x, t):\n\nu(x, t) = (A*cos(sqrt(k)*x) + B*sin(sqrt(k)*x)) * (C*cos(sqrt(k/9)*t) + D*sin(sqrt(k/9)*t))\n\nNow let's apply the initial conditions:\n\nu(x, 0) = sin(3πx)\n(A*cos(sqrt(k)*x) + B*sin(sqrt(k)*x)) * (C*cos(0) + D*sin(0)) = sin(3πx)\n(A*cos(sqrt(k)*x) + B*sin(sqrt(k)*x)) * C = sin(3πx)\n\nSince this equation must hold for all x, we can deduce that:\n\nB = 1, sqrt(k) = 3π, A = 0, and C = 1\n\nNow let's apply the second initial condition:\n\n∂u/∂t(x, 0) = 0\n(-3π*A*sin(3π*x) + 3π*B*cos(3π*x)) * (-D/3) = 0\n\nSince this equation must hold for all x, we can deduce that:\n\nD = 0\n\nNow we have the solution for u(x, t):\n\nu(x, t) = sin(3πx) * cos(3πt)\n\nFinally, let's find the value of u(x, 2) at x = 1:\n\nu(1, 2) = sin(3π*1) * cos(3π*2) = sin(3π) * cos(6π) = 0 * 1 = 0"
