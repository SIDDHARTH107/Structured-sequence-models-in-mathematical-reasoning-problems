    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the block matrix method, we first need to partition the augmented matrix into block matrices. The given system can be represented as an augmented matrix:\n\n    [ 1  2  1  3 | 10 ]\n    [ 3 -1 -2  1 |  4 ]\n    [-1  4  3 -2 | 16 ]\n    [ 2 -3  1  4 |  2 ]\n\nNow, let's partition the matrix into block matrices:\n\n    A = [ 1  2 ]  B = [ 1  3 ]  X = [ x ]  C = [10]\n        [ 3 -1 ]      [-2  1 ]      [ y ]      [ 4]\n        [-1  4 ]      [ 3 -2 ]      [ z ]      [16]\n        [ 2 -3 ]      [ 1  4 ]      [ w ]      [ 2]\n\nNow, we can represent the system as AX + BW = C. To solve for X and W, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find A_inv (inverse of matrix A)\n2. Multiply both sides of the equation by A_inv to get X + A_inv * BW = A_inv * C\n3. Solve for X\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse of matrix A:\n\n    A = [ 1  2 ] => A_inv = 1/(-5) * [ -1 -2 ]\n        [ 3 -1 ]                  [ -3  1 ]\n\n    A_inv = [ 1/5  2/5 ]\n            [ 3/5 -1/5 ]\n\nNow, let's multiply A_inv by B and C:\n\n    A_inv * B = [ 1/5  2/5 ] [ 1  3 ] = [ 1/5+6/5  2/5+6/5 ] = [ 7/5  8/5 ]\n                [ 3/5 -1/5 ] [-2  1 ]   [-3/5+2/5 -1/5+3/5]   [-1/5  2/5 ]\n\n    A_inv * C = [ 1/5  2/5 ] [10] = [ 10/5 + 8/5 ] = [18/5]\n                [ 3/5 -1/5 ] [ 4]   [ 12/5 - 4/5 ]   [ 8/5]\n\nNow, we have the equation X + A_inv * BW = A_inv * C:\n\n    X + [ 7/5  8/5 ] [ z ] = [18/5]\n        [-1/5  2/5 ] [ w ]   [ 8/5]\n\nLet's represent this as X + D * W = E, where D = A_inv * B and E = A_inv * C:\n\n    D = [ 7/5  8/5 ]\n        [-1/5  2/5 ]\n\n    E = [18/5]\n        [ 8/5]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix D (D_inv):\n\n    D = [ 7/5  8/5 ] => D_inv = 1/(-2) * [  2/5 -8/5 ]\n        [-1/5  2/5 ]                  [  1/5  7/5 ]\n\n    D_inv = [-1/5  4/5 ]\n            [ 1/10 -7/10 ]\n\nNow, we can find W by multiplying D_inv by E:\n\n    W = D_inv * E = [-1/5  4/5 ] [18/5] = [-18/25 + 72/25] = [ 54/25 ]\n                    [ 1/10 -7/10] [ 8/5]   [  8/50 - 56/50]   [-48/50]\n\n    W = [ 54/25 ]\n        [-24/25]\n\nNow, we can find X by subtracting D * W from E:\n\n    X = E - D * W = [18/5] - [ 7/5  8/5 ] [ 54/25 ] = [18/5 - 378/125 - 432/125] = [ 90/125 ]\n                    [ 8/5]   [-1/5  2/5 ] [-24/25]   [ 8/5 +  24/125 -  48/125] = [ 40/125 ]\n\n    X = [ 18/25 ]\n        [  8/25 ]\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\n    x = 18/25\n    y = 8/25\n    z = 54/25\n    w = -24/25"
