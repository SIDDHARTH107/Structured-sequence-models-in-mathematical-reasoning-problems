In other words, a is a quadratic residue modulo n if it is the square of some integer modulo n.\n\nTo find all the quadratic residues of 13 in the range $0\\leq a<13$, we need to compute the squares of all integers in the range $0\\leq x<13$ modulo 13.\n\nLet's compute the squares modulo 13:\n\n$0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$\n\n$1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n\n$2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$\n\n$3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$\n\n$4^2 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n\n$5^2 \\equiv 25 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}$\n\n$6^2 \\equiv 36 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{13}$\n\nSince 13 is a prime number, the quadratic residues for the range $0\\leq x<13$ will be symmetric around the middle value, so we don't need to compute the squares for 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, as they will give the same residues as 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively.\n\nThus, the quadratic residues of 13 in the range $0\\leq a<13$ are $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12\\}$."
