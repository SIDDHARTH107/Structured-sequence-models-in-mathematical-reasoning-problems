    "message_2": "To find the optimal solution for f(x,y) using the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), we need to implement the algorithm and run it with the given parameters. The WOA is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of humpback whales. It is used to solve complex optimization problems.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the WOA algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a population of whales with random positions within the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale in the population.\n3. Determine the best solution (whale) found so far.\n4. Update the position of each whale using the WOA equations, which are inspired by the humpback whale's behavior, such as encircling prey, bubble-net attacking, and spiral movement.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the maximum number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n\nAfter running the WOA algorithm with the given parameters (population size of 20, maximum number of iterations of 500, and initial search area of [-100, 100] for both x and y), we can obtain the optimal solution for f(x,y) and the corresponding values of x and y.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute code or run algorithms directly. To find the optimal solution, you can implement the WOA algorithm in a programming language like Python and run it with the given parameters. There are also existing WOA implementations available online that you can use as a starting point."
