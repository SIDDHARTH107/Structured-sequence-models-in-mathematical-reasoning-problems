Then, we will use group operation tables to demonstrate the isomorphism.\n\nLet G be a group of order 4. There are two possibilities for the element orders in G:\n\n1. G has an element of order 4.\n2. All non-identity elements of G have order 2.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 4.\nLet a be an element of order 4 in G. Then, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, where e is the identity element. The group operation table for G is:\n\n```\n  e  a  a^2  a^3\ne e  a  a^2  a^3\na a a^2 a^3  e\na^2 a^2 a^3 e  a\na^3 a^3 e  a  a^2\n```\n\nThis table is identical to the operation table for the cyclic group C4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C4.\n\nCase 2: All non-identity elements of G have order 2.\nLet G = {e, a, b, c}, where a, b, and c are distinct non-identity elements. Since all non-identity elements have order 2, we have a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. The group operation table for G is:\n\n```\n  e  a  b  c\ne e  a  b  c\na a  e  c  b\nb b  c  e  a\nc c  b  a  e\n```\n\nThis table is identical to the operation table for the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nSince we have shown that every group of order 4 is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, and these two groups are not isomorphic to each other (as C4 has an element of order 4 while all non-identity elements in V4 have order 2), there are exactly two non-isomorphic groups of order 4: C4 and V4."
