    "message_2": "To solve the complex number equation `z^2 + 8z + 16 = 0`, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n`z = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a`\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 8, and c = 16. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n`z = (-8 ± √(8^2 - 4*1*16)) / 2*1`\n\n`z = (-8 ± √(64 - 64)) / 2`\n\n`z = (-8 ± √0) / 2`\n\nSince the square root of 0 is 0, we have:\n\n`z = (-8 ± 0) / 2`\n\n`z = -8 / 2`\n\n`z = -4`\n\nSo, the complex number equation `z^2 + 8z + 16 = 0` has one solution, which is `z = -4`."
