The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2, C4 × C2\n\nHowever, the question asks to show that every group of order 8 is isomorphic to one of C8, Q8, or D4. This statement is not entirely accurate, as there are two more isomorphism classes as mentioned above. But let's discuss the given three groups.\n\n1. Cyclic group C8: This group has one element of order 8, and it generates the whole group. It is abelian.\n\n2. Quaternion group Q8: This group has elements {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} with the relations i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. It is a non-abelian group with every non-identity element having order 4.\n\n3. Dihedral group D4: This group represents the symmetries of a square and has 8 elements. It is also non-abelian and can be generated by two elements, a rotation r and a reflection s, with relations r^4 = s^2 = 1 and sr = r^(-1)s.\n\nNow, let G be a group of order 8. If G has an element of order 8, then G is cyclic and isomorphic to C8. If G does not have an element of order 8 but has an element of order 4, we can analyze its structure further.\n\nLet x be an element of order 4 in G. Then, the subgroup H generated by x has order 4, and since 4 divides 8, H is a normal subgroup of G. The quotient group G/H has order 2, so there exists an element y in G with order 2 such that y is not in H. Then, G is generated by x and y.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1. If yxy^(-1) = x^(-1), then G is isomorphic to D4.\n2. If yxy^(-1) = x, then G is isomorphic to C4 × C2.\n\nHowever, if G has no elements of order 4, then every non-identity element in G has order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to C2 × C2 × C2.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that some groups of order 8 are isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4, there are also two other isomorphism classes, C2 × C2 × C2 and C4 × C2, that are not covered by these three groups."
