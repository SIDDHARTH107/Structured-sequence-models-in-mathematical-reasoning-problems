    "message_1": "A plane curve $C$ is defined as the zero locus of the polynomial $f(x,y)=x^7 + y^7 - 2$. Let $K_C$ denote the canonical divisor of $C$. What is the degree of $K_C$?",
    "message_2": "To find the degree of the canonical divisor $K_C$, we can use the formula for the degree of the canonical divisor of a plane curve given by:\n\n$deg(K_C) = (d - 1)(d - 2)$,\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the polynomial defining the curve.\n\nIn this case, the polynomial $f(x, y) = x^7 + y^7 - 2$ has degree $d = 7$. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\n$deg(K_C) = (7 - 1)(7 - 2) = 6 \\cdot 5 = 30$.\n\nSo, the degree of the canonical divisor $K_C$ is 30."
