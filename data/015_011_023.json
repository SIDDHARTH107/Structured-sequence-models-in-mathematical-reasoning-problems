    "message_1": "A double pendulum consists of two masses attached to each other by rigid, weightless rods. Consider a double pendulum with mass 1 and mass 2 weighing 1 kilogram and 2 kilograms respectively, attached to each other by rods of length 1 meter and 2 meters respectively. If the double pendulum is initially at rest at a starting position of 30 degrees from the vertical, calculate the maximum angle in degrees that the double pendulum swings away from the starting position before it returns to rest.",
    "message_2": "The dynamics of a double pendulum are highly complex and non-linear. To calculate the maximum angle that the double pendulum swings away from the starting position, we need to consider the conservation of energy in the system. The total energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy of both masses.\n\nLet's denote the angles of the two pendulums from the vertical as θ1 and θ2. The potential energy of the system is given by:\n\nPE = m1 * g * L1 * (1 - cos(θ1)) + m2 * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2)))\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses, L1 and L2 are the lengths of the rods, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²).\n\nThe kinetic energy of the system is given by:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m1 * (L1 * dθ1/dt)² + 0.5 * m2 * ((L1 * dθ1/dt)² + (L2 * dθ2/dt)² + 2 * L1 * L2 * dθ1/dt * dθ2/dt * cos(θ1 - θ2))\n\nThe total energy of the system is:\n\nE = PE + KE\n\nSince the double pendulum is initially at rest, the initial kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the initial total energy is:\n\nE_initial = m1 * g * L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_initial)) + m2 * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_initial)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_initial)))\n\nAt the maximum angle, the double pendulum will also be momentarily at rest, so the kinetic energy will again be zero. Thus, the total energy at the maximum angle is:\n\nE_max = m1 * g * L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_max)) + m2 * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_max)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2_max)))\n\nSince energy is conserved, we have:\n\nE_initial = E_max\n\nGiven the complexity of the equations, it is not possible to solve for the maximum angles analytically. Instead, we can use numerical methods to find the maximum angles. However, without more information about the initial conditions (such as the initial angle of the second pendulum), it is not possible to provide a specific numerical answer."
