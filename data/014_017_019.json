    "message_1": "Consider the following encrypted message: \"htr ymj xfw nx ts ymj qnkj fsi fsi ktw tk ymj xfw ymj qnkj\". Using frequency analysis, what is the most likely letter substitution for the letter \"y\" in this message and what is the likelihood of this substitution?",
    "message_2": "To determine the most likely letter substitution for the letter \"y\" in the encrypted message, we will perform a frequency analysis on the given text. First, let's count the occurrences of each letter in the message:\n\nh: 1, t: 6, r: 1, y: 6, m: 6, j: 6, x: 2, f: 4, w: 2, n: 3, s: 3, q: 2, k: 3, i: 2\n\nNow, let's compare the frequency of the letters in the encrypted message to the frequency of letters in the English language. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. Since \"y\" is one of the most frequent letters in the encrypted message, it is likely to correspond to one of the most common letters in English.\n\nComparing the frequency of \"y\" (6 occurrences) to the frequency of the most common English letters, we can make an educated guess that \"y\" might be a substitution for the letter \"t\" or \"a\" as they are the most common letters in English. \n\nHowever, without more context or additional information, it is difficult to determine the exact likelihood of this substitution. To increase the accuracy of the substitution, we would need to analyze the frequency of other letters in the message and consider the context of the message."
