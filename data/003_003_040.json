    "message_2": "Using the unit circle, the value of sin(π/3) is equal to the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the circle. \n\nFor an angle of π/3 (which is equivalent to 60 degrees), the coordinates of the point on the unit circle are (1/2, √3/2). Therefore, the value of sin(π/3) is √3/2."
