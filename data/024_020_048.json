    "message_2": "The Hopf map, denoted by h, is a continuous map from the 3-dimensional unit sphere M in R^4 to the 2-dimensional unit sphere S^2 in R^3. It is defined as follows:\n\nh: M → S^2\nh(x, y, z, w) = (p, q, r)\n\nwhere\n\np = 2(xw + yz)\nq = 2(yw - xz)\nr = x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - w^2\n\nThe Hopf map is a well-known example of a non-trivial continuous map between spheres, and it plays an important role in the study of differential geometry and topology."
