    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n0.1 & 2.3 & -1.2 & 1 \\\\\n2.2 & -0.9 & 0.7 & 2 \\\\\n1.1 & -1.2 & 3.6 & 3\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix:\n\nStep 1: Multiply the first row by 22 and subtract it from the second row. Also, multiply the first row by 11 and subtract it from the third row.\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n0.1 & 2.3 & -1.2 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -5.3 & 3.3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -14 & 17 & 2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -5.3 and multiply it by 14, then subtract it from the third row.\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n0.1 & 2.3 & -1.2 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -0.6226 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 8.7169 & 2\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nStep 3: Divide the third row by 8.7169.\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n0.1 & 2.3 & -1.2 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -0.6226 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0.2294\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nStep 4: Add 0.6226 times the third row to the second row, and add 1.2 times the third row to the first row.\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n0.1 & 2.3 & 0 & 1.2753 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0.143 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0.2294\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nStep 5: Subtract 2.3 times the second row from the first row, and divide the first row by 0.1.\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0.9615 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0.143 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0.2294\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 0.9615 \\\\\ny &= 0.143 \\\\\nz &= 0.2294\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNow, let's check if the matrix is ill-conditioned. We will calculate the determinant of the matrix:\n\n$$\n\\det(A) = \\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}\n0.1 & 2.3 & -1.2 \\\\\n2.2 & -0.9 & 0.7 \\\\\n1.1 & -1.2 & 3.6\n\\end{array}\\right|\n$$\n\n$$\n\\det(A) = 0.1((-0.9)(3.6) - (0.7)(-1.2)) - 2.3((2.2)(3.6) - (0.7)(1.1)) + (-1.2)((2.2)(-1.2) - (-0.9)(1.1))\n$$\n\n$$\n\\det(A) = 0.1(3.24 + 0.84) - 2.3(7.92 - 0.77) + (-1.2)(2.64 + 0.99)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\det(A) = 0.1(4.08) - 2.3(7.15) + (-1.2)(3.63)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\det(A) = 0.408 - 16.445 + 4.356 = -11.681\n$$\n\nSince the determinant is not close to zero, the matrix is not ill-conditioned."
