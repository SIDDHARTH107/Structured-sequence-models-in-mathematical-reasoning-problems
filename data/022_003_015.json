    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use Cauchy's Integral Formula, which states that for a function f(z) that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, and for any point z_0 inside C, we have:\n\n∮C f(z)/(z - z_0) dz = 2πi * f(z_0)\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the given integral:\n\n∮C (5z^2 + 3z - 1)/((z-1)(z-i)) dz\n\nNow, we need to find the singularities of the function inside the unit circle |z| = 1. The singularities are the points where the denominator is zero, i.e., z = 1 and z = i. However, z = 1 is outside the unit circle, so we only need to consider z = i.\n\nNow, let's apply Cauchy's Integral Formula with z_0 = i:\n\n∮C (5z^2 + 3z - 1)/((z-1)(z-i)) dz = 2πi * f(i)\n\nWe need to find the value of f(i):\n\nf(i) = (5i^2 + 3i - 1)/((i-1)(i-i))\nf(i) = (5(-1) + 3i - 1)/(i-1)\nf(i) = (-5 + 3i - 1)/(-1 + i)\nf(i) = (-6 + 3i)/(-1 + i)\n\nNow, let's multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\nf(i) = (-6 + 3i)(1 + i)/((-1 + i)(1 + i))\nf(i) = (-6 + 3i + 6i + 3)/2\nf(i) = (3 + 9i)/2\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into Cauchy's Integral Formula:\n\n∮C (5z^2 + 3z - 1)/((z-1)(z-i)) dz = 2πi * (3 + 9i)/2\n∮C (5z^2 + 3z - 1)/((z-1)(z-i)) dz = πi * (3 + 9i)\n\nSo, the value of the integral is:\n\n∮C (5z^2 + 3z - 1)/((z-1)(z-i)) dz = πi * (3 + 9i)"
