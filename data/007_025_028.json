    "message_1": "Consider two users, Alice and Bob, who want to establish a common secret key to communicate securely over an insecure channel. Alice chooses a prime number p = 23 and a primitive root α = 5. She also selects a secret key a = 4. Bob chooses a secret key b = 3. Using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, what is the common secret key that Alice and Bob can use to communicate securely?",
    "message_2": "To find the common secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = α^a mod p, where α is the primitive root, a is Alice's secret key, and p is the prime number.\n2. Bob computes B = α^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret key.\n3. Alice computes the common secret key as K_A = B^a mod p.\n4. Bob computes the common secret key as K_B = A^b mod p.\n5. If K_A = K_B, then Alice and Bob have the same common secret key.\n\nLet's calculate the common secret key:\n\n1. A = 5^4 mod 23 = 625 mod 23 = 6\n2. B = 5^3 mod 23 = 125 mod 23 = 10\n3. K_A = 10^4 mod 23 = 10000 mod 23 = 18\n4. K_B = 6^3 mod 23 = 216 mod 23 = 18\n\nSince K_A = K_B, the common secret key that Alice and Bob can use to communicate securely is 18."
