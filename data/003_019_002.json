    "message_2": "To find the integral of cos²(x) from 0 to π/2, we can use the power-reduction formula:\n\ncos²(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2\n\nNow, we can integrate this expression with respect to x from 0 to π/2:\n\n∫[cos²(x) dx] from 0 to π/2 = ∫[(1 + cos(2x))/2 dx] from 0 to π/2\n\nLet's integrate each term separately:\n\n∫(1/2 dx) from 0 to π/2 + ∫(cos(2x)/2 dx) from 0 to π/2\n\nThe integral of 1/2 with respect to x is (1/2)x, and the integral of cos(2x)/2 with respect to x is (1/4)sin(2x). Now, we can evaluate these expressions at the limits of integration:\n\n[(1/2)(π/2) - (1/2)(0)] + [(1/4)sin(2(π/2)) - (1/4)sin(2(0))]\n\n= (π/4) + [0 - 0]\n\n= π/4\n\nSo, the integral of cos²(x) from 0 to π/2 is π/4."
