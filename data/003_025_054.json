    "message_2": "To find the magnitude and direction of the force vector, we can break it down into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components using trigonometry.\n\nThe horizontal component (Fx) can be found using the cosine function:\nFx = F * cos(θ)\nwhere F is the magnitude of the force (50 N) and θ is the angle (30 degrees).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\nθ = 30 * (π / 180) = π / 6 radians\n\nNow, we can find the horizontal component:\nFx = 50 * cos(π / 6) ≈ 43.30 N\n\nThe vertical component (Fy) can be found using the sine function:\nFy = F * sin(θ)\nFy = 50 * sin(π / 6) ≈ 25 N\n\nNow that we have the horizontal and vertical components, we can represent the force vector as:\nF_vector = (43.30 N, 25 N)\n\nTo find the magnitude of the force vector, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\nF_magnitude = √(Fx^2 + Fy^2)\nF_magnitude = √(43.30^2 + 25^2) ≈ 50 N\n\nTo find the direction of the force vector, we can use the arctangent function:\nθ = arctan(Fy / Fx)\nθ = arctan(25 / 43.30) ≈ 0.52 radians\n\nConverting the angle back to degrees:\nθ = 0.52 * (180 / π) ≈ 30 degrees\n\nSo, the magnitude and direction of the force vector are 50 N and 30 degrees with the horizontal, respectively."
