    "message_2": "To find the area of a sector of a circle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle in degrees / 360) × π × radius²\n\nIn this case, the radius is 7 cm and the central angle is 45 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (45 / 360) × π × 7²\n\nArea of sector = (1/8) × π × 49\n\nArea of sector = 49π/8\n\nThe area of the sector is (49π/8) square centimeters."
