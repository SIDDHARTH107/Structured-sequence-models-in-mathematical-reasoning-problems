    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a self-similar fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling ratio.\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal with a scaling ratio of 1:3, the initial square is divided into 9 smaller squares (3x3 grid), and 5 of them form the self-similar pieces (the center square and the 4 corner squares).\n\nSo, N = 5 and s = 3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hausdorff dimension:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the self-similar Vicsek fractal with a scaling ratio of 1:3 and the initial shape being a square with side length of 1 unit is approximately 1.465."
