    "message_2": "To solve for x, follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 7 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:\n3x - 7 + 7 = 8 + 7\n\n2. Simplify the equation:\n3x = 15\n\n3. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:\n3x / 3 = 15 / 3\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\nx = 5\n\nSo, the solution is x = 5."
