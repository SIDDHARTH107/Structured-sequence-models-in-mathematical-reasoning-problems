    "message_1": "The question is: \n\nA support beam that is 10 meters long needs to be designed with a rectangular cross-section. The beam should be strong enough to support a load of 5000 Newtons while minimizing the amount of material used. The height of the cross-section should be twice the width. Find the dimensions of the cross-section that minimize the beam's weight.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use calculus to minimize the volume of the beam while ensuring it can support the given load. \n\nLet the width of the cross-section be x meters and the height be 2x meters (since the height is twice the width). The volume of the beam can be represented as:\n\nV = L * W * H\nV = 10 * x * 2x\nV = 20x^2\n\nNow, we need to find a relationship between the load the beam can support and its dimensions. The strength of the beam can be represented by its moment of inertia, which for a rectangular cross-section is given by:\n\nI = (1/12) * W * H^3\nI = (1/12) * x * (2x)^3\nI = (1/12) * x * 8x^3\nI = (2/3)x^4\n\nThe maximum bending stress the beam can experience is given by:\n\nσ = (M * c) / I\n\nwhere σ is the stress, M is the bending moment, c is the distance from the neutral axis to the outermost fiber, and I is the moment of inertia. In this case, the maximum bending moment M can be represented as:\n\nM = (5000 N * 10 m) / 8\nM = 6250 Nm\n\nThe distance c is half the height of the cross-section, so c = x. Now, we can rewrite the stress equation as:\n\nσ = (6250 * x) / ((2/3)x^4)\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of σ that the beam can withstand. To do this, we will differentiate σ with respect to x and set the result equal to zero:\n\ndσ/dx = 0\n\nDifferentiating σ with respect to x, we get:\n\ndσ/dx = (6250 * (2/3)x^4 - 6250 * x * (8/3)x^3) / ((2/3)x^4)^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\ndσ/dx = (12500x^4 - 50000x^4) / (4/9)x^8\ndσ/dx = (-37500x^4) / (4/9)x^8\n\nSetting dσ/dx equal to zero, we get:\n\n(-37500x^4) / (4/9)x^8 = 0\n\nSince the denominator cannot be zero, we only need to consider the numerator:\n\n-37500x^4 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx^4 = 0\nx = 0\n\nHowever, x = 0 is not a valid solution since it would mean the beam has no width. Therefore, we need to find the critical points of the function by setting the second derivative equal to zero:\n\nd²σ/dx² = 0\n\nDifferentiating dσ/dx with respect to x, we get:\n\nd²σ/dx² = (150000x^3 * (4/9)x^8 - (-37500x^4) * (32/9)x^7) / ((4/9)x^8)^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nd²σ/dx² = (600000x^11 + 300000x^11) / (16/81)x^16\nd²σ/dx² = (900000x^11) / (16/81)x^16\n\nSetting d²σ/dx² equal to zero, we get:\n\n(900000x^11) / (16/81)x^16 = 0\n\nSince the denominator cannot be zero, we only need to consider the numerator:\n\n900000x^11 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx^11 = 0\nx = 0\n\nAgain, x = 0 is not a valid solution. However, since the second derivative is always positive, the function is concave up, which means the minimum value of σ occurs at the endpoints of the domain. In this case, the minimum value of σ occurs when x is as small as possible while still being able to support the load.\n\nSince we do not have a specific value for the minimum stress the beam can withstand, we cannot find an exact value for x. However, we can conclude that the dimensions of the cross-section that minimize the beam's weight are such that the width is as small as possible while still being able to support the 5000 Newton load, and the height is twice the width."
