    "message_1": "A cable firm needs to lay a cable from a power station, located 8 km south of a river, to a small town located 10 km east of the power station on the other side of the river. The cost of laying the cable is $20,000 per kilometer over land and $30,000 per kilometer under the river. Find the most cost-effective route for the cable firm to run the cable.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the point where the cable crosses the river as point C. We can break down the cable route into two parts: the overland part from the power station (point A) to point C, and the underwater part from point C to the small town (point B).\n\nLet x be the distance from point A to point C along the south side of the river. Then, the distance from point C to point B along the east side of the river is (10 - x) km.\n\nThe total cost of laying the cable can be represented as a function of x:\n\nCost(x) = 20,000 * (8 + x) + 30,000 * √((10 - x)² + 8²)\n\nTo find the most cost-effective route, we need to minimize the cost function. To do this, we can find the derivative of the cost function with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Cost)/dx = 20,000 - 30,000 * (10 - x) / √((10 - x)² + 8²)\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation for x:\n\n20,000 - 30,000 * (10 - x) / √((10 - x)² + 8²) = 0\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n30,000 * (10 - x) / √((10 - x)² + 8²) = 20,000\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply and square both sides to get rid of the square root:\n\n(30,000 * (10 - x))² = 20,000² * ((10 - x)² + 8²)\n\nAfter solving the equation for x, we get:\n\nx ≈ 6.4 km\n\nNow, we can find the distance from point C to point B:\n\n10 - x ≈ 10 - 6.4 = 3.6 km\n\nSo, the most cost-effective route is to lay the cable 6.4 km east along the south side of the river, then cross the river and lay the cable 3.6 km east to the small town.\n\nThe total cost of this route is:\n\nCost(6.4) = 20,000 * (8 + 6.4) + 30,000 * √(3.6² + 8²) ≈ $356,000"
