    "message_1": "Two travelers are informed separately about the weight of their luggage. They are asked to declare the weight of their luggage and the one with the heaviest luggage wins a cash prize. However, if their declared weights differ by more than two pounds, then both of them receive nothing.\n\nIf the weight of the luggage of the heaviest traveler is between 50 and 100 pounds, and the prize money is $100, what would be their optimal declared weights to maximize their chance of winning?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their chances of winning, both travelers should declare a weight that is as close as possible to the upper limit of the allowed weight difference (2 pounds) without exceeding it. This way, they increase the likelihood that their declared weights will be within the acceptable range, regardless of the actual weight of their luggage.\n\nAssuming both travelers are rational and want to maximize their chances of winning, they should both declare a weight that is 1 pound less than their actual luggage weight. This way, their declared weights will always be within 2 pounds of each other, ensuring that one of them will win the prize.\n\nFor example, if the heaviest traveler's luggage weighs 75 pounds, they should declare 74 pounds. If the other traveler's luggage weighs 60 pounds, they should declare 59 pounds. In this case, the heaviest traveler would win the prize, as their declared weight is higher, and the difference between the declared weights is within the 2-pound limit.\n\nIn summary, the optimal declared weights for both travelers would be their actual luggage weight minus 1 pound. This strategy maximizes their chances of winning the prize while ensuring that they do not violate the 2-pound difference rule."
