    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line that best fits this data, we will use the simple linear regression method. The equation of a line is given by:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nwhere y is the dependent variable (price), x is the independent variable (size), m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nFirst, we need to find the mean of the x values (sizes) and the mean of the y values (prices):\n\nx_mean = (1000 + 1500 + 2000 + 2500 + 3000) / 5 = 10000 / 5 = 2000\ny_mean = (50 + 75 + 100 + 125 + 150) / 5 = 500 / 5 = 100\n\nNext, we need to find the slope (m). The formula for the slope is:\n\nm = Σ[(x - x_mean)(y - y_mean)] / Σ(x - x_mean)^2\n\nCalculating the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator:\n(1000 - 2000)(50 - 100) + (1500 - 2000)(75 - 100) + (2000 - 2000)(100 - 100) + (2500 - 2000)(125 - 100) + (3000 - 2000)(150 - 100)\n= (-1000)(-50) + (-500)(-25) + (0)(0) + (500)(25) + (1000)(50)\n= 50000 + 12500 + 0 + 12500 + 50000\n= 125000\n\nDenominator:\n(-1000)^2 + (-500)^2 + (0)^2 + (500)^2 + (1000)^2\n= 1000000 + 250000 + 0 + 250000 + 1000000\n= 2500000\n\nNow, we can find the slope (m):\n\nm = 125000 / 2500000 = 0.05\n\nNow, we need to find the y-intercept (b). The formula for the y-intercept is:\n\nb = y_mean - m * x_mean\n\nb = 100 - 0.05 * 2000 = 100 - 100 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the line that best fits this data is:\n\ny = 0.05x\n\nNow, we can use this equation to estimate the price of a 1750 sq. feet house:\n\ny = 0.05 * 1750 = 87.5\n\nThe estimated price of a 1750 sq. feet house is $87,500."
