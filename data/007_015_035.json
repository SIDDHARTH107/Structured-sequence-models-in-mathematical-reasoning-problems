    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. The 13th Mersenne prime number corresponds to the 13th prime exponent n. The first 13 prime exponents are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, and 521. The 13th prime exponent is 521.\n\nNow, we can find the 13th Mersenne prime number using the formula M_n = 2^n - 1:\n\nM_13 = 2^521 - 1\n\nM_13 is a very large number, approximately 6.7 x 10^156. It has 157 digits and is too large to write out in its entirety here."
