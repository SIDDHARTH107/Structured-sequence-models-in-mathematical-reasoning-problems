    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data in ascending order, which is already done: 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 15.\n\nTo find the median, we need to find the middle value(s) of the data set. Since there are 8 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values. In this case, the middle values are 8 and 9. The median is (8 + 9) / 2 = 8.5.\n\nTo find the interquartile range (IQR), we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) and then subtract Q1 from Q3.\n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the data (not including the overall median if the data set has an odd number of values). In this case, the lower half of the data is 6, 7, 8, 8. Since there are 4 data points (an even number), the median (Q1) will be the average of the two middle values, which are 7 and 8. So, Q1 = (7 + 8) / 2 = 7.5.\n\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the data (not including the overall median if the data set has an odd number of values). In this case, the upper half of the data is 9, 10, 10, 15. Since there are 4 data points (an even number), the median (Q3) will be the average of the two middle values, which are 10 and 10. So, Q3 = (10 + 10) / 2 = 10.\n\nNow, we can find the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3: IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 10 - 7.5 = 2.5.\n\nSo, the median for this data set is 8.5, and the interquartile range (IQR) is 2.5."
