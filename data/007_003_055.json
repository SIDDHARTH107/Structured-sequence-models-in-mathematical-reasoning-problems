    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 7^8 is divided by 13, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. We can find the remainder of each power of 7 when divided by 13 and look for a pattern.\n\n7^1 ≡ 7 (mod 13)\n7^2 ≡ 49 ≡ -1 (mod 13)\n7^3 ≡ 7 * 7^2 ≡ 7 * (-1) ≡ -7 ≡ 6 (mod 13)\n7^4 ≡ 7^2 * 7^2 ≡ (-1) * (-1) ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nNow we see a pattern: 7^1 ≡ 7, 7^2 ≡ -1, 7^3 ≡ 6, 7^4 ≡ 1 (mod 13). Since 7^4 ≡ 1 (mod 13), we can rewrite 7^8 as (7^4)^2. \n\n7^8 ≡ (7^4)^2 ≡ 1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^8 is divided by 13 is 1."
