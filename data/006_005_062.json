    "message_1": "A factory produces bolts that have a 5% defect rate. A sample of 200 bolts is taken from the factory. What is the probability that there are less than 10 defective bolts in the sample?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having k defective bolts in the sample\n- n is the sample size (200 bolts)\n- k is the number of defective bolts (we want to find the probability of having less than 10 defective bolts)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k defective bolts from n bolts\n- p is the defect rate (5% or 0.05)\n- 1-p is the probability of a bolt not being defective (95% or 0.95)\n\nWe need to find the probability of having 0 to 9 defective bolts in the sample and then sum these probabilities. \n\nP(X < 10) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the binomial formula and then sum them:\n\nP(X < 10) = Σ [(200Ck) * (0.05^k) * (0.95^(200-k))] for k = 0 to 9\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nP(X = 0) = (200C0) * (0.05^0) * (0.95^200) ≈ 0.000002\nP(X = 1) = (200C1) * (0.05^1) * (0.95^199) ≈ 0.000045\nP(X = 2) = (200C2) * (0.05^2) * (0.95^198) ≈ 0.000405\nP(X = 3) = (200C3) * (0.05^3) * (0.95^197) ≈ 0.002018\nP(X = 4) = (200C4) * (0.05^4) * (0.95^196) ≈ 0.006437\nP(X = 5) = (200C5) * (0.05^5) * (0.95^195) ≈ 0.015267\nP(X = 6) = (200C6) * (0.05^6) * (0.95^194) ≈ 0.027603\nP(X = 7) = (200C7) * (0.05^7) * (0.95^193) ≈ 0.038936\nP(X = 8) = (200C8) * (0.05^8) * (0.95^192) ≈ 0.043824\nP(X = 9) = (200C9) * (0.05^9) * (0.95^191) ≈ 0.039788\n\nNow, summing these probabilities:\n\nP(X < 10) ≈ 0.000002 + 0.000045 + 0.000405 + 0.002018 + 0.006437 + 0.015267 + 0.027603 + 0.038936 + 0.043824 + 0.039788 ≈ 0.174325\n\nSo, the probability of having less than 10 defective bolts in the sample is approximately 17.43%."
