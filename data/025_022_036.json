    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space of cubic curves containing X, we will use the technique of intersection theory.\n\nFirst, let's consider the space of all cubic curves in P^3_k. This space can be parameterized by the coefficients of a general cubic equation, which has the form:\n\nF(x, y, z, w) = a_0x^3 + a_1x^2y + a_2xy^2 + a_3y^3 + a_4x^2z + a_5xyz + a_6y^2z + a_7xz^2 + a_8yz^2 + a_9z^3 + a_10x^2w + a_11xyw + a_12y^2w + a_13xzw + a_14yzw + a_15z^2w + a_16xw^2 + a_17yw^2 + a_18zw^2 + a_19w^3\n\nThere are 20 coefficients (a_0, a_1, ..., a_19), so the space of all cubic curves in P^3_k is a 19-dimensional projective space P^19_k.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that a cubic curve C contains the curve X. This means that the equation F(x, y, z, w) = 0 must hold for all points (x, y, z, w) on X. Since X is a smooth projective curve of genus 2, it has 2g - 2 = 2(2) - 2 = 2 canonical divisors. By the Riemann-Roch theorem, the dimension of the space of canonical divisors is g - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nLet D be a canonical divisor on X. Then, the intersection number of C and X is given by the intersection number of D and the hyperplane section H of C. By the adjunction formula, we have:\n\nC · X = (D + H) · H = D · H + H^2\n\nSince X is embedded in P^3_k, the degree of X is 4 (as it is a curve of genus 2). Therefore, the intersection number C · X = 4. The intersection number H^2 = 3 (since H is a cubic curve), so we have:\n\n4 = D · H + 3\n\nThis implies that D · H = 1. Since the dimension of the space of canonical divisors is 1, the space of cubic curves containing X is a linear subspace of P^19_k of dimension 19 - 1 = 18.\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of cubic curves containing X is 18."
