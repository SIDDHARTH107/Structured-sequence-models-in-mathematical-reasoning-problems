    "message_2": "The edge connectivity of a graph G, denoted by λ(G), is the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph. To determine the edge connectivity, we can use the following inequality:\n\nλ(G) ≤ min{deg(v)} for all vertices v in G,\n\nwhere deg(v) is the degree of vertex v.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific graph G, such as its degree sequence or adjacency matrix, it is not possible to determine the exact edge connectivity. The inequality above only provides an upper bound for the edge connectivity, but the actual value could be lower."
