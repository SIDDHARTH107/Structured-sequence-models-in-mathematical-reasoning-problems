    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane at the point (1, 1, 1), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - 1. Then, we have:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n∂F/∂z = -2z\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1, 1, 1):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, 1, 1) = 2\n∂F/∂y(1, 1, 1) = 2\n∂F/∂z(1, 1, 1) = -2\n\nThe gradient of the surface at the point (1, 1, 1) is given by the vector (2, 2, -2). Now, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the point-normal form:\n\n2(x - 1) + 2(y - 1) - 2(z - 1) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2x + 2y - 2z = 0\n\nNow, we need to determine if the point (1, 1, 1) is a regular point or a singular point on the surface. A point is a regular point if the gradient of the surface at that point is nonzero. Since the gradient at (1, 1, 1) is (2, 2, -2), which is nonzero, the point (1, 1, 1) is a regular point on the surface.\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane at the point (1, 1, 1) is 2x + 2y - 2z = 0, and the point is a regular point on the surface."
