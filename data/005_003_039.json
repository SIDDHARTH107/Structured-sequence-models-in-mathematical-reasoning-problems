The advertising spend for the past 9 months and the corresponding sales data are given below:\n\nAdvertising Spend (in $1000) | Sales (in $1000)\n--- | ---\n20 | 64\n25 | 76\n30 | 87\n35 | 96\n40 | 110\n45 | 122\n50 | 135\n55 | 148\n60 | 160\n\nUsing regression analysis, find the regression equation for the given data and predict the sales for an advertising spend of $47,000.",
    "message_2": "To find the regression equation, we first need to calculate the mean of the advertising spend (X) and sales (Y), as well as the covariance of X and Y and the variance of X.\n\nMean of X (advertising spend) = (20 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 60) / 9 = 360 / 9 = 40\nMean of Y (sales) = (64 + 76 + 87 + 96 + 110 + 122 + 135 + 148 + 160) / 9 = 998 / 9 ≈ 110.89\n\nNow, let's calculate the covariance of X and Y:\n\nCov(X, Y) = Σ[(Xi - X_mean) * (Yi - Y_mean)] / (n - 1)\n\nCov(X, Y) = [(20-40)*(64-110.89) + (25-40)*(76-110.89) + ... + (60-40)*(160-110.89)] / 8\n\nCov(X, Y) ≈ 670.22\n\nNext, let's calculate the variance of X:\n\nVar(X) = Σ[(Xi - X_mean)^2] / (n - 1)\n\nVar(X) = [(20-40)^2 + (25-40)^2 + ... + (60-40)^2] / 8\n\nVar(X) ≈ 266.67\n\nNow, we can find the slope (b) and the intercept (a) of the regression equation:\n\nb = Cov(X, Y) / Var(X) ≈ 670.22 / 266.67 ≈ 2.51\na = Y_mean - b * X_mean ≈ 110.89 - 2.51 * 40 ≈ 10.49\n\nSo, the regression equation is:\n\nY = a + b * X\nY ≈ 10.49 + 2.51 * X\n\nNow, let's predict the sales for an advertising spend of $47,000 (which is 47 in $1000 units):\n\nY ≈ 10.49 + 2.51 * 47 ≈ 10.49 + 117.97 ≈ 128.46\n\nTherefore, the predicted sales for an advertising spend of $47,000 is approximately $128,460."
