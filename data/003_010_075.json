    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (h), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the building (50 meters).\n\nWe have:\n\ntan(60°) = h / 50\n\nTo find the height (h), we can rearrange the equation:\n\nh = 50 * tan(60°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 60 degrees:\n\ntan(60°) ≈ 1.732\n\nSo, the height of the building is:\n\nh ≈ 50 * 1.732 ≈ 86.6 meters\n\nHowever, this height includes the student's eye level, which is 1.5 meters above the ground. To find the actual height of the building, we need to subtract the student's eye level:\n\nActual height of the building ≈ 86.6 - 1.5 ≈ 85.1 meters\n\nRounded to the nearest meter, the height of the building is approximately 85 meters."
