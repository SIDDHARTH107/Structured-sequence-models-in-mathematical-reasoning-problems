    "message_1": "A company has 8 employees who need to be assigned to 4 different projects with exactly 2 employees per project. How many ways can the employees be assigned?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We need to choose 2 employees out of 8 for the first project, 2 out of the remaining 6 for the second project, 2 out of the remaining 4 for the third project, and the last 2 employees will be assigned to the fourth project.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 employees out of 8 is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of employees and k is the number of employees to be chosen.\n\nFor the first project:\nC(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = 28 ways\n\nFor the second project:\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 6! / (2!4!) = 15 ways\n\nFor the third project:\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 4! / (2!2!) = 6 ways\n\nSince the last 2 employees will be assigned to the fourth project, there is only 1 way to do this.\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways for each project to get the total number of ways to assign the employees:\n\nTotal ways = 28 (first project) * 15 (second project) * 6 (third project) * 1 (fourth project) = 2520 ways\n\nSo, there are 2520 ways to assign the 8 employees to the 4 different projects with exactly 2 employees per project."
