    "message_2": "Let's denote the angle of inclination from the top of the flagpole to the bottom of the hill as x. We will use the tangent function to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let's find the height of the hill at the base of the flagpole. We can use the tangent function for the angle of depression:\n\ntan(25°) = height of the hill / 100 meters\n\nheight of the hill = 100 * tan(25°) ≈ 46.63 meters\n\nNow, let's consider the triangle formed by the top of the flagpole, the bottom of the flagpole, and the bottom of the hill. The height of this triangle is the sum of the height of the flagpole and the height of the hill:\n\ntotal height = height of the flagpole + height of the hill\ntotal height = 50 meters + 46.63 meters ≈ 96.63 meters\n\nNow, we can use the tangent function to find the angle of inclination x:\n\ntan(x) = total height / distance to the bottom of the hill\ntan(x) = 96.63 meters / 100 meters\n\nx = arctan(96.63 / 100)\nx ≈ 44.08°\n\nSo, the angle of inclination from the top of the flagpole to the bottom of the hill is approximately 44.08 degrees."
