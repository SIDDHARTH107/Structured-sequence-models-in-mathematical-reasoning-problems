    "message_2": "To find the smooth function $f: S \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,y) = -y$ for all $(x,y) \\in S$, we can integrate the given partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\int \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x,y) dx = \\int -y dx.$$\n\nSince $y$ is treated as a constant with respect to $x$, we have:\n\n$$f(x,y) = -yx + g(y),$$\n\nwhere $g(y)$ is an arbitrary smooth function of $y$.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that $f(x,y)$ is well-defined on $S$. Since $(x,y) \\in S$ implies $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$ as $x = \\pm\\sqrt{1 - y^2}$. We can then rewrite $f(x,y)$ as:\n\n$$f(x,y) = -y(\\pm\\sqrt{1 - y^2}) + g(y).$$\n\nTo make this function well-defined on $S$, we can choose $g(y) = 0$. Thus, the smooth function $f: S \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the given condition is:\n\n$$f(x,y) = -y\\sqrt{1 - y^2}.$$"
