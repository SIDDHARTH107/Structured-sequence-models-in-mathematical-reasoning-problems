    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product of two sets, we form ordered pairs with elements from each set. Let's first find (A × B) × {1} and A × (B × {1}):\n\n(A × B) × {1}:\nFirst, find A × B: {(2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6)}\nNow, find (A × B) × {1}: {((2,5),1), ((2,6),1), ((3,5),1), ((3,6),1), ((4,5),1), ((4,6),1)}\n\nA × (B × {1}):\nFirst, find B × {1}: {(5,1), (6,1)}\nNow, find A × (B × {1}): {(2,(5,1)), (2,(6,1)), (3,(5,1)), (3,(6,1)), (4,(5,1)), (4,(6,1))}\n\nBy the associativity of the Cartesian product, (A × B) × {1} and A × (B × {1}) should be equivalent. To show this, we can rewrite the ordered pairs in a way that makes the equivalence more apparent:\n\n(A × B) × {1}: {((2,5),1), ((2,6),1), ((3,5),1), ((3,6),1), ((4,5),1), ((4,6),1)}\nA × (B × {1}): {(2,(5,1)), (2,(6,1)), (3,(5,1)), (3,(6,1)), (4,(5,1)), (4,(6,1))}\n\nWe can see that the sets are equivalent if we rewrite the ordered pairs in A × (B × {1}) as follows:\n\nA × (B × {1}): {((2,5),1), ((2,6),1), ((3,5),1), ((3,6),1), ((4,5),1), ((4,6),1)}\n\nNow, both sets are the same:\n\n(A × B) × {1}: {((2,5),1), ((2,6),1), ((3,5),1), ((3,6),1), ((4,5),1), ((4,6),1)}\nA × (B × {1}): {((2,5),1), ((2,6),1), ((3,5),1), ((3,6),1), ((4,5),1), ((4,6),1)}\n\nThus, the associativity of the Cartesian product holds for these sets."
