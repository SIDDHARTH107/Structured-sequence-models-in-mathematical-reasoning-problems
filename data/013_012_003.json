    "message_1": "Consider a two-firm Stackelberg competition game. Firm 1 is the leader and sets its output before Firm 2, the follower, chooses its output. The market demand function is Q = 500 - 4P, where P is the price and Q is the total quantity demanded. Firm 1 has a constant marginal cost of $20 per unit, while Firm 2 has a constant marginal cost of $24 per unit.\n\nWhat is the optimal output and price that Firm 1 should choose to maximize its profit? What output and price will Firm 2 select in response, and what will be the total market quantity and price?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the inverse demand function, which expresses the price as a function of quantity. Then, we will find the reaction function for Firm 2, which shows how Firm 2's output depends on Firm 1's output. Finally, we will find the optimal output for Firm 1 by maximizing its profit function, and then determine the corresponding output for Firm 2, the total market quantity, and the price.\n\n1. Inverse demand function:\n\nQ = 500 - 4P\n4P = 500 - Q\nP = (500 - Q) / 4\n\n2. Reaction function for Firm 2:\n\nFirm 2's profit function is given by:\n\nπ₂ = (P - MC₂) * q₂\nπ₂ = ((500 - Q) / 4 - 24) * q₂\nπ₂ = ((500 - (q₁ + q₂)) / 4 - 24) * q₂\n\nTo find the reaction function, we will take the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to q₂ and set it equal to zero:\n\ndπ₂/dq₂ = (500 - 4q₁ - 5q₂) / 4 = 0\n\nSolving for q₂, we get the reaction function:\n\nq₂ = (500 - 4q₁) / 5\n\n3. Optimal output for Firm 1:\n\nFirm 1's profit function is given by:\n\nπ₁ = (P - MC₁) * q₁\nπ₁ = ((500 - Q) / 4 - 20) * q₁\nπ₁ = ((500 - (q₁ + q₂)) / 4 - 20) * q₁\n\nSubstitute the reaction function of Firm 2 into Firm 1's profit function:\n\nπ₁ = ((500 - (q₁ + (500 - 4q₁) / 5)) / 4 - 20) * q₁\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nπ₁ = (500 - 9q₁) / 20 * q₁\n\nTake the first-order derivative of the profit function with respect to q₁ and set it equal to zero:\n\ndπ₁/dq₁ = (500 - 18q₁) / 20 = 0\n\nSolving for q₁, we get the optimal output for Firm 1:\n\nq₁ = 500 / 18 ≈ 27.78\n\n4. Output and price for Firm 2:\n\nUsing the reaction function, we can find the output for Firm 2:\n\nq₂ = (500 - 4q₁) / 5\nq₂ = (500 - 4 * 27.78) / 5 ≈ 22.22\n\n5. Total market quantity and price:\n\nQ = q₁ + q₂ = 27.78 + 22.22 ≈ 50\nP = (500 - Q) / 4 = (500 - 50) / 4 = 112.50\n\nSo, the optimal output for Firm 1 is approximately 27.78 units, and the optimal output for Firm 2 is approximately 22.22 units. The total market quantity is approximately 50 units, and the market price is $112.50."
