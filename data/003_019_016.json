    "message_2": "To find the definite integral of sin(3x) from x = 0 to x = π/6, we first need to find the antiderivative of sin(3x) with respect to x. \n\nLet u = 3x, then du/dx = 3, and dx = du/3.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n∫sin(3x) dx = ∫sin(u) (du/3)\n\nThe antiderivative of sin(u) is -cos(u), so we have:\n\n-1/3 * ∫sin(u) du = -1/3 * (-cos(u)) = 1/3 * cos(u)\n\nNow, we substitute back u = 3x:\n\n1/3 * cos(3x)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\n[1/3 * cos(3x)] from x = 0 to x = π/6\n\n= (1/3 * cos(3 * π/6)) - (1/3 * cos(3 * 0))\n= (1/3 * cos(π/2)) - (1/3 * cos(0))\n= (1/3 * 0) - (1/3 * 1)\n= -1/3\n\nSo, the definite integral of sin(3x) from x = 0 to x = π/6 is -1/3."
