    "message_2": "To solve for $z$, we first need to get all the terms with $z$ on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side. \n\n$(3+4i)z - (2+i) - (5-2i)z = (1+6i)$\n\nNow, we can combine the terms with $z$:\n\n$[(3+4i) - (5-2i)]z = (1+6i) + (2+i)$\n\n$[(3+4i) - 5 + 2i]z = 1+6i + 2 + i$\n\n$(3-5+4i+2i)z = 3+7i$\n\n$(-2+6i)z = 3+7i$\n\nNow, we can solve for $z$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $(-2+6i)$:\n\n$z = \\frac{3+7i}{-2+6i}$\n\nTo get rid of the imaginary part in the denominator, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $(-2-6i)$:\n\n$z = \\frac{(3+7i)(-2-6i)}{(-2+6i)(-2-6i)}$\n\nExpanding the numerator and the denominator, we get:\n\n$z = \\frac{(-6-18i-14i-42i^2)}{(4+12i-12i-36i^2)}$\n\nSince $i^2 = -1$, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$z = \\frac{(-6-32i+42)}{(4+36)}$\n\n$z = \\frac{36-32i}{40}$\n\nNow, we can divide both the real and imaginary parts by the denominator:\n\n$z = \\frac{36}{40} - \\frac{32i}{40}$\n\nSimplifying the fractions, we get:\n\n$z = \\frac{9}{10} - \\frac{4}{5}i$\n\nSo, the solution for $z$ is $z = \\frac{9}{10} - \\frac{4}{5}i$."
