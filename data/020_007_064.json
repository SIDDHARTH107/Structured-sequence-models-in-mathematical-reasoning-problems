    "message_2": "To divide the group of 8 people into 2 teams of equal size (4 people each), we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (8) and k is the number of people in each team (4).\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!(8-4)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4!4!)\n\nC(8, 4) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1) × (4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(8, 4) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(8, 4) = 1680 / 24\n\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\nSo there are 70 different ways to divide the group of 8 people into 2 teams of equal size."
