Given that B∪C = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we can find the elements that are not in A by comparing the two sets.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB∪C = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nThe elements not in A are {0, 6}. Since B and C are both complements of A, they must contain the same elements, which are the elements not in A. Therefore, the unique set that is equal to both B and C is {0, 6}."
