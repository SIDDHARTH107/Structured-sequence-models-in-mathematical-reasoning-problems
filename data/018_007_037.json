    "message_2": "The power set of A, denoted as P(A), is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself. \n\nTo find the power set of A, we list all the possible subsets:\n\n1. The empty set: {}\n2. The subsets with one element: {2}, {4}, {6}\n3. The subsets with two elements: {2, 4}, {2, 6}, {4, 6}\n4. The subset with all three elements: {2, 4, 6}\n\nSo, the power set of A is: P(A) = { {}, {2}, {4}, {6}, {2, 4}, {2, 6}, {4, 6}, {2, 4, 6} }\n\nNow, let's compare the cardinality (size) of A and P(A):\n\nThe cardinality of A is 3, as there are three elements in A: {2, 4, 6}.\nThe cardinality of P(A) is 8, as there are eight subsets in P(A).\n\nSince the cardinality of P(A) (8) is larger than the cardinality of A (3), we have shown that the cardinality of the power set of A is larger than the cardinality of A."
