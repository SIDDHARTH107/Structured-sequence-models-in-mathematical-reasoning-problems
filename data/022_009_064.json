    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms is less than 1, then the series converges. \n\nLet's apply the Ratio Test to our power series:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(x+2)^{n+1}}{(n+1)^2+1}}{\\frac{(x+2)^n}{n^2+1}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x+2)(n^2+1)}{(n+1)^2+1}\\right|$$\n\nNow, we want this limit to be less than 1 for convergence:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x+2)(n^2+1)}{(n+1)^2+1}\\right| < 1$$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the dominant terms are $n^2(x+2)$ in the numerator and $(n+1)^2$ in the denominator:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{n^2(x+2)}{(n+1)^2}\\right| < 1$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{(x+2)}{(1+\\frac{1}{n})^2}\\right| < 1$$\n\nSince the limit does not depend on n, we can remove the limit notation:\n\n$$\\left|\\frac{(x+2)}{(1+0)^2}\\right| < 1$$\n\n$$|x+2| < 1$$\n\nNow, we have found the interval of convergence:\n\n$$-1 < x+2 < 1$$\n\nSubtract 2 from all sides:\n\n$$-3 < x < -1$$\n\nThe radius of convergence is half the length of the interval of convergence:\n\n$$R = \\frac{-1 - (-3)}{2} = 1$$\n\nSo, the radius of convergence is 1, and the interval of convergence is $(-3, -1)$. However, we still need to check the endpoints to determine if they are included in the interval of convergence.\n\nFor $x = -3$:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n}{n^2+1}$$\n\nThis is an alternating series, and since $\\frac{1}{n^2+1}$ is a decreasing sequence that approaches 0, the series converges by the Alternating Series Test.\n\nFor $x = -1$:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2+1}$$\n\nThis series converges by the Comparison Test, as it is smaller than the convergent p-series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}$.\n\nSince both endpoints result in convergent series, the interval of convergence is $[-3, -1]$, and the radius of convergence is 1."
