Find the minimum size of a vertex cover for this graph.\n\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nEdges: {1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 2-5, 3-5, 4-6, 5-6, 5-7}\n\nA vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices such that every edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. \n\nWhat is the minimum number of vertices needed in a vertex cover for this graph?",

Vertex 2 and 5 have the highest degree (4 edges each). We can select either of them, but let's choose vertex 2. Now, we can remove edges 1-2, 2-4, 2-5, and 3-5.\nRemaining edges: {1-3, 4-6, 5-6, 5-7}\n\n2. Vertex 5 has the highest degree (3 edges) among the remaining vertices.

Select vertex 1 and remove edge 1-3.\nRemaining edges: {4-6}\n\n4. Vertex 4 and 6 have the highest degree (1 edge each) among the remaining vertices.

This is the minimum vertex cover for this graph, and it has 4 vertices."
