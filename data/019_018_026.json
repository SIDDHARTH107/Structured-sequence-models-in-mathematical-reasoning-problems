    "message_2": "Let's consider two odd integers, a and b. By definition, an odd integer can be represented as 2n + 1, where n is an integer.\n\nSo, let a = 2n1 + 1 and b = 2n2 + 1, where n1 and n2 are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of a and b:\n\na + b = (2n1 + 1) + (2n2 + 1)\n\nCombine the like terms:\n\na + b = 2n1 + 2n2 + 1 + 1\n\nFactor out the common factor of 2:\n\na + b = 2(n1 + n2) + 2\n\nNow, let's represent the sum as a new integer, c:\n\nc = 2(n1 + n2) + 2\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nc = 2(n1 + n2 + 1)\n\nSince n1 and n2 are integers, their sum (n1 + n2 + 1) is also an integer. Let's call this integer k:\n\nc = 2k\n\nThis equation shows that c is a multiple of 2, which means that c is an even integer. Therefore, the sum of any two odd integers, a and b, is an even integer."
