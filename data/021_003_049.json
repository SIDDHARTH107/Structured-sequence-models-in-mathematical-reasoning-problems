    "message_2": "To estimate the temperature at 25 seconds and 70 seconds using Lagrange interpolation, we will use the formula:\n\nP(x) = L0(x) * f(x0) + L1(x) * f(x1) + ... + Ln(x) * f(xn)\n\nwhere P(x) is the estimated temperature at time x, Lk(x) are the Lagrange basis polynomials, and f(xk) are the given temperature values at the corresponding time intervals.\n\nFirst, we will calculate the Lagrange basis polynomials for each time interval:\n\nL0(x) = (x - x1)(x - x2)...(x - xn) / (x0 - x1)(x0 - x2)...(x0 - xn)\nL1(x) = (x - x0)(x - x2)...(x - xn) / (x1 - x0)(x1 - x2)...(x1 - xn)\n...\nLn(x) = (x - x0)(x - x1)...(x - x(n-1)) / (xn - x0)(xn - x1)...(xn - x(n-1))\n\nNow, we will calculate the estimated temperature at 25 seconds:\n\nP(25) = L0(25) * f(0) + L1(25) * f(20) + ... + L6(25) * f(120)\n\nAfter calculating the Lagrange basis polynomials and plugging in the given temperature values, we get:\n\nP(25) ≈ 104.9\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the estimated temperature at 25 seconds is 105 degrees Celsius.\n\nNext, we will calculate the estimated temperature at 70 seconds:\n\nP(70) = L0(70) * f(0) + L1(70) * f(20) + ... + L6(70) * f(120)\n\nAfter calculating the Lagrange basis polynomials and plugging in the given temperature values, we get:\n\nP(70) ≈ 57.3\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the estimated temperature at 70 seconds is 57 degrees Celsius.\n\nSo, the estimated temperatures at 25 seconds and 70 seconds are 105 degrees Celsius and 57 degrees Celsius, respectively."
