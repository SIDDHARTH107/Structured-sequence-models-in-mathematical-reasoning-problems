Show algebraically that the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with respect to B is not equal to the intersection of the symmetric difference of B and A with respect to B.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In other words, it's the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection between the symmetric difference of A and B and B.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, and then find the intersection between the result and B.\n\nB ∆ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nB ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB ∩ A = {2, 3}\n\nB ∆ A = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection between the symmetric difference of B and A and B.\n\n(B ∆ A) ∩ B = {1, 4} ∩ {2, 3, 4} = {4}\n\nNow, let's compare the two intersections:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ B = {4}\n(B ∆ A) ∩ B = {4}\n\nAs we can see, the intersection of the symmetric difference of A and B with respect to B is equal to the intersection of the symmetric difference of B and A with respect to B. Therefore, the statement in the problem is incorrect. The two intersections are equal."
