    "message_1": "Suppose you are given the equation of a sine wave as: y = 4sin(2x + π/4). Sketch the graph of the function for values of x between 0 and 2π. What is the amplitude of the sine function? What is the period of the function? At what values of x does the function attain its maximum and minimum values?",
    "message_2": "The given equation is y = 4sin(2x + π/4).\n\n1. Amplitude: The amplitude of the sine function is the coefficient of the sine term, which is 4 in this case. So, the amplitude is 4.\n\n2. Period: The period of the sine function is determined by the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 2. The period of the basic sine function is 2π. To find the period of the given function, divide the basic period by the coefficient of the x term: (2π) / 2 = π. So, the period of the function is π.\n\n3. Maximum and minimum values: The maximum and minimum values of the sine function occur when the sine term is equal to 1 or -1, respectively. To find the x values at which this occurs, set the term inside the sine function equal to odd multiples of π/2 (since sin(π/2) = 1 and sin(3π/2) = -1).\n\nFor maximum values, let 2x + π/4 = (2n + 1)π/2, where n is an integer.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = [(2n + 1)π/2 - π/4] / 2 = (2nπ + π - π) / 4 = nπ/2.\n\nFor minimum values, let 2x + π/4 = (2n - 1)π/2.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = [(2n - 1)π/2 - π/4] / 2 = (2nπ - π - π) / 4 = (n - 1)π/2.\n\nSince we are looking for values of x between 0 and 2π, we can plug in integer values of n to find the maximum and minimum values:\n\nFor maximum values:\nn = 0: x = 0 (not in the domain)\nn = 1: x = π/2\nn = 2: x = π (not a maximum, but a minimum)\nn = 3: x = 3π/2\n\nFor minimum values:\nn = 1: x = 0 (not in the domain)\nn = 2: x = π\nn = 3: x = 2π (not in the domain)\n\nSo, the function attains its maximum values at x = π/2 and x = 3π/2, and its minimum value at x = π."
