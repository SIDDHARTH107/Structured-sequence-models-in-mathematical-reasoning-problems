    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using Fourier analysis, we first need to find the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nLet Y(ω) be the Fourier transform of y(t) and C(ω) be the Fourier transform of 2cos(3t). Then, the Fourier transform of the given differential equation is:\n\njωY(ω) + 5Y(ω) = C(ω)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier transform of 2cos(3t). Using the property of Fourier transform for cosine functions, we have:\n\nC(ω) = π[2δ(ω - 3) + 2δ(ω + 3)]\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω) by rearranging the equation:\n\nY(ω) = C(ω) / (jω + 5)\n\nSubstitute the expression for C(ω):\n\nY(ω) = π[2δ(ω - 3) + 2δ(ω + 3)] / (jω + 5)\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Fourier transform of Y(ω) to get the solution y(t). The inverse Fourier transform is given by:\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) ∫[Y(ω) * e^(jωt)] dω\n\nSubstitute the expression for Y(ω) and evaluate the integral:\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2π) ∫[π[2δ(ω - 3) + 2δ(ω + 3)] / (jω + 5) * e^(jωt)] dω\n\ny(t) = (1 / 2) [e^(3jt) / (3j + 5) + e^(-3jt) / (-3j + 5)]\n\nNow, let's analyze the stability of the system based on the Fourier transform. A system is stable if the magnitude of its impulse response (Fourier transform of the output) is bounded. In this case, we have:\n\n|Y(ω)| = |π[2δ(ω - 3) + 2δ(ω + 3)] / (jω + 5)|\n\nThe magnitude of the impulse response is dominated by the Dirac delta functions, which are infinite at ω = ±3 and zero elsewhere. However, the system is stable because the impulse response is finite and integrable. The presence of the term (jω + 5) in the denominator ensures that the system does not have any unbounded behavior for other values of ω."
