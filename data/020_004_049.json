    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two types of products, X and Y, each with a different profit margin. They have limited resources and can only produce a total of 500 units of these products. Product X requires 2 units of resource A and 5 units of resource B to produce, while product Y requires 7 units of resource A and 3 units of resource B to produce. Using quadratic programming, what is the maximum profit the company can generate given the limited resources?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using quadratic programming, we first need to define the objective function and constraints. Let's assume the profit margins for products X and Y are Px and Py, respectively. We want to maximize the total profit, which can be represented as:\n\nObjective function: Maximize P = Px * X + Py * Y\n\nConstraints:\n1. Total units produced: X + Y ≤ 500\n2. Resource A: 2X + 7Y ≤ A (where A is the total amount of resource A available)\n3. Resource B: 5X + 3Y ≤ B (where B is the total amount of resource B available)\n4. Non-negativity: X ≥ 0, Y ≥ 0\n\nHowever, we don't have the values for Px, Py, A, and B. Without these values, we cannot solve the quadratic programming problem. If you provide these values, we can proceed with solving the problem and finding the maximum profit the company can generate given the limited resources."
