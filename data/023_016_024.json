    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 5x - 10 on the interval [-2, 2], we need to compute the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nπx/L) + b_n * sin(nπx/L))\n\nwhere L is half the length of the interval, a_n and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nIn this case, L = (2 - (-2))/2 = 2. So, the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ(a_n * cos(nπx/2) + b_n * sin(nπx/2))\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n. They are given by the following formulas:\n\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * cos(nπx/L) dx\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/2) * ∫[-2, 2] (5x - 10) dx\na_0 = (1/2) * (5/2 * x^2 - 10x) | [-2, 2]\na_0 = (1/2) * [(5/2 * 2^2 - 10 * 2) - (5/2 * (-2)^2 - 10 * (-2))]\na_0 = (1/2) * (0)\na_0 = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/2) * ∫[-2, 2] (5x - 10) * cos(nπx/2) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = 5x - 10, dv = cos(nπx/2) dx\ndu = 5 dx, v = (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\na_n = (1/2) * [(5x - 10) * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2) | [-2, 2] - ∫[-2, 2] 5 * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2) dx]\n\nThe first term in the brackets will be zero because sin(nπ) = 0 for any integer n. So, we are left with:\n\na_n = -(1/2) * (10/nπ) * ∫[-2, 2] sin(nπx/2) dx\n\nNow, integrate sin(nπx/2):\n\na_n = -(1/2) * (10/nπ) * (-4/nπ) * cos(nπx/2) | [-2, 2]\n\nAgain, the result will be zero because cos(nπ) = 1 or -1 for any integer n, and the difference between the limits will be zero. So:\n\na_n = 0 for all n\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/2) * ∫[-2, 2] (5x - 10) * sin(nπx/2) dx\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\nu = 5x - 10, dv = sin(nπx/2) dx\ndu = 5 dx, v = (-2/nπ) * cos(nπx/2)\n\nb_n = (1/2) * [(5x - 10) * (-2/nπ) * cos(nπx/2) | [-2, 2] - ∫[-2, 2] 5 * (-2/nπ) * cos(nπx/2) dx]\n\nThe first term in the brackets will be zero because cos(nπ) = 1 or -1 for any integer n, and the difference between the limits will be zero. So, we are left with:\n\nb_n = (1/2) * 10/nπ * ∫[-2, 2] cos(nπx/2) dx\n\nNow, integrate cos(nπx/2):\n\nb_n = (1/2) * 10/nπ * (2/nπ) * sin(nπx/2) | [-2, 2]\n\nb_n = 10/nπ * [sin(nπ) - sin(-nπ)]\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for any integer n, we have:\n\nb_n = 0 for all n\n\nSo, all the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n are zero. Therefore, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 5x - 10 on the interval [-2, 2] is just a constant function:\n\nf(x) = 0"
