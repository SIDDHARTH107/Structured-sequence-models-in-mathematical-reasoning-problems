    "message_1": "A math student is given a symplectic manifold (M, ω) where M is a 2-dimensional torus and ω is a symplectic form. The student is then asked to find the area enclosed by a certain loop on the torus in terms of ω. Specifically, the loop is given by the following parametrization: \n\nγ(t) = (cos t, sin t, cos 2t, sin 2t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π.\n\nThe student should compute the integral of the 1-form α = γ*ω along this loop and give the answer in terms of ω.",
    "message_2": "To compute the integral of the 1-form α = γ*ω along the loop γ(t), we first need to find the pullback of ω by γ. Since ω is a symplectic form on a 2-dimensional torus, it can be written as:\n\nω = f(x,y,z,w) dx ∧ dy + g(x,y,z,w) dz ∧ dw,\n\nwhere f and g are smooth functions on the torus, and x, y, z, and w are the coordinates on the torus.\n\nNow, we compute the pullback of ω by γ:\n\nγ*(ω) = γ*(f dx ∧ dy + g dz ∧ dw) = f(γ(t)) d(γ*_x) ∧ d(γ*_y) + g(γ(t)) d(γ*_z) ∧ d(γ*_w),\n\nwhere γ*_x, γ*_y, γ*_z, and γ*_w are the pullbacks of the coordinate functions x, y, z, and w by γ. We have:\n\nγ*_x = cos(t), γ*_y = sin(t), γ*_z = cos(2t), γ*_w = sin(2t).\n\nNow, we compute the exterior derivatives of these functions:\n\nd(γ*_x) = -sin(t) dt, d(γ*_y) = cos(t) dt, d(γ*_z) = -2sin(2t) dt, d(γ*_w) = 2cos(2t) dt.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the pullback of ω, we get:\n\nγ*(ω) = f(γ(t))(-sin(t) dt ∧ cos(t) dt) + g(γ(t))(-2sin(2t) dt ∧ 2cos(2t) dt).\n\nNow, we can compute the integral of α = γ*ω along the loop γ(t):\n\n∫_γ α = ∫₀²π f(γ(t))(-sin(t) cos(t)) dt + ∫₀²π g(γ(t))(-4sin(2t) cos(2t)) dt.\n\nTo express the answer in terms of ω, we can write:\n\n∫_γ α = ∫_γ γ*(ω) = ∫_M ω(γ(t))(-sin(t) cos(t) + -4sin(2t) cos(2t)) dt.\n\nThis is the area enclosed by the loop γ(t) on the torus in terms of ω."
