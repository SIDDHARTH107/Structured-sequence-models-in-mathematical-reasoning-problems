The weekly demand for the product is given as follows:\n\n- Week 1: 500 units\n- Week 2: 700 units\n- Week 3: 600 units\n- Week 4: 800 units\n\nThe company can produce a maximum of 1000 units per week, and the cost of production is $1000 per week. What is the optimal production schedule for the company over the next 4 weeks, such that the total cost of production is minimized?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total cost of production, the company should aim to produce the exact number of units required over the 4 weeks, which is 500 + 700 + 600 + 800 = 2600 units. Since the company can produce a maximum of 1000 units per week, they will need to operate for at least 3 weeks to meet the demand.\n\nHere's an optimal production schedule:\n\n- Week 1: Produce 1000 units (500 units for Week 1 demand, 500 units for Week 2 demand)\n- Week 2: Produce 1000 units (200 units for Week 2 demand, 800 units for Week 3 and Week 4 demand)\n- Week 3: Produce 600 units (600 units for Week 4 demand)\n- Week 4: No production needed\n\nIn this schedule, the company operates for 3 weeks, producing a total of 2600 units, which exactly meets the demand for the 4 weeks. The total cost of production is 3 weeks * $1000 per week = $3000."
