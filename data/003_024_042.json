    "message_2": "To find the length of the projection of vector a onto vector b, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection length = |a| * cos(theta)\n\nwhere |a| is the magnitude of vector a, and theta is the angle between vector a and vector b.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of vector a:\n\n|a| = sqrt(5^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(25 + 9) = sqrt(34)\n\nNext, we need to find the angle between vector a and vector b. We can use the dot product formula to find the cosine of the angle between the two vectors:\n\na 路 b = |a| * |b| * cos(theta)\n\nwhere a 路 b is the dot product of vector a and vector b, and |b| is the magnitude of vector b.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of vector a and vector b:\n\na 路 b = (5 * 2) + (3 * 7) = 10 + 21 = 31\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of vector b:\n\n|b| = sqrt(2^2 + 7^2) = sqrt(4 + 49) = sqrt(53)\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle between the two vectors:\n\ncos(theta) = (a 路 b) / (|a| * |b|) = 31 / (sqrt(34) * sqrt(53))\n\nFinally, we can find the length of the projection of vector a onto vector b:\n\nProjection length = |a| * cos(theta) = sqrt(34) * (31 / (sqrt(34) * sqrt(53))) = 31 / sqrt(53)\n\nSo, the length of the projection of vector a onto vector b is 31 / sqrt(53)."
