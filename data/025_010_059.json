    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the vector space H^0(C, L) of global sections of L over C, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a line bundle L on a smooth projective curve C of genus g, the following equation holds:\n\nl(L) - l(K_C - L) = d - g + 1,\n\nwhere l(L) is the dimension of the vector space H^0(C, L), K_C is the canonical divisor of C, and d is the degree of L.\n\nIn our case, the genus g is 3, and the degree d of the line bundle L is 5. The canonical divisor K_C has degree 2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4. Now we can compute l(K_C - L):\n\nl(K_C - L) = l(K_C) - l(L) = 4 - 5 = -1.\n\nSince l(K_C - L) cannot be negative, we have l(K_C - L) = 0. Now we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem to find l(L):\n\nl(L) - 0 = 5 - 3 + 1,\nl(L) = 3.\n\nThus, the dimension of the vector space H^0(C, L) of global sections of L over C is 3."
