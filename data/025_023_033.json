    "message_1": "Let X be a complex projective algebraic variety defined by a system of homogeneous polynomial equations, and let Y be a smooth algebraic subvariety of X. Suppose that the intersection cohomology groups of X and Y with coefficients in the field of complex numbers are given by:\n\nIH^i(X, C) = { 1, 0, 1 } if i = 0, 2, 4\nIH^i(X, C) = 0 if i is odd\n\nIH^i(Y, C) = { 1, 0 } if i = 0, 2\nIH^i(Y, C) = 0 if i is odd\n\nFind the dimension of the middle-dimensional intersection cohomology group IH^2(X ∩ Y, C).",
    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the middle-dimensional intersection cohomology group IH^2(X ∩ Y, C), we need to consider the intersection of X and Y, denoted as Z = X ∩ Y. Since Y is a smooth algebraic subvariety of X, the intersection Z will also be a complex projective algebraic variety.\n\nThe Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that for a smooth projective variety Y of dimension n and a generic hyperplane section X, the restriction map H^i(Y, C) → H^i(X, C) is an isomorphism for i < n and injective for i = n. In our case, we have:\n\nIH^i(X, C) = { 1, 0, 1 } if i = 0, 2, 4\nIH^i(Y, C) = { 1, 0 } if i = 0, 2\n\nSince Y is a smooth subvariety of X, the dimension of Y is less than the dimension of X. Let's denote the dimension of Y as n and the dimension of X as m. Then, we have:\n\nn < m\n\nFrom the given intersection cohomology groups, we can see that the middle-dimensional intersection cohomology group for Y is IH^2(Y, C) = 0, which means that n = 2. Similarly, the middle-dimensional intersection cohomology group for X is IH^4(X, C) = 1, which means that m = 4.\n\nNow, we need to find the dimension of the middle-dimensional intersection cohomology group IH^2(Z, C), where Z = X ∩ Y. Since Z is the intersection of X and Y, its dimension will be less than or equal to the minimum of the dimensions of X and Y. In this case, the dimension of Z is at most 2.\n\nSince IH^2(Y, C) = 0 and IH^4(X, C) = 1, the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem implies that the restriction map H^2(Y, C) → H^2(X, C) is injective. Therefore, the dimension of IH^2(Z, C) is at least 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the dimension of the middle-dimensional intersection cohomology group IH^2(X ∩ Y, C) is 1."
