Use the theorem that states \"if a prime factor of the order of a finite group G is congruent to 1 mod 4, then G has a normal subgroup of index 2\".",
    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 30. We know that 30 = 2 * 3 * 5, so the prime factors of the order of G are 2, 3, and 5. By the Sylow theorems, we know that there exist Sylow subgroups of orders 2, 3, and 5 in G. Let P_2, P_3, and P_5 be Sylow subgroups of orders 2, 3, and 5, respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the index of these Sylow subgroups in G. By the Sylow theorems, the index of P_5 in G must divide 6 (since 30/5 = 6), and the index must be congruent to 1 mod 5. The only possibility is that the index of P_5 is 1, which means that P_5 is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSimilarly, the index of P_3 in G must divide 10 (since 30/3 = 10), and the index must be congruent to 1 mod 3. The only possibilities are 1 and 10. If the index of P_3 is 1, then P_3 is a normal subgroup of G. If the index is 10, then by the theorem given, G has a normal subgroup of index 2, which we will denote as N.\n\nNow, we have three cases to consider:\n\n1. P_3 is normal in G:\nIn this case, both P_3 and P_5 are normal subgroups of G, and their intersection is trivial (since their orders are coprime). By the direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_3 and P_5, which is C3 Ã— C5, and this is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30.\n\n2. P_3 is not normal in G, and N is abelian:\nIn this case, we have a normal subgroup N of index 2 in G. Since N has order 15, it must be isomorphic to C15 (as 15 is the product of two distinct primes). Now, since N is abelian and has index 2 in G, G must be a semidirect product of N and a subgroup of order 2. This is the dihedral group D15.\n\n3. P_3 is not normal in G, and N is non-abelian:\nIn this case, we have a normal subgroup N of index 2 in G, and N is non-abelian. Since N has order 15, it must be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 15. Now, since N is non-abelian and has index 2 in G, G must be a semidirect product of N and a subgroup of order 2. This is the non-abelian group of order 30.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C30, the dihedral group D15, or the non-abelian group of order 30."
