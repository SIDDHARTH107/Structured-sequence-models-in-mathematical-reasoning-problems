If there are an even number of data points, then the median is the average of the two middle values.)",
    "message_2": "First, we need to arrange the data set in ascending order:\n\n17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 31, 34, 36, 39, 41\n\nSince there are 13 data points (an odd number), the median will be the middle value. In this case, the median is the 7th value:\n\n17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, (26), 28, 31, 34, 36, 39, 41\n\nSo, the median of this data set is 26."
