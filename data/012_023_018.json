    "message_2": "To find the maximum size of a clique in a graph G with 9 vertices and 15 edges, we can use the Turán's theorem. The theorem states that the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph that does not contain a clique of size r+1 is given by:\n\nT(n, r) = (r-1)n^2 / (2r)\n\nIn our case, we have 15 edges and 9 vertices. We want to find the largest r such that T(9, r) ≤ 15.\n\nLet's test for r = 3:\n\nT(9, 3) = (3-1) * 9^2 / (2 * 3) = 2 * 81 / 6 = 27\n\nSince 27 > 15, we need to test for a smaller r. Let's try r = 2:\n\nT(9, 2) = (2-1) * 9^2 / (2 * 2) = 1 * 81 / 4 = 20.25\n\nSince 20.25 > 15, we need to test for an even smaller r. Let's try r = 1:\n\nT(9, 1) = (1-1) * 9^2 / (2 * 1) = 0 * 81 / 2 = 0\n\nSince 0 < 15, we can conclude that the maximum size of a clique in a graph G with 9 vertices and 15 edges is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nTo construct such a clique, we can simply create a graph with 9 vertices and connect any two vertices with an edge. This will create a clique of size 2."
