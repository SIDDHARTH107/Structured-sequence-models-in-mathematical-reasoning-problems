    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform F(ω) of the function f(t) = cos(10πt) + sin(20πt), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over all t.\n\nLet's first find the Fourier transform of each term separately:\n\n1) For the first term, cos(10πt):\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[cos(10πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite cos(10πt) as:\n\ncos(10πt) = (1/2) * [e^(j10πt) + e^(-j10πt)]\n\nSo, F1(ω) = (1/2) * ∫[(e^(j10πt) + e^(-j10πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF1(ω) = (1/2) * [∫[e^(j(10π-ω)t)] dt + ∫[e^(-j(10π+ω)t)] dt]\n\nBoth integrals are of the form ∫[e^(jat)] dt, which evaluates to (1/ja) * e^(jat). Therefore,\n\nF1(ω) = (1/2) * [(1/j(10π-ω)) * e^(j(10π-ω)t) + (1/j(10π+ω)) * e^(-j(10π+ω)t)] evaluated from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince the integral converges only when ω = 10π, we have:\n\nF1(ω) = (1/2) * δ(ω - 10π) - (1/2) * δ(ω + 10π)\n\n2) For the second term, sin(20πt):\n\nF2(ω) = ∫[sin(20πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nUsing the Euler's formula, we can rewrite sin(20πt) as:\n\nsin(20πt) = (1/2j) * [e^(j20πt) - e^(-j20πt)]\n\nSo, F2(ω) = (1/2j) * ∫[(e^(j20πt) - e^(-j20πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\nF2(ω) = (1/2j) * [∫[e^(j(20π-ω)t)] dt - ∫[e^(-j(20π+ω)t)] dt]\n\nBoth integrals are of the form ∫[e^(jat)] dt, which evaluates to (1/ja) * e^(jat). Therefore,\n\nF2(ω) = (1/2j) * [(1/j(20π-ω)) * e^(j(20π-ω)t) - (1/j(20π+ω)) * e^(-j(20π+ω)t)] evaluated from -∞ to ∞\n\nSince the integral converges only when ω = 20π, we have:\n\nF2(ω) = (1/2j) * δ(ω - 20π) - (1/2j) * δ(ω + 20π)\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform F(ω) of the original function by adding F1(ω) and F2(ω):\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω) = (1/2) * δ(ω - 10π) - (1/2) * δ(ω + 10π) + (1/2j) * δ(ω - 20π) - (1/2j) * δ(ω + 20π)\n\nThe Fourier transform F(ω) has non-zero values only at ω = ±10π and ω = ±20π, which correspond to the frequencies present in the original function f(t) = cos(10πt) + sin(20πt). Therefore, there are no additional frequency components in the Fourier transform other than the ones present in the original function."
