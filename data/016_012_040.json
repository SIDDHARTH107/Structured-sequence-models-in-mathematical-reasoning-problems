    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a given space (in this case, a unit square). It was first introduced by Giuseppe Peano in 1890. The curve is constructed through an iterative process, with each iteration increasing the complexity of the curve.\n\nSince the Peano curve is a space-filling curve, it has an infinite length over any interval, including the interval [0,1]. This is because the curve becomes more and more intricate with each iteration, and its length increases without bound."
