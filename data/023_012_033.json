The function is defined as:\n\nf(x) = { 2x + 1, for -π < x < 0\n       { -2x + 1, for 0 < x < π\n\nFirst, let's find the average value of the function, a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\nSince the function is piecewise, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (2x + 1) dx + ∫[0, π] (-2x + 1) dx]\n\nNow, let's solve the integrals:\n\n∫[-π, 0] (2x + 1) dx = [x² + x] (from -π to 0) = 0 - (-π² + π) = π² - π\n∫[0, π] (-2x + 1) dx = [-x² + x] (from 0 to π) = -π² + π\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation for a₀:\n\na₀ = (1/π) * [(π² - π) + (-π² + π)] = (1/π) * 0 = 0\n\nNext, let's find the coefficients aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\n\nAgain, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (2x + 1) cos(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] (-2x + 1) cos(nx) dx]\n\nNow, let's solve the integrals using integration by parts:\n\n∫[-π, 0] (2x + 1) cos(nx) dx = [(2x + 1) * (sin(nx)/n) + (2/n) * ∫ sin(nx) dx] (from -π to 0)\n= [(2x + 1) * (sin(nx)/n) - (2/n²) * cos(nx)] (from -π to 0)\n= [0 - (-2π + 1) * (0) - (2/n²) * (1 - cos(nπ))] = (2/n²) * (1 - cos(nπ))\n\n∫[0, π] (-2x + 1) cos(nx) dx = [(-2x + 1) * (sin(nx)/n) - (2/n) * ∫ sin(nx) dx] (from 0 to π)\n= [(-2x + 1) * (sin(nx)/n) - (2/n²) * cos(nx)] (from 0 to π)\n= [(-2π + 1) * (0) - (2/n²) * (cos(nπ) - 1)] = (2/n²) * (cos(nπ) - 1)\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation for aₙ:\n\naₙ = (1/π) * [(2/n²) * (1 - cos(nπ)) + (2/n²) * (cos(nπ) - 1)] = 0\n\nFinally, let's find the coefficients bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nAgain, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [∫[-π, 0] (2x + 1) sin(nx) dx + ∫[0, π] (-2x + 1) sin(nx) dx]\n\nNow, let's solve the integrals using integration by parts:\n\n∫[-π, 0] (2x + 1) sin(nx) dx = [(2x + 1) * (-cos(nx)/n) - (2/n) * ∫ -cos(nx) dx] (from -π to 0)\n= [(2x + 1) * (-cos(nx)/n) + (2/n²) * sin(nx)] (from -π to 0)\n= [0 - (-2π + 1) * (1) + (2/n²) * (0)] = 2π - 1\n\n∫[0, π] (-2x + 1) sin(nx) dx = [(-2x + 1) * (-cos(nx)/n) + (2/n) * ∫ cos(nx) dx] (from 0 to π)\n= [(-2x + 1) * (-cos(nx)/n) - (2/n²) * sin(nx)] (from 0 to π)\n= [(-2π + 1) * (-1) - (2/n²) * (0)] = 2π - 1\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation for bₙ:\n\nbₙ = (1/π) * [(2π - 1) + (2π - 1)] = (2/π) * (2π - 1)\n\nNow, we have all the coefficients:\n\na₀ = 0\naₙ = 0\nbₙ = (2/π) * (2π - 1)\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the given function is:\n\nf(x) = ∑[n=1 to ∞] [(2/π) * (2π - 1) * sin(nx)]"
