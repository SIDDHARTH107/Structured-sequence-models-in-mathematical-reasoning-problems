Using higher-order logic, write an expression for the function g that takes in a set of integers and returns the sum of the squares of only the even numbers in the set. \n\nThen, using the function g, find the sum of the squares of even integers between 3 and 8 (both inclusive).",
    "message_2": "Let X be the set of integers from 1 to 10. Define a function f: X -> Y, where Y is the set of integers, such that f(x) = x^2 for all x in X.\n\nNow, let's define the function g: X -> Y, where g(x) = f(x) if x is even, and g(x) = 0 if x is odd. In other words, g(x) = x^2 if x is even, and g(x) = 0 if x is odd.\n\nNow, we want to find the sum of the squares of even integers between 3 and 8 (both inclusive). The even integers in this range are 4 and 6. Using the function g, we have:\n\ng(4) = 4^2 = 16\ng(6) = 6^2 = 36\n\nSo, the sum of the squares of even integers between 3 and 8 (both inclusive) is 16 + 36 = 52."
