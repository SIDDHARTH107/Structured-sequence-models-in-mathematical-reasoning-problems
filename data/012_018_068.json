    "message_2": "To disconnect a graph completely, we need to ensure that no two vertices are connected by an edge. In other words, we need to remove enough edges so that the graph becomes a set of isolated vertices.\n\nA graph with 10 vertices can have a maximum of C(10, 2) edges, where C(n, k) denotes the number of combinations of choosing k elements from a set of n elements. C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 45.\n\nHowever, we don't need to remove all 45 edges to disconnect the graph completely. To disconnect the graph, we can remove edges in such a way that each vertex loses its connection to the other vertices one by one. \n\nTo disconnect the first vertex, we need to remove all its edges. Since it can have a maximum of 9 edges (connecting to the other 9 vertices), we remove 9 edges. Now, we have 9 vertices left.\n\nTo disconnect the second vertex, we need to remove its edges to the remaining 8 vertices. However, we have already removed the edge connecting it to the first vertex, so we only need to remove 7 more edges. \n\nContinuing this process, we get the following number of edges to remove for each vertex:\n\n9 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 37\n\nSo, the minimum number of edges that must be removed from a graph containing 10 vertices to disconnect it completely is 37."
