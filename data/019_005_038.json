    "message_1": "Consider a group of five friends, Alex, Ben, Chris, Dave, and Evan. Alex knows that Ben is wearing either a red or blue shirt, but he is unsure which one. Similarly, Ben knows that Chris is wearing one of two hats, but he is unsure which one. Chris knows that Dave has a single-digit number written on his hand, but he doesn't know what it is. Finally, Dave knows that Evan is holding a card with a letter on it, but he doesn't know what letter it is. How many possible color-shirt-hat-number-letter combinations are there based on what each person knows?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of possible combinations, we can multiply the number of possibilities for each person's knowledge.\n\n1. Ben's shirt: 2 possibilities (red or blue)\n2. Chris's hat: 2 possibilities (let's assume Hat 1 or Hat 2)\n3. Dave's number: 10 possibilities (single-digit numbers are 0-9)\n4. Evan's letter: 26 possibilities (assuming English alphabet, with 26 letters)\n\nNow, multiply the possibilities together: 2 (shirt) * 2 (hat) * 10 (number) * 26 (letter) = 1040 possible combinations."
