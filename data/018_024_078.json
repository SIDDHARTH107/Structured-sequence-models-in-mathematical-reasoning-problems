    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA ∩ B = {3, 4}\n\nSo, A ∆ B = {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the symmetric difference. The complement of a set is the set of all elements that are not in the given set. Since we don't have a universal set defined, let's assume the universal set U is the union of A and B, which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\n(A ∆ B)' = U - (A ∆ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 2, 5} = {3, 4}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference of A and B is not distributive over complement. To show this, we need to show that:\n\n(A ∆ B)' ≠ (A' ∆ B')\n\nFirst, let's find the complements of A and B with respect to the universal set U:\n\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {1, 2, 3, 4} = {5}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B':\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B') = ({5} ∪ {1, 2}) - {} = {1, 2, 5}\n\nComparing the two sets:\n\n(A ∆ B)' = {3, 4}\n(A' ∆ B') = {1, 2, 5}\n\nSince (A ∆ B)' ≠ (A' ∆ B'), we have proven that the symmetric difference of A and B is not distributive over complement."
