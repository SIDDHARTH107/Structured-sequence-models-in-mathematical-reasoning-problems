    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using a rail fence cipher with 3 rails, we write the message in a zigzag pattern along the rails and then read the message along each rail from left to right. Here's how the message would look like in the zigzag pattern:\n\nH . . . O . . . R . . .\n. E . L . W . L . D .\n. . L . . . O . . . .\n\nNow, read the message along each rail from left to right:\n\nHOLEWREDLO\n\nSo, the encrypted message is \"HOLEWREDLO\"."
