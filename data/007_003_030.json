    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 2314 is divided by 7 using modular arithmetic, we can break down the number into smaller components and find their remainders when divided by 7. Then, we can add those remainders together and find the final remainder.\n\n2314 can be written as: 2000 + 300 + 10 + 4\n\nNow, let's find the remainders of each component when divided by 7:\n\n2000 % 7 = 6 (since 1998 is the closest multiple of 7)\n300 % 7 = 2 (since 294 is the closest multiple of 7)\n10 % 7 = 3 (since 7 is the closest multiple of 7)\n4 % 7 = 4 (since 0 is the closest multiple of 7)\n\nNow, let's add the remainders together:\n\n6 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 15\n\nFinally, let's find the remainder when 15 is divided by 7:\n\n15 % 7 = 1\n\nSo, the remainder when 2314 is divided by 7 is 1."
