    "message_2": "To determine the rank of matrix A, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing Gaussian elimination to row reduce the matrix to its row echelon form.\n\nStarting with matrix A:\n\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ \n2 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n3 & 6 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSubtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 6 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSubtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} \n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow the matrix is in row echelon form. We can see that there is only one linearly independent row (the first row). Therefore, the rank of matrix A is 1."
