    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order p^n * m (where p is a prime and p does not divide m) is congruent to 1 mod p and divides m.\n\nThe prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3. So, we need to find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- n_2 = 1 (mod 2) and n_2 | 3\n- n_2 can be 1 or 3\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- n_3 = 1 (mod 3) and n_3 | 16\n- n_3 can be 1 or 4\n\nNow, we can use these possibilities to find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which is a cyclic group of order 48, denoted as C48.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and one Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, we have two non-isomorphic groups: the semidirect product of C16 and C3, denoted as C16 ⋊ C3, and the semidirect product of Q16 (the generalized quaternion group of order 16) and C3, denoted as Q16 ⋊ C3.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, the group is a semidirect product of C16 and C2, denoted as C16 ⋊ C2.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, we have one non-isomorphic group: the semidirect product of Q16 and C2, denoted as Q16 ⋊ C2.\n\nIn total, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 48: C48, C16 ⋊ C3, Q16 ⋊ C3, C16 ⋊ C2, and Q16 ⋊ C2.\n\nNow, let's determine whether each of the non-abelian groups is isomorphic to C48 or A4 × C4:\n\n1. C16 ⋊ C3: This group is non-abelian and has order 48, so it cannot be isomorphic to the abelian group C48. It also has a different structure than A4 × C4, so it is not isomorphic to A4 × C4.\n\n2. Q16 ⋊ C3: This group is non-abelian and has order 48, so it cannot be isomorphic to C48. It also has a different structure than A4 × C4, so it is not isomorphic to A4 × C4.\n\n3. C16 ⋊ C2: This group is non-abelian and has order 48, so it cannot be isomorphic to C48. It also has a different structure than A4 × C4, so it is not isomorphic to A4 × C4.\n\n4. Q16 ⋊ C2: This group is non-abelian and has order 48, so it cannot be isomorphic to C48. It also has a different structure than A4 × C4, so it is not isomorphic to A4 × C4.\n\nNone of the non-abelian groups of order 48 are isomorphic to C48 or A4 × C4."
