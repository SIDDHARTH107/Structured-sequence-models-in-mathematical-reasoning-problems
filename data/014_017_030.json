    "message_1": "In a ciphertext message generated using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, the letter \"E\" appears 35 times out of a total of 400 letters. Determine the frequency of occurrence of the letter \"E\" in the corresponding plaintext message.",
    "message_2": "In a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a corresponding letter in the ciphertext. The frequency of a letter in the ciphertext should be the same as the frequency of the corresponding letter in the plaintext.\n\nIn this case, the letter \"E\" appears 35 times out of a total of 400 letters in the ciphertext. To determine the frequency of occurrence of the letter \"E\" in the plaintext message, we can calculate the proportion of \"E\" in the ciphertext:\n\nFrequency of \"E\" = (Number of times \"E\" appears) / (Total number of letters)\nFrequency of \"E\" = 35 / 400\n\nNow, we can convert this fraction to a percentage:\n\nFrequency of \"E\" = (35 / 400) * 100\nFrequency of \"E\" â‰ˆ 8.75%\n\nSo, the frequency of occurrence of the letter \"E\" in the corresponding plaintext message is approximately 8.75%."
