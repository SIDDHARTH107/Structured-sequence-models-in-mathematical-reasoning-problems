    "message_1": "Suppose there are 8 books on a shelf, out of which 3 are maths books, 2 are history books, 2 are biology books, and 1 is an art book. In how many ways can a student select 4 books from the shelf such that at least one book is from each category?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. We will first calculate the total number of ways to select 4 books from the 8 books without any restrictions. Then, we will subtract the number of ways in which at least one category is not represented.\n\n1. Total number of ways to select 4 books from 8 books without any restrictions:\nThis can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8-4)!)\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * 4!)\nC(8, 4) = 70\n\n2. Number of ways in which at least one category is not represented:\nThere are 3 cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: No maths books are selected.\nIn this case, we have to select 4 books from the remaining 5 books (2 history, 2 biology, and 1 art).\nC(5, 4) = 5\n\nCase 2: No history books are selected.\nIn this case, we have to select 4 books from the remaining 6 books (3 maths, 2 biology, and 1 art).\nC(6, 4) = 15\n\nCase 3: No biology books are selected.\nIn this case, we have to select 4 books from the remaining 6 books (3 maths, 2 history, and 1 art).\nC(6, 4) = 15\n\nHowever, we have over-counted the case where no maths, history, or biology books are selected (i.e., only the art book is selected). We need to add this case back in.\n\nCase 4: Only the art book is selected.\nThis case is not possible, as the student needs to select 4 books, and there is only 1 art book.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of ways in which at least one category is not represented:\n5 + 15 + 15 = 35\n\n3. Number of ways to select 4 books such that at least one book is from each category:\nTotal number of ways without any restrictions - Number of ways in which at least one category is not represented\n70 - 35 = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 ways in which a student can select 4 books from the shelf such that at least one book is from each category."
