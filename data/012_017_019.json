    "message_2": "To determine whether the graph G with 8 vertices and 12 edges has a perfect matching, we can use Tutte's theorem. Tutte's theorem states that a graph has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset U of its vertices, the number of odd components of the subgraph induced by the vertices not in U is less than or equal to the size of U.\n\nSince we don't have the specific graph, we cannot provide the exact edges that are included in the perfect matching. However, we can discuss the possibility of a perfect matching in a graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges.\n\nA graph with 8 vertices can have a perfect matching, as there is an even number of vertices. A perfect matching consists of disjoint pairs of vertices connected by edges, so in this case, there would be 4 pairs (8 vertices / 2).\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific structure of the graph, we cannot definitively say whether this particular graph with 8 vertices and 12 edges has a perfect matching or not. If you provide the specific graph, we can analyze it and determine if there is a perfect matching and list the edges included in the matching."
