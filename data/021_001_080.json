    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into a triangular form, and then use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n| 3  2  1 | 12 |\n| 2 -1  3 |  7 |\n| 1 -3  2 |  8 |\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nDivide the first row by 3 and use it to eliminate x from the second and third rows:\n\n| 1  2/3  1/3 |  4  |\n| 0 -5/3  7/3 | -1  |\n| 0 -5/3  5/3 |  4  |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nMultiply the second row by -1 and add it to the third row:\n\n| 1  2/3  1/3 |  4  |\n| 0 -5/3  7/3 | -1  |\n| 0    0    2 |  3  |\n\nNow we have a triangular matrix, and we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 3: Back-substitution\n\nFrom the third row, we have: 2z = 3, so z = 3/2.\n\nFrom the second row, we have: -5/3y + 7/3(3/2) = -1. Solving for y, we get y = -1.\n\nFrom the first row, we have: x + 2/3(-1) + 1/3(3/2) = 4. Solving for x, we get x = 3.\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3, y = -1, and z = 3/2."
