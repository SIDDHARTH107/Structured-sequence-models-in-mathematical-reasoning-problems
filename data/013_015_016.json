    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem related to Principal-Agent Problem:\n\nSuppose a principal hires an agent to perform a task. The agent has an opportunity to shirk, and the principal can monitor the agent's effort level with a cost. Specifically, the agent can either shirk or put in high effort, and the principal can observe the agent's effort level by incurring a monitoring cost of $C=100$. The agent's utility is given by U = (e - s)^2, where e is the outcome of the task if the agent exerts high effort, and s is the outcome if the agent shirks. The outcomes are given by e = 100 and s = 50. The probability of a successful outcome is p = 0.7 if the agent exerts high effort, and q = 0.4 if the agent shirks.\n\nWhat effort level will the agent choose if the principal sets an incentive contract that gives the agent a one-time bonus of $300 if the agent exerts high effort? What will be the principal's expected profit?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the agent's utility for each effort level:\n\n1. If the agent exerts high effort:\nUtility = (e - s)^2 = (100 - 50)^2 = 50^2 = 2500\nThe agent will also receive a bonus of $300, so the total utility will be 2500 + 300 = 2800.\n\n2. If the agent shirks:\nUtility = (e - s)^2 = (50 - 50)^2 = 0\n\nSince the utility of exerting high effort (2800) is greater than the utility of shirking (0), the agent will choose to exert high effort.\n\nNow let's calculate the principal's expected profit:\n\n1. If the agent exerts high effort:\nThe probability of a successful outcome is p = 0.7. The principal's profit will be the outcome (e = 100) minus the bonus paid to the agent ($300). So, the expected profit is 0.7 * (100 - 300) = 0.7 * (-200) = -140.\n\n2. If the agent shirks:\nThe probability of a successful outcome is q = 0.4. The principal's profit will be the outcome (s = 50). So, the expected profit is 0.4 * 50 = 20.\n\nHowever, since the agent chooses to exert high effort, the principal's expected profit will be -140. Note that this does not take into account the monitoring cost, as the principal does not need to monitor the agent's effort level due to the incentive contract."
