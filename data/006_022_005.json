    "message_2": "To find the probability, we need to divide the number of students with a GPA of 3.5 or higher by the total number of students in the school.\n\nProbability = (Number of students with GPA 3.5 or higher) / (Total number of students)\n\nProbability = 280 / 800\n\nProbability = 0.35\n\nSo, the probability that a student chosen at random from the school will have a GPA of 3.5 or higher is 0.35 or 35%."
