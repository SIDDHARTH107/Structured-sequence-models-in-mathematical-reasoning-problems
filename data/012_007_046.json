Each edge has a capacity as indicated in the figure. Find the maximum flow from node A to node D. \n\nImage: \n```\n      3\n A --------- B\n |\\         /|\n4| \\     /   |1\n |   \\ /     |\n |     X     |\n |   /   \\   |\n1| /       \\ |2\n |/         \\|\n C --------- D\n      2\n```\n\"",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow from node A to node D, we can use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. We will start by finding augmenting paths and updating the residual capacities of the edges until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\n1. First, we find an augmenting path: A -> B -> D. The bottleneck capacity is the minimum capacity along this path, which is 3. We update the residual capacities of the edges involved and the flow:\n\n```\n      0\n A --------- B\n |\\         /|\n4| \\     /   |4\n |   \\ /     |\n |     X     |\n |   /   \\   |\n1| /       \\ |2\n |/         \\|\n C --------- D\n      2\n```\nFlow: 3\n\n2. Next, we find another augmenting path: A -> C -> D. The bottleneck capacity is 1. We update the residual capacities of the edges involved and the flow:\n\n```\n      0\n A --------- B\n |\\         /|\n3| \\     /   |4\n |   \\ /     |\n |     X     |\n |   /   \\   |\n0| /       \\ |3\n |/         \\|\n C --------- D\n      3\n```\nFlow: 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3. We find another augmenting path: A -> C -> B -> D. The bottleneck capacity is 1. We update the residual capacities of the edges involved and the flow:\n\n```\n      1\n A --------- B\n |\\         /|\n2| \\     /   |3\n |   \\ /     |\n |     X     |\n |   /   \\   |\n1| /       \\ |2\n |/         \\|\n C --------- D\n      2\n```\nFlow: 4 + 1 = 5\n\n4. At this point, we cannot find any more augmenting paths from node A to node D. Therefore, the maximum flow from node A to node D is 5."
