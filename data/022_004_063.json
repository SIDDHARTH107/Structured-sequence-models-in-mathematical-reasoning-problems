    "message_2": "To find the order of the singularity at z=0 for the complex function f(z) = sin(z)/z^5, we can use the power series expansion of sin(z) and then divide by z^5.\n\nThe power series expansion of sin(z) is given by:\n\nsin(z) = z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - (z^7)/7! + ...\n\nNow, we can divide this series by z^5:\n\nf(z) = (sin(z))/z^5 = (z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - (z^7)/7! + ...)/z^5\n\nf(z) = 1/z^4 - 1/(3!z^2) + 1/(5!) - (z^2)/7! + ...\n\nThe function f(z) has a pole of order 4 at z=0, since the first non-zero term in the series is 1/z^4. Therefore, the order of the singularity at z=0 for the complex function f(z) = sin(z)/z^5 is 4."
