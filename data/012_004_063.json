    "message_2": "To find the minimum weight spanning tree for this graph, we can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. I will use Kruskal's algorithm here.\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n   (1, 2) - 1\n   (2, 3) - 2\n   (3, 4) - 2\n   (1, 4) - 3\n   (2, 4) - 4\n   (1, 3) - 5\n\n2. Start adding edges to the minimum weight spanning tree in the sorted order, ensuring that adding an edge does not form a cycle.\n\n- Add edge (1, 2) with weight 1.\n- Add edge (2, 3) with weight 2.\n- Add edge (3, 4) with weight 2. At this point, all vertices are included in the tree, and adding any more edges would create a cycle.\n\nThe minimum weight spanning tree for this graph is:\n\n```\n(1, 2) - 1\n(2, 3) - 2\n(3, 4) - 2\n```\n\nThe total weight of the minimum weight spanning tree is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5."
