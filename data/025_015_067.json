    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface S at point P(2, -1, 1), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nLet F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 3x - 4y - 5z + 7.\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives of F with respect to x, y, and z:\n\n∂F/∂x = 2x - 3\n∂F/∂y = 2y - 4\n∂F/∂z = 2z - 5\n\nNext, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point P(2, -1, 1):\n\n∂F/∂x(P) = 2(2) - 3 = 1\n∂F/∂y(P) = 2(-1) - 4 = -6\n∂F/∂z(P) = 2(1) - 5 = -3\n\nThe gradient of F at point P is given by the vector (1, -6, -3). This vector is normal to the tangent plane at P. Therefore, the equation of the tangent plane can be written as:\n\n1(x - 2) - 6(y + 1) - 3(z - 1) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx - 6y - 3z + 11 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent plane to the surface S at the point P(2, -1, 1) is x - 6y - 3z + 11 = 0."
