    "message_1": "On a certain road, the probability of a car accident occurring is 0.25. If 100 cars travel on the road in a day, what is the probability that at least 1 car will be involved in an accident?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 1 car being involved in an accident, we can first find the probability of no cars being involved in an accident and then subtract that value from 1.\n\nThe probability of a car not being involved in an accident is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.\n\nFor 100 cars, the probability of no cars being involved in an accident is (0.75)^100.\n\nNow, we'll find the probability of at least 1 car being involved in an accident:\n\nP(at least 1 accident) = 1 - P(no accidents)\nP(at least 1 accident) = 1 - (0.75)^100\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(at least 1 accident) = 1 - (0.75)^100 ≈ 1 - 1.928749847963918e-10 ≈ 0.999999999807125\n\nSo, the probability that at least 1 car will be involved in an accident is approximately 0.999999999807125 or 99.9999999807125%."
