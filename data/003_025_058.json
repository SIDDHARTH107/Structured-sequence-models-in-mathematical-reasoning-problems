    "message_2": "To calculate the magnitude and direction of the airplane's velocity vector, we can break down the velocity into its north and east components. The north component will be the vertical component, and the east component will be the horizontal component.\n\nUsing the given direction of N30°E, we can find the north and east components of the velocity vector using trigonometry.\n\nNorth component (vertical) = 200 km/h * sin(30°)\nEast component (horizontal) = 200 km/h * cos(30°)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n30° * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow we can calculate the north and east components:\nNorth component = 200 km/h * sin(π/6) ≈ 100 km/h\nEast component = 200 km/h * cos(π/6) ≈ 173.21 km/h\n\nNow that we have the north and east components, we can find the magnitude of the velocity vector using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nMagnitude = √(North component² + East component²)\nMagnitude = √(100² + 173.21²) ≈ 200 km/h\n\nThe magnitude of the airplane's velocity vector is 200 km/h.\n\nTo find the direction, we can use the arctangent function (tan^(-1)):\n\nDirection = tan^(-1)(North component / East component)\nDirection = tan^(-1)(100 / 173.21)\n\nConverting the result back to degrees:\nDirection ≈ 30°\n\nSince the airplane is traveling in the direction of N30°E, the direction of the airplane's velocity vector is also N30°E.\n\nSo, the magnitude and direction of the airplane's velocity vector are 200 km/h and N30°E, respectively."
