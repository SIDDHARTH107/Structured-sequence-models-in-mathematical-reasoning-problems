    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the length of the base of an isosceles triangle with a height of 8 cm and a perimeter of 28 cm. What is the length of the base?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the base as b and the length of each of the two equal sides as a. Since it's an isosceles triangle, the perimeter can be expressed as:\n\nP = a + a + b = 2a + b\n\nWe're given the perimeter P = 28 cm, so:\n\n28 = 2a + b\n\nNow, let's use the height to find the relationship between a and b. Since the height bisects the base, it creates two right triangles with the height (h) as one leg and half of the base (b/2) as the other leg. The hypotenuse of these right triangles is the equal side a of the isosceles triangle.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\na^2 = h^2 + (b/2)^2\n\nWe're given the height h = 8 cm, so:\n\na^2 = 8^2 + (b/2)^2\na^2 = 64 + b^2/4\n\nNow, let's express a in terms of b using the perimeter equation:\n\nb = 28 - 2a\na = (28 - b)/2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for a in the Pythagorean equation:\n\n((28 - b)/2)^2 = 64 + b^2/4\n\nExpand and simplify the equation:\n\n(784 - 56b + b^2)/4 = 64 + b^2/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n784 - 56b + b^2 = 256 + b^2\n\nNow, subtract b^2 from both sides and simplify:\n\n784 - 56b = 256\n-56b = -528\nb = 528/56\nb = 9.42857142857 cm\n\nSo, the length of the base of the isosceles triangle is approximately 9.43 cm."
