    "message_2": "First, let's create the key matrix using the keyword 'CRYPTOLOGY'. We will remove any duplicate letters from the keyword and fill the remaining spaces in the 5x5 matrix with the rest of the alphabet (excluding 'J', which is usually combined with 'I' in the Playfair cipher).\n\nKeyword: CRYPTOLOGY\nRemove duplicates: CRYPTOLOG\nRemaining alphabet: ABDEFGHIKMNQSUWZ\n\nKey matrix:\nC R Y P T\nO L G A B\nD E F H I\nK M N Q S\nU W Z X V\n\nNow, let's encrypt the message 'MATHS IS FUN'. First, we need to split the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If there's a double letter, we insert an 'X' between them. If the message has an odd number of letters, we add an 'X' at the end.\n\nMATHS IS FUN -> MA TH SI SF UN\n\nNow, we will encrypt each digraph using the key matrix:\n1. Find the row and column of each letter in the digraph.\n2. If the letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their right (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters below them (wrapping around if necessary).\n4. If the letters form a rectangle, replace them with the letters in the same row but at the other corners of the rectangle.\n\nMA -> (1,1)(3,5) -> (1,5)(3,1) -> CT\nTH -> (3,4)(1,2) -> (3,2)(1,4) -> HE\nSI -> (2,2)(4,5) -> (2,5)(4,2) -> SN\nSF -> (2,3)(4,3) -> (2,4)(4,4) -> LN\nUN -> (5,3)(4,4) -> (5,4)(4,3) -> XN\n\nThe encrypted message is: CT HESN LN XN"
