    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible length of cable required to connect all 7 cities, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. This algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree for a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges.\n\n1. Sort all the edges (distances between cities) in non-decreasing order of their weight.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the next edge with the smallest weight, making sure it doesn't form a cycle with the edges already in the minimum spanning tree.\n4. Repeat step 3 until there are 6 edges in the minimum spanning tree (since there are 7 cities, we need 7-1=6 edges to connect them all).\n\nSorted edges:\n10(A-B), 10(E-F), 15(B-E), 15(C-F), 15(F-G), 15(A-D), 20(A-C), 20(B-F), 20(C-G), 20(E-G), 25(B-C), 25(D-F), 30(B-G), 30(D-G), 30(A-E), 35(C-E), 40(D-E)\n\nBuilding the minimum spanning tree:\n1. Add edge 10(A-B)\n2. Add edge 10(E-F)\n3. Add edge 15(B-E)\n4. Add edge 15(C-F)\n5. Add edge 15(F-G) (A-D would form a cycle with A-B and B-E)\n6. Add edge 20(A-C) (B-F would form a cycle with B-E and E-F)\n\nMinimum spanning tree edges: 10(A-B), 10(E-F), 15(B-E), 15(C-F), 15(F-G), 20(A-C)\n\nThe shortest possible length of cable required to connect all 7 cities is the sum of the edge weights in the minimum spanning tree: 10 + 10 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 20 = 85 kilometers."
