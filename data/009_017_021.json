    "message_2": "To calculate the magnetic field strength inside the solenoid, we can use Ampere's law, which is one of Maxwell's equations. Ampere's law states that the line integral of the magnetic field (B) around a closed loop is equal to the product of the permeability of free space (μ₀) and the total current enclosed by the loop.\n\nFor a long solenoid, the magnetic field is uniform and parallel to the axis of the solenoid. Therefore, we can simplify Ampere's law as follows:\n\nB * 2πr = μ₀ * n * I\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, r is the radius of the solenoid, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current flowing through the solenoid.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nn = 1000 turns/m\nr = 0.02 m\nI = 5 A\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the simplified Ampere's law equation:\n\nB * 2π(0.02) = (4π × 10^(-7)) * 1000 * 5\n\nB * 0.04π = 20π × 10^(-7)\n\nNow, we can solve for B:\n\nB = (20π × 10^(-7)) / 0.04π\n\nB ≈ 0.5 T\n\nSo, the magnetic field strength inside the solenoid is approximately 0.5 Tesla."
