    "message_2": "To determine whether $f$ is continuous at $x=1$, we need to show that for any open set $V$ in the topology $\\tau$ containing $f(1)=\\frac{1}{2}$, there exists an open set $U$ in the topology $\\tau$ containing $1$ such that $f(U) \\subseteq V$.\n\nLet $V$ be an open set in the topology $\\tau$ containing $\\frac{1}{2}$. Since the complement of $V$ is either finite or all of $X$, there are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: The complement of $V$ is finite.\nIn this case, there exists a positive real number $\\epsilon$ such that $(\\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon, \\frac{1}{2}+\\epsilon) \\subseteq V$. Let $U = (1-\\epsilon, 1]$. Then, $U$ is an open set in the topology $\\tau$ containing $1$, and for any $x \\in U$, we have $\\frac{1}{2}x \\in (\\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon, \\frac{1}{2}+\\epsilon) \\subseteq V$. Therefore, $f(U) \\subseteq V$.\n\nCase 2: The complement of $V$ is all of $X$.\nIn this case, $V = X$. Let $U = X$. Then, $U$ is an open set in the topology $\\tau$ containing $1$, and $f(U) = f(X) \\subseteq V$.\n\nIn both cases, we have found an open set $U$ in the topology $\\tau$ containing $1$ such that $f(U) \\subseteq V$. Therefore, $f$ is continuous at $x=1$."
