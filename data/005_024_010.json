    "message_2": "To find the percentage of employees earning between $30,000 and $70,000, we can use the empirical rule, which states that for a normal distribution:\n\n- Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.\n- Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean.\n- Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\nIn this case, the mean salary is $50,000 and the standard deviation is $10,000. \n\n$30,000 is two standard deviations below the mean ($50,000 - 2 * $10,000), and $70,000 is two standard deviations above the mean ($50,000 + 2 * $10,000). \n\nSince the range of $30,000 to $70,000 covers two standard deviations below and above the mean, approximately 95% of employees earn between $30,000 and $70,000 according to the empirical rule."
