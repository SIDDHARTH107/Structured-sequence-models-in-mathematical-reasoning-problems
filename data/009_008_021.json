    "message_2": "To solve the given wave equation with the initial conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nSubstitute this into the wave equation:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial t^2} = 4\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2} \\Rightarrow X(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = 4\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $T''(t) + k^2T(t) = 0$\n\n2) $X''(x) + \\frac{k^2}{4}X(x) = 0$\n\nSolve the second equation for $X(x)$:\n\n$X''(x) + \\frac{k^2}{4}X(x) = 0$\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency $\\frac{k}{2}$. The general solution is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\frac{k}{2}x) + B\\sin(\\frac{k}{2}x)$\n\nNow, apply the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(\\pi,t) = 0$:\n\n$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$\n\n$X(\\pi) = B\\sin(\\frac{k}{2}\\pi) = 0$\n\nSince $B$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have:\n\n$\\frac{k}{2}\\pi = n\\pi$ for $n = 1,2,3,...$\n\nThus, $k = 2n$ and the solution for $X(x)$ becomes:\n\n$X_n(x) = B_n\\sin(nx)$\n\nNow, solve the first equation for $T(t)$:\n\n$T''(t) + k^2T(t) = 0$\n\nThis is also a simple harmonic oscillator equation with angular frequency $k$. The general solution is:\n\n$T_n(t) = C_n\\cos(2nt) + D_n\\sin(2nt)$\n\nNow, the general solution for the wave equation is a sum of the product of these solutions:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} X_n(x)T_n(t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n\\sin(nx)(C_n\\cos(2nt) + D_n\\sin(2nt))$\n\nApply the initial conditions:\n\n1) $u(x,0) = \\sin(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n\\sin(nx)C_n$\n\n2) $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = \\cos(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2nB_n\\sin(nx)D_n$\n\nTo find the coefficients $B_n$, $C_n$, and $D_n$, we can use the orthogonality of the sine functions:\n\n1) $\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(x)\\sin(nx) dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\delta_{1n}$\n\n2) $\\int_0^{\\pi} \\cos(x)\\sin(nx) dx = 0$\n\nUsing these orthogonality relations, we can find the coefficients:\n\n1) $B_1C_1 = 1$ and $B_nC_n = 0$ for $n>1$\n\n2) $2nB_nD_n = 0$ for $n>1$\n\nSince $B_1C_1 = 1$, we can choose $B_1 = 1$ and $C_1 = 1$. For $n>1$, we have $D_n = 0$.\n\nThus, the solution to the wave equation with the given initial conditions is:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sin(x)\\cos(2t)$"
