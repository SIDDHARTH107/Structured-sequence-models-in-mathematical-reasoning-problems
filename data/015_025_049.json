    "message_2": "To find the maximum amplitude of oscillation for the forced van der Pol oscillator, we need to analyze the equation and determine the steady-state solution. The given equation is:\n\n$x'' + \\mu(1-x^2)x' + x = A\\cos(\\omega t)$\n\nwith $A = 0.5$, $\\omega = 1.2$, and $\\mu = 1.5$. The initial conditions are $x_0 = 1$ and $x'_0 = 0$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the steady-state solution, which is the solution that remains after the transient response has decayed. The steady-state solution will be of the form:\n\n$x_s(t) = B\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$\n\nwhere $B$ is the amplitude and $\\phi$ is the phase shift. To find the amplitude $B$, we can use the method of averaging, which involves averaging the equation over one period of the forcing function. This method is particularly useful for weakly nonlinear systems like the van der Pol oscillator.\n\nThe method of averaging involves substituting the steady-state solution into the given equation and averaging the resulting equation over one period of the forcing function. This will give us an equation for the amplitude $B$. \n\nAfter applying the method of averaging and solving for $B$, we obtain:\n\n$B = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{(1 - \\omega^2)^2 + (2\\mu\\omega)^2}}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values of $A$, $\\omega$, and $\\mu$:\n\n$B = \\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{(1 - 1.2^2)^2 + (2(1.5)(1.2))^2}}$\n\n$B = \\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{(-0.44)^2 + (3.6)^2}}$\n\n$B = \\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{0.1936 + 12.96}}$\n\n$B = \\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{13.1536}}$\n\n$B \\approx 0.138$\n\nSo, the maximum amplitude of oscillation for the forced van der Pol oscillator is approximately $0.138$."
