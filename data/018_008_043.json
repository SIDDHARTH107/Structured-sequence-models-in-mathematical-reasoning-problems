    "message_2": "The Cartesian product A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. Similarly, the Cartesian product B x A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nAs we can see, the ordered pairs in A x B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B x A. For example, (1, 3) is in A x B but not in B x A, and (3, 1) is in B x A but not in A x B. Therefore, A x B â‰  B x A, which proves that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
