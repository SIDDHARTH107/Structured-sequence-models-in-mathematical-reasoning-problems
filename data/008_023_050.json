    "message_2": "To solve the noisy system of linear equations, we can use the matrix form AX = B and then apply the inverse matrix method to find the solution X. \n\nFirst, let's represent the noisy system in matrix form:\n\nA = | 3.1  3.9 -2.3 |\n    | 2.2 -2.8  1.1 |\n    |-3.9  2.1  2.8 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 11.8 |\n    | -8.3 |\n    | 10.2 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, which we'll call A_inv. We can use a calculator or software to find the inverse of A:\n\nA_inv = |  0.184 -0.231  0.253 |\n        |  0.317  0.079 -0.212 |\n        |  0.558  0.372  0.098 |\n\nNow, we can multiply A_inv by B to find the solution X:\n\nX = A_inv * B\n\nX = |  0.184 -0.231  0.253 |   | 11.8 |   |  x  |\n    |  0.317  0.079 -0.212 | * | -8.3 | = |  y  |\n    |  0.558  0.372  0.098 |   | 10.2 |   |  z  |\n\nMultiplying the matrices, we get:\n\nX = |  1.99  |\n    | -1.98  |\n    |  3.01  |\n\nSo, the solution for the noisy system, rounded to the nearest hundredth, is:\n\nx ≈ 1.99\ny ≈ -1.98\nz ≈ 3.01"
