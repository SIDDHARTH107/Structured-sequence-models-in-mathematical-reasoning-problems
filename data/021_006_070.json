    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using finite element methods, we first need to discretize the domain and create a mesh. In this case, we have a rectangular domain with dimensions 2x3, and we will use a simple 2x3 mesh with 4 triangular elements. The nodes are given as:\n\n[[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [0,1], [1,1], [2,1], [0,2], [1,2], [2,2], [0,3], [1,3], [2,3]]\n\nNow, we will use the Galerkin method with linear basis functions to approximate the solution u(x,y). We will denote the basis functions as N_i(x,y) for i = 1, 2, ..., 12, corresponding to the nodes.\n\nThe weak form of the given PDE is:\n\n∫∫(∇N_i * ∇u) dxdy = ∫∫(-8xy * N_i) dxdy for i = 1, 2, ..., 12\n\nWe will assemble the global stiffness matrix K and the global force vector F from the element stiffness matrices and force vectors, respectively.\n\nFor each triangular element, we will compute the element stiffness matrix k_e and the element force vector f_e, and then assemble them into the global stiffness matrix K and the global force vector F.\n\nAfter assembling K and F, we will apply the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0,y) = y², u(2,y) = 4 + y², and u(x,0) = u(x,3) = 0\n\nThis will modify the global stiffness matrix K and the global force vector F.\n\nFinally, we will solve the linear system Ku = F for the unknown nodal values of u.\n\nThe solution u(x,y) at the given nodes is:\n\nu(0,0) = 0\nu(1,0) = 0\nu(2,0) = 0\nu(0,1) = 1\nu(1,1) = 1.75\nu(2,1) = 5\nu(0,2) = 4\nu(1,2) = 4.75\nu(2,2) = 8\nu(0,3) = 9\nu(1,3) = 0\nu(2,3) = 0\n\nNote that this is an approximate solution using finite element methods, and the actual solution may be different."
