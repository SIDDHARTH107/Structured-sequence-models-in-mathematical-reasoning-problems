    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for the math student to solve related to the chaotic behavior of the double pendulum:\n\nSuppose a double pendulum is made up of two identical point masses m connected by two massless, rigid rods of length L. The pendulum is initially released from rest at an angle of 30 degrees with respect to the vertical. Use numerical methods to find the initial angular velocity of the first mass such that the pendulum completes exactly 5 full revolutions before coming to rest. Assume that the motion of the pendulum is subject to non-linear damping forces. Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the equations of motion for the double pendulum and include the non-linear damping forces. The equations of motion for a double pendulum without damping can be derived using the Lagrangian method, which results in a set of coupled non-linear differential equations. Let's denote the angles of the two rods with respect to the vertical as θ1 and θ2, and their angular velocities as ω1 and ω2.\n\nNow, we need to include the non-linear damping forces. Let's assume that the damping forces are proportional to the square of the angular velocities, with a damping constant k. The modified equations of motion will be:\n\ndω1/dt = - (g/L) * (2 * sin(θ1) - sin(θ2) * cos(θ1 - θ2)) - k * ω1^2 * sign(ω1) - (ω2^2 * sin(θ1 - θ2))\ndω2/dt = - (g/L) * (sin(θ1) * cos(θ1 - θ2) - 2 * sin(θ2)) - k * ω2^2 * sign(ω2) + (ω1^2 * sin(θ1 - θ2))\n\ndθ1/dt = ω1\ndθ2/dt = ω2\n\nTo find the initial angular velocity ω1(0) such that the pendulum completes exactly 5 full revolutions before coming to rest, we need to solve this system of differential equations numerically. We can use a numerical method like the Runge-Kutta method to integrate the equations of motion.\n\nHowever, the problem is not well-defined, as the value of the damping constant k is not given. The initial angular velocity required to complete 5 full revolutions will depend on the value of k. If you provide a value for the damping constant, we can proceed with the numerical integration and find the initial angular velocity."
