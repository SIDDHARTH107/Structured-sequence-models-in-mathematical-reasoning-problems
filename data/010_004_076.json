    "message_2": "To prove that this set is not compact, we will show that it does not satisfy the Heine-Borel theorem, which states that a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.\n\nLet's consider the set F of all real-valued functions defined on the closed interval [0, 1] with the norm defined as the maximum value of f(x) over x in [0, 1]. We will show that F is not bounded.\n\nConsider the sequence of functions {f_n(x)} defined by f_n(x) = nx for x in [0, 1] and n a positive integer. For each n, f_n is a real-valued function defined on [0, 1]. Now, let's compute the norm of each f_n:\n\n||f_n|| = max{f_n(x) : x in [0, 1]} = max{nx : x in [0, 1]} = n.\n\nSince n can be arbitrarily large, the norms of the functions in the sequence {f_n} are unbounded. Therefore, the set F is not bounded.\n\nSince F is not bounded, it cannot be compact according to the Heine-Borel theorem. Thus, the set of all real-valued functions defined on the closed interval [0, 1] with the given norm is not compact."
