    "message_2": "To find a harmonic function that satisfies the given conditions, we can use the method of conformal mapping. We will map the square to the unit disk and then find a harmonic function on the disk that satisfies the given boundary conditions.\n\nFirst, let's find a conformal mapping from the square to the unit disk. One such mapping is given by the Schwarz-Christoffel formula:\n\n$$f(z) = \\int \\frac{dz}{(z-a)^{1/4}(z-b)^{1/4}(z-c)^{1/4}(z-d)^{1/4}}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d$ are the vertices of the square. In our case, $a = 0, b = 1, c = 1+i, d = i$. The integral can be computed numerically, and we obtain the mapping:\n\n$$f(z) = K\\int_0^z \\frac{dt}{(t(t-1)(t-i))^{\\frac{1}{4}}}$$\n\nwhere $K$ is a constant chosen such that $f(1+i) = 1$. Now, let's find a harmonic function on the unit disk. One such function is given by the Poisson integral formula:\n\n$$u(r,\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\\cos(\\theta-\\phi)+r^2}u(1,\\phi) d\\phi$$\n\nwhere $(r,\\theta)$ are the polar coordinates in the unit disk. We need to find $u(1,\\phi)$ such that it corresponds to the boundary condition $u(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$ on the square. To do this, we can use the inverse of the conformal mapping $f^{-1}(z)$:\n\n$$u(1,\\phi) = u(f^{-1}(e^{i\\phi})) = (x^2 - y^2)(f^{-1}(e^{i\\phi}))$$\n\nNow, we can plug this into the Poisson integral formula and obtain the desired harmonic function on the unit disk:\n\n$$u(r,\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\\cos(\\theta-\\phi)+r^2}(x^2 - y^2)(f^{-1}(e^{i\\phi})) d\\phi$$\n\nFinally, we can map this harmonic function back to the square using the conformal mapping $f(z)$:\n\n$$u(x,y) = u(f(z)) = u(r,\\theta)$$\n\nThis harmonic function satisfies the given boundary conditions and decays to zero as $|(x,y)| \\to \\infty$."
