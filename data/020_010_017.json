    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The profits per unit for product A and B are $4 and $6 respectively. Due to uncertainties in the market, the demand for each product could vary by up to 20%. The factory wants to determine the optimal production quantity for each product to maximize their profit, taking into account this uncertainty.\n\nWrite a robust optimization problem for the factory to solve. Given that the factory can produce no more than 100 units of each product, what is the optimal production quantity of each product that maximizes the expected profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nObjective: Maximize profit P = 4x + 6y\n\nConstraints:\n1. 0 ≤ x ≤ 100\n2. 0 ≤ y ≤ 100\n3. x + y ≤ 100 (total production capacity)\n\nTo account for the uncertainty in demand, we will consider the worst-case scenario for each product, which is a 20% decrease in demand. Let dA and dB be the demand for product A and product B, respectively.\n\nWorst-case demand:\ndA = 0.8x\ndB = 0.8y\n\nNow, we need to maximize the profit in the worst-case scenario.\n\nObjective: Maximize worst-case profit P_wc = 4(0.8x) + 6(0.8y) = 3.2x + 4.8y\n\nConstraints:\n1. 0 ≤ x ≤ 100\n2. 0 ≤ y ≤ 100\n3. x + y ≤ 100\n\nNow, we can solve the linear programming problem.\n\nObjective: Maximize P_wc = 3.2x + 4.8y\n\nConstraints:\n1. 0 ≤ x ≤ 100\n2. 0 ≤ y ≤ 100\n3. x + y ≤ 100\n\nUsing the graphical method or a linear programming solver, we find the optimal solution to be:\n\nx = 0 (units of product A)\ny = 100 (units of product B)\n\nThus, the factory should produce 0 units of product A and 100 units of product B to maximize their expected profit in the worst-case scenario. The maximum expected profit in the worst-case scenario is P_wc = 3.2(0) + 4.8(100) = $480."
