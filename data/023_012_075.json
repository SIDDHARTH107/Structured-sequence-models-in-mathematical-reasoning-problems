    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is odd, we know that all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe function f(x) is defined as:\nf(x) = x^2, for -π < x < 0\nf(x) = -x^2, for 0 < x < π\n\nThe Fourier series of an odd function is given by:\nf(x) = ∑[b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nTo find the b_n coefficients, we use the following formula:\nb_n = (2 / π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x) dx] from -π to π\n\nSince the function is defined differently for -π < x < 0 and 0 < x < π, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [∫(x^2 * sin(n * x) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(-x^2 * sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nNow, we need to solve these integrals:\n\n∫(x^2 * sin(n * x) dx) from -π to 0 = (x^2 * (-cos(n * x) / n) - (2 * x * sin(n * x) / n^2) - (2 * cos(n * x) / n^3)) from -π to 0\n\n∫(-x^2 * sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π = (-x^2 * (-cos(n * x) / n) + (2 * x * sin(n * x) / n^2) + (2 * cos(n * x) / n^3)) from 0 to π\n\nNow, we can plug in the limits of integration and simplify:\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(0 - (-π)^2 * (-cos(0)) / n) - (2 * (-π) * sin(0) / n^2) - (2 * cos(0) / n^3) + (π^2 * (-cos(n * π)) / n) - (2 * π * sin(n * π) / n^2) - (2 * cos(n * π) / n^3)]\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(-π^2 / n) + (2 / n^3) + (π^2 * cos(n * π) / n) - (2 * cos(n * π) / n^3)]\n\nb_n = (2 / π) * [(π^2 * (1 - cos(n * π)) / n) - (2 * (1 - cos(n * π)) / n^3)]\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for the given function:\n\nf(x) = ∑[((2 * π^2 * (1 - cos(n * π)) / (n * π)) - (4 * (1 - cos(n * π)) / (n^3 * π))] * sin(n * x)\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given function f(x) = x^2 for -π < x < 0 and f(x) = -x^2 for 0 < x < π."
