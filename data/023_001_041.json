    "message_2": "The Fourier Series representation of a periodic function f(t) with period 2π is given by:\n\nf(t) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * t) + b_n * sin(n * t)]\n\nwhere the coefficients a_0, a_n, and b_n are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(t) * dt] from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(t) * cos(n * t) * dt] from -π to π\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(t) * sin(n * t) * dt] from -π to π\n\nIn this case, f(t) = 5, which is a constant function. Let's find the coefficients:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[5 * dt] from -π to π\na_0 = (5/π) * [t] from -π to π\na_0 = (5/π) * (π - (-π))\na_0 = 5\n\nSince f(t) is an even function (symmetric about the y-axis), all the b_n coefficients will be zero. Now, let's find the a_n coefficients:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[5 * cos(n * t) * dt] from -π to π\n\nIntegrating with respect to t, we get:\n\na_n = (5/nπ) * [sin(n * t)] from -π to π\n\nSince sin(n * π) = sin(-n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, the a_n coefficients will also be zero for n ≥ 1.\n\nSo, the Fourier Series representation of f(t) = 5 with period 2π is:\n\nf(t) = 5\n\nThis result makes sense, as the constant function f(t) = 5 is already periodic with period 2π, and its Fourier Series representation should be the same as the original function."
