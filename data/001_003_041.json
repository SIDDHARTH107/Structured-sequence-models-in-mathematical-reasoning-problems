    "message_2": "First, we will solve one of the equations for one of the variables. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n\n2x = 7 - 3y\n\nx = (7 - 3y) / 2\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n5x - 4y = -23\n\n5((7 - 3y) / 2) - 4y = -23\n\nNow, we will solve for y:\n\n(35 - 15y) / 2 - 4y = -23\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n35 - 15y - 8y = -46\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-23y = -81\n\nNow, divide by -23:\n\ny = 81 / 23\n\ny = 3\n\nNow that we have the value for y, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = (7 - 3y) / 2\n\nx = (7 - 3(3)) / 2\n\nx = (7 - 9) / 2\n\nx = -2 / 2\n\nx = -1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -1 and y = 3."
