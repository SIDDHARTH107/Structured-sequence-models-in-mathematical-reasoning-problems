    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^2 / x, we can first simplify the function before applying the quotient rule. Since f(x) = 5x^2 / x, we can simplify it to f(x) = 5x (by canceling out one x from the numerator and the denominator).\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of the simplified function f(x) = 5x. The derivative of a function, f'(x), is found by applying the power rule, which states that if f(x) = ax^n, then f'(x) = n * ax^(n-1).\n\nIn our case, a = 5 and n = 1. So, applying the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 1 * 5x^(1-1) = 5x^0 = 5(1) = 5\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^2 / x is f'(x) = 5."
