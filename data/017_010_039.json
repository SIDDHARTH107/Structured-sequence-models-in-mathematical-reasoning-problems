    "message_2": "To determine if the group G is isomorphic to C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10, we can analyze the properties of the group G from the given multiplication table.\n\nFirst, let's check if G is abelian. A group is abelian if the multiplication table is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal. In this case, we can see that G is abelian since the table is symmetric. For example, a*c = b and c*a = b, b*f = i and f*b = i, etc.\n\nNow, let's check if G is cyclic. A group is cyclic if there exists an element that generates the whole group by its powers. We can see that no element in G generates the whole group by its powers. For example, the powers of a are {a, e, c, b}, the powers of b are {b, e, j, d}, and so on. Therefore, G is not cyclic.\n\nSince G is abelian but not cyclic, it cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C10.\n\nNow, let's check if G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D5. The dihedral group D5 has 10 elements and is non-abelian. Since G is abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to D5.\n\nFinally, let's consider the non-abelian group of order 10. Since G is abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 10 either.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G is not isomorphic to any of the given groups (C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10)."
