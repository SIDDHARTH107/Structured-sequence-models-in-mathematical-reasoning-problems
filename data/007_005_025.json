    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 24, 36, and 60, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n60 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1\n\n2. For each prime factor, take the highest power that appears in any of the factorizations:\n2^3, 3^2, and 5^1\n\n3. Multiply these highest powers together:\n2^3 * 3^2 * 5^1 = 8 * 9 * 5 = 360\n\nThe LCM of 24, 36, and 60 is 360."
