If a sample of 100 bulbs is taken, what is the probability that the mean lifespan of the sample is between 790 and 810 hours? Use the Central Limit Theorem to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Central Limit Theorem, we first need to find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. \n\nThe mean of the sampling distribution (μx) is equal to the population mean (μ), which is 800 hours.\n\nμx = μ = 800 hours\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution (σx) is equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nσx = σ / √n = 50 / √100 = 50 / 10 = 5 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range (790 and 810 hours) using the formula:\n\nz = (x - μx) / σx\n\nFor the lower limit (790 hours):\n\nz1 = (790 - 800) / 5 = -10 / 5 = -2\n\nFor the upper limit (810 hours):\n\nz2 = (810 - 800) / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean falls between these z-scores. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the area under the curve between these z-scores.\n\nP(-2 < z < 2) = P(z < 2) - P(z < -2) ≈ 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544\n\nSo, there is approximately a 95.44% probability that the mean lifespan of the sample of 100 light bulbs is between 790 and 810 hours."
