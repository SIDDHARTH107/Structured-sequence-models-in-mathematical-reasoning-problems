    "message_2": "1. The set {a,b} is closed in X.\n\nTo determine if {a,b} is closed, we need to check if its complement is open. The complement of {a,b} in X is {c}. Since {c} is not an element of the topology T, its complement {a,b} is not closed. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n2. X is a connected space.\n\nA space is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. In this case, we can represent X as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets: {a,b} and {c}. Since {a,b} and {c} are both open in T and their union is X, the space X is not connected. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n3. The set {c} is open in X.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the set {c} is not an element of the topology T. Therefore, the set {c} is not open in X. This statement is false."
