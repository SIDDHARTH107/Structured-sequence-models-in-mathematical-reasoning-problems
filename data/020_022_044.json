The factory has 4800 labor hours and 3200 machine hours per week available for production. The profit per unit of P1 and P2 is $20 and $30, respectively. The factory wants to determine how many units of P1 and P2 to produce per week to maximize profit. \n\n| Product | Labor hours/unit | Machine hours/unit |\n|---------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| P1      | 3               | 2                  |\n| P2      | 2               | 4                  |\n\nFormulate this as a linear programming problem and solve to find the optimal production quantities and the maximum profit that can be generated weekly.",
    "message_2": "To formulate this problem as a linear programming problem, we need to define the variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\nLet x1 be the number of units of P1 produced per week, and x2 be the number of units of P2 produced per week.\n\nObjective function (to maximize profit):\nProfit = 20x1 + 30x2\n\nConstraints (labor and machine hours):\n3x1 + 2x2 ≤ 4800 (labor hours constraint)\n2x1 + 4x2 ≤ 3200 (machine hours constraint)\nx1 ≥ 0, x2 ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nNow we can solve the linear programming problem using the graphical method or the simplex method. In this case, we will use the graphical method.\n\n1. Graph the constraints on a coordinate plane with x1 on the x-axis and x2 on the y-axis.\n2. Identify the feasible region (the area where all constraints are satisfied).\n3. Find the vertices of the feasible region.\n4. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex to find the maximum profit.\n\nStep 1: Graph the constraints\n3x1 + 2x2 ≤ 4800 => x2 ≤ (4800 - 3x1) / 2\n2x1 + 4x2 ≤ 3200 => x2 ≤ (3200 - 2x1) / 4\n\nStep 2: Identify the feasible region\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is the area enclosed by the x1-axis, x2-axis, the line x2 = (4800 - 3x1) / 2, and the line x2 = (3200 - 2x1) / 4.\n\nStep 3: Find the vertices of the feasible region\nThe vertices are the points where the constraint lines intersect. In this case, there are four vertices: (0, 0), (0, 800), (1600, 0), and (800, 600).\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the objective function at each vertex\n(0, 0): Profit = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n(0, 800): Profit = 20(0) + 30(800) = $24,000\n(1600, 0): Profit = 20(1600) + 30(0) = $32,000\n(800, 600): Profit = 20(800) + 30(600) = $34,000\n\nThe maximum profit of $34,000 is achieved when producing 800 units of P1 and 600 units of P2 per week."
