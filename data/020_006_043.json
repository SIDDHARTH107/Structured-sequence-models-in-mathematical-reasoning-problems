    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, X and Y. The production of X requires 3 units of labor and 2 units of raw material, while the production of Y requires 4 units of labor and 1 unit of raw material. The factory has 50 units of labor and 30 units of raw material available. Each unit of X can be sold for $8, and each unit of Y can be sold for $10. Find the optimal number of units of X and Y that the factory should produce to maximize its profit, if the factory can only produce a whole number of units of X and Y.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced. The constraints for labor and raw materials can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n3x + 4y ≤ 50 (labor constraint)\n2x + y ≤ 30 (raw material constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP(x, y) = 8x + 10y\n\nWe will now find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and finding the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we will find the boundary lines for the constraints:\n\n3x + 4y = 50\ny = (50 - 3x) / 4\n\n2x + y = 30\ny = 30 - 2x\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations:\n\n1) Intersection of labor constraint and raw material constraint:\n3x + 4y = 50\n2x + y = 30\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 10 and y = 10.\n\n2) Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n3x + 4y = 50\n3(0) + 4y = 50\ny = 12.5\n\nSince the factory can only produce whole numbers of units, we will consider y = 12.\n\n3) Intersection of raw material constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n2x + y = 30\n2x + 0 = 30\nx = 15\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each of the vertices:\n\nP(10, 10) = 8(10) + 10(10) = 180\nP(0, 12) = 8(0) + 10(12) = 120\nP(15, 0) = 8(15) + 10(0) = 120\n\nThe maximum profit is $180 when the factory produces 10 units of product X and 10 units of product Y."
