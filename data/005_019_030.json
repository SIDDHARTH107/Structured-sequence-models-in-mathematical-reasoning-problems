    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces three types of products: A, B, and C. The company found that 60% of product A is purchased by customers who also buy product B, 50% of product B is also purchased by customers who buy product C, and 40% of product C is purchased by customers who buy product A. If there are currently 300 customers who bought product A, how many can be expected to buy product B and C in the next purchase?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. 60% of customers who bought product A also buy product B. Since there are 300 customers who bought product A, the number of customers who bought both A and B is:\n\n0.60 * 300 = 180 customers\n\n2. 50% of customers who bought product B also buy product C. We know that 180 customers bought both A and B, so the number of customers who bought B and C is:\n\n0.50 * 180 = 90 customers\n\n3. The problem asks for the number of customers who can be expected to buy products B and C in the next purchase. Since we've already found that 90 customers bought both B and C, the answer is:\n\n90 customers"
