    "message_2": "First, let's simplify the equation by factoring out the common factors in the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 5x^2 - 15x = 5x(x - 3)\nDenominator: 10x - 30 = 10(x - 3)\n\nNow the equation looks like this:\n\n(5x(x - 3)) / (10(x - 3)) = 1/2\n\nSince (x - 3) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n(5x) / (10) = 1/2\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation further by dividing 5x by 10:\n\nx / 2 = 1/2\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution for x is 1."
