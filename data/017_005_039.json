    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. Since 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow Theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup of G, say H, of order 3^3 = 27. Let n_3 denote the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G. By the Sylow Theorems, we have that n_3 divides the order of G and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Since the order of G is 27, the only possibilities for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, which is H. Since H is a subgroup of G and has the same order as G, we have that H = G. Thus, G is a p-group of order 3^3. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_27) or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9 (isomorphic to Z_3 × Z_9).\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Let H_1, H_2, and H_3 be these subgroups. Since the intersection of any two distinct Sylow p-subgroups is trivial, we have that |H_1 ∩ H_2| = 1 for any distinct H_1 and H_2. Now, consider the set H_1H_2 = {h_1h_2 | h_1 ∈ H_1, h_2 ∈ H_2}. Since |H_1| = |H_2| = 27, we have that |H_1H_2| = 27^2 = 729. However, we know that |H_1H_2| divides the order of G, which is 27. This is a contradiction, so there cannot be three Sylow 3-subgroups of G.\n\nThus, we are left with the only possibility that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 9."
