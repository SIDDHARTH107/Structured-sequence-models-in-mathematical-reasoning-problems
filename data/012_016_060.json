    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we first need to determine the Tutte polynomial itself. The graph has 6 vertices and 9 edges. We can represent the graph as a set of its edges: E = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, e8, e9}.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T(G; x, y) of a graph G can be computed recursively using the following rules:\n\n1. If G has no edges, then T(G; x, y) = x^(number of isolated vertices in G).\n2. If G has a loop, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y), where e is the loop edge.\n3. If G has a bridge, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + T(G / e; x, y), where e is the bridge edge.\n4. If G has a non-bridge edge e, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + x * T(G / e; x, y), where G / e is the graph obtained by contracting edge e.\n\nIn this case, the graph has no loops or bridges, so we can apply rule 4. We can choose edge e1 as the non-bridge edge. Then, we have:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - e1; x, y) + x * T(G / e1; x, y)\n\nNow, we need to compute T(G - e1; x, y) and T(G / e1; x, y) for the graph with edge e1 removed and the graph with edge e1 contracted, respectively.\n\nAfter removing edge e1, we get the following graph:\n\n![graph_minus_e1](https://i.imgur.com/6Uz5Y5S.png)\n\nAfter contracting edge e1, we get the following graph:\n\n![graph_contract_e1](https://i.imgur.com/8U6v0c6.png)\n\nNow, we can compute the Tutte polynomials for these two graphs:\n\nT(G - e1; x, y) = (x - 1)(y - 1)^4 + (x - 1)^2(y - 1)^3\nT(G / e1; x, y) = (x - 1)(y - 1)^3 + (x - 1)^2(y - 1)^2\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions back into the original equation:\n\nT(G; x, y) = ((x - 1)(y - 1)^4 + (x - 1)^2(y - 1)^3) + x * ((x - 1)(y - 1)^3 + (x - 1)^2(y - 1)^2)\n\nNow, we can substitute x = 2 and y = 3 into the equation:\n\nT(G; 2, 3) = ((2 - 1)(3 - 1)^4 + (2 - 1)^2(3 - 1)^3) + 2 * ((2 - 1)(3 - 1)^3 + (2 - 1)^2(3 - 1)^2)\nT(G; 2, 3) = (1 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3) + 2 * (1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2)\nT(G; 2, 3) = (16 + 8) + 2 * (8 + 4)\nT(G; 2, 3) = 24 + 2 * 12\nT(G; 2, 3) = 24 + 24\nT(G; 2, 3) = 48\n\nSo, the value of the Tutte polynomial of the given graph when x = 2 and y = 3 is 48."
