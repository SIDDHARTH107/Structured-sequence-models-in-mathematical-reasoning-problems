The carrying capacity of the island is 5000 rabbits and the initial population is 1000 rabbits with a growth rate of 0.4. What will be the predicted population of rabbits after 5 years?",
    "message_2": "To predict the population of rabbits after 5 years using the logistic growth model, we can use the following formula:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + ((K - P0) / P0) * e^(-r * t))\n\nwhere:\nP(t) = population at time t\nK = carrying capacity (5000 rabbits)\nP0 = initial population (1000 rabbits)\nr = growth rate (0.4)\nt = time in years (5 years)\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + ((5000 - 1000) / 1000) * e^(-0.4 * 5))\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + (4) * e^(-2))\n\nNow, calculate the value of e^(-2):\n\ne^(-2) ≈ 0.13534\n\nNow, plug this value back into the equation:\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + 4 * 0.13534)\n\nP(5) = 5000 / (1 + 0.54136)\n\nP(5) = 5000 / 1.54136\n\nFinally, calculate the predicted population:\n\nP(5) ≈ 3242.47\n\nThe predicted population of rabbits after 5 years is approximately 3242 rabbits."
