    "message_1": "A sound wave has the equation y = 2 cos(3x - π/4) where y is the amplitude and x is time in seconds. What is the phase shift of the wave?",
    "message_2": "The general equation for a cosine wave is y = A cos(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift. In the given equation, y = 2 cos(3x - π/4), we can see that it matches the general form with A = 2, B = 3, and C = π/4. There is no vertical shift, as there is no constant term added to the cosine function.\n\nThe phase shift of the wave is C, which in this case is π/4."
