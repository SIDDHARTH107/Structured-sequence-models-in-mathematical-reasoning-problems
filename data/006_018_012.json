    "message_1": "Suppose that in a certain company, the probability of financial fraud occurring in any given year is 0.05. If the company has been operating for 12 years, what is the probability that at least one financial fraud occurred during this period?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring during the 12-year period, we can first find the probability of no financial fraud occurring during this period and then subtract it from 1.\n\nThe probability of no financial fraud occurring in any given year is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor no financial fraud to occur in all 12 years, the probability is (0.95)^12.\n\nNow, to find the probability of at least one financial fraud occurring, we subtract the probability of no financial fraud from 1:\n\nProbability (at least one financial fraud) = 1 - (0.95)^12 â‰ˆ 0.4596\n\nSo, the probability that at least one financial fraud occurred during the 12-year period is approximately 45.96%."
