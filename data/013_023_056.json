    "message_1": "In the Trust Game, consider two players. Player 1 starts with $10 and can choose to keep any amount of money between $0 and $10. Whatever amount Player 1 keeps is then tripled and given to Player 2. Player 2 can then choose to keep any amount of the money given to them or to return any part of it to Player 1. \n\nIf Player 1 keeps $6, how much money would Player 2 need to return to Player 1 in order to end up with a total of $8?",
    "message_2": "If Player 1 keeps $6, then they give $10 - $6 = $4 to Player 2. This amount is tripled, so Player 2 receives $4 * 3 = $12.\n\nPlayer 2 wants to end up with a total of $8. Since they received $12 from Player 1, they need to return $12 - $8 = $4 to Player 1."
