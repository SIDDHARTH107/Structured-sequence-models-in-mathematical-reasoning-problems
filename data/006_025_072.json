    "message_2": "To find the probability that all three tricks will be successful, we need to multiply the probabilities of each trick being successful together.\n\nProbability of all three tricks being successful = (Probability of Trick 1 being successful) × (Probability of Trick 2 being successful) × (Probability of Trick 3 being successful)\n\n= 0.8 × 0.7 × 0.9\n= 0.504\n\nSo, the probability that all three tricks will be successful is 0.504 or 50.4%."
