    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation y'' - 4y = -10sin(2t) with the initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 2 using Fourier transforms, we follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation.\nLet Y(w) be the Fourier transform of y(t), then the Fourier transform of y''(t) is (-jw)^2Y(w) = -w^2Y(w). The Fourier transform of -4y(t) is -4Y(w). The Fourier transform of -10sin(2t) is -10jπ[δ(w - 2) - δ(w + 2)], where δ(w) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nSo, we have:\n-w^2Y(w) - 4Y(w) = -10jπ[δ(w - 2) - δ(w + 2)]\n\nStep 2: Solve for Y(w).\nY(w) = -10jπ[δ(w - 2) - δ(w + 2)] / (-w^2 - 4)\n\nStep 3: Take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(w) to find y(t).\ny(t) = (1/2π) ∫[-10jπ[δ(w - 2) - δ(w + 2)] / (-w^2 - 4)] e^(jwt) dw\n\nNow, we can use the property of the inverse Fourier transform with the Dirac delta function:\ny(t) = -5j[ e^(2jt) - e^(-2jt) ] / 2\n\nStep 4: Apply the initial conditions.\ny(0) = 0 => -5j[1 - 1] / 2 = 0 (satisfied)\ny'(t) = -5j[2je^(2jt) + 2je^(-2jt)] / 2\ny'(0) = 2 => -5j[2j + 2j] / 2 = 2 => -10j = 2 (not satisfied)\n\nThe given initial conditions are inconsistent with the differential equation. Therefore, there is no solution to the problem with the given initial conditions."
