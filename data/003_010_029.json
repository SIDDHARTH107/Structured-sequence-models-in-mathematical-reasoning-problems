    "message_2": "To find the angle of elevation, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. In this case, the opposite side is the height of the building (60 meters) and the adjacent side is the distance you are standing away from the building (25 meters).\n\nLet θ be the angle of elevation. Then, we have:\n\ntan(θ) = (opposite side) / (adjacent side)\ntan(θ) = 60 / 25\ntan(θ) = 2.4\n\nNow, we need to find the angle whose tangent is 2.4. We can use the arctangent (inverse tangent) function to do this:\n\nθ = arctan(2.4)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nθ ≈ 67.38 degrees\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle of elevation is approximately 67 degrees."
