    "message_1": "A ladder is leaning against a wall at an angle of 60 degrees to the ground. The length of the ladder is 10 meters. How far up the wall does the ladder reach?",
    "message_2": "To find how far up the wall the ladder reaches, we can use the sine function in trigonometry. The sine function relates the angle, the length of the hypotenuse (the ladder in this case), and the length of the side opposite the angle (the height up the wall).\n\nsin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse\n\nIn this problem, the angle is 60 degrees, and the hypotenuse (the ladder) is 10 meters long. We want to find the opposite side (the height up the wall).\n\nsin(60) = height / 10\n\nTo find the sine of 60 degrees, we can either use a calculator or recall that sin(60) = √3/2.\n\n(√3/2) = height / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the height:\n\nheight = 10 * (√3/2)\n\nheight = 5√3\n\nTherefore, the ladder reaches approximately 5√3 ≈ 8.66 meters up the wall."
