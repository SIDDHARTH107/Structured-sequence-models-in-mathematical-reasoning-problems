    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B and B x A.\n\nA x B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the two sets (A x B) Δ (B x A). The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n\n(A x B) Δ (B x A) = (A x B ∪ B x A) - (A x B ∩ B x A)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of the two sets:\n\nA x B ∪ B x A = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the two sets:\n\nA x B ∩ B x A = {(2, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference:\n\n(A x B) Δ (B x A) = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's show that the result is not commutative. Commutativity means that the order of the operands does not matter, i.e., A x B = B x A. However, we can see that the sets A x B and B x A are not equal:\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nSince A x B ≠ B x A, the result is not commutative."
