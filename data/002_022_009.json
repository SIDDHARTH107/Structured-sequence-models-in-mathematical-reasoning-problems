    "message_1": "A torus has a minor radius of 5 cm and a major radius of 10 cm. What is the volume of the torus in cubic centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (π * minor_radius²) * (2 * π * major_radius)\n\nIn this case, the minor radius (r) is 5 cm and the major radius (R) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (π * 5²) * (2 * π * 10)\n\nVolume = (π * 25) * (20 * π)\n\nVolume = 500 * π²\n\nThe volume of the torus is approximately 4934.8 cubic centimeters."
