    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first two equations by adding them:\n\n(x - y + z) + (2x + y - z) = 0 + 0\n3x = 0\nx = 0\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into the first two equations to find the values of y and z:\n\n0 - y + z = 0\n-y + z = 0\nz = y\n\n2(0) + y - z = 0\ny - z = 0\ny = z\n\nSince z = y and y = z, we can conclude that y and z can be any value, as long as they are equal. Therefore, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 0\ny = z\n\nThis means that there are infinitely many solutions, as y and z can be any value as long as they are equal."
