    "message_2": "To find the inflection points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1, we need to find the points where the second derivative of the function changes its sign.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (3x^2 - 6x + 2) = 6x - 6\n\nTo find the inflection points, we need to solve the equation f''(x) = 0:\n\n6x - 6 = 0\n6(x - 1) = 0\nx - 1 = 0\nx = 1\n\nSo, there is an inflection point at x = 1. To find the corresponding y-coordinate, we plug the x-value back into the original function f(x):\n\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 3(1)^2 + 2(1) - 1 = 1 - 3 + 2 - 1 = -1\n\nThus, the inflection point of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1 is (1, -1)."
