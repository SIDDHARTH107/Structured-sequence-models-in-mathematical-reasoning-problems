    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 2^50 is divided by 5, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. We know that 2^4 = 16, which is congruent to 1 modulo 5 (since 16 - 1 = 15 is divisible by 5). Therefore, we can write 2^50 as (2^4)^12 * 2^2, which is congruent to 1^12 * 2^2 modulo 5. \n\n1^12 is congruent to 1 modulo 5, and 2^2 is congruent to 4 modulo 5. Thus, 1^12 * 2^2 is congruent to 1 * 4 modulo 5, which is congruent to 4 modulo 5. \n\nSo, the remainder when 2^50 is divided by 5 is 4."
