    "message_1": "A company wants to estimate the probability of winning a contract. Historical data shows that only 20% of the submitted bids were accepted. If the company submits 8 bids, what is the probability that at least 2 of them will be accepted?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least 2 bids being accepted, we can use the binomial probability formula. However, it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event (0 or 1 bid being accepted) and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (bids), k is the number of successes (accepted bids), p is the probability of success (0.20), and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of 0 bids being accepted:\n\nP(X = 0) = (8C0) * (0.20^0) * (0.80^8) = 1 * 1 * 0.16777216 = 0.16777216\n\nNow, let's find the probability of 1 bid being accepted:\n\nP(X = 1) = (8C1) * (0.20^1) * (0.80^7) = 8 * 0.20 * 0.2097152 = 0.33554432\n\nNow, we find the probability of the complementary event (0 or 1 bid being accepted):\n\nP(X = 0 or X = 1) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) = 0.16777216 + 0.33554432 = 0.50331648\n\nFinally, we find the probability of at least 2 bids being accepted by subtracting the complementary probability from 1:\n\nP(X >= 2) = 1 - P(X = 0 or X = 1) = 1 - 0.50331648 = 0.49668352\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 bids will be accepted is approximately 49.67%."
