    "message_2": "The forward difference formula is given by:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nwhere h is the step size, which is 0.1 in this case. We want to approximate the derivative f'(1), so we'll plug in x = 1 and h = 0.1 into the formula:\n\nf'(1) ≈ (f(1 + 0.1) - f(1)) / 0.1\n\nFirst, we need to find the values of f(1) and f(1.1):\n\nf(1) = sin(1) + 1^2 = sin(1) + 1\nf(1.1) = sin(1.1) + (1.1)^2 = sin(1.1) + 1.21\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the forward difference formula:\n\nf'(1) ≈ (sin(1.1) + 1.21 - (sin(1) + 1)) / 0.1\n\nf'(1) ≈ (sin(1.1) - sin(1) + 0.21) / 0.1\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the values of sin(1) and sin(1.1):\n\nsin(1) ≈ 0.8415\nsin(1.1) ≈ 0.8912\n\nPlug these values back into the formula:\n\nf'(1) ≈ (0.8912 - 0.8415 + 0.21) / 0.1\n\nf'(1) ≈ (0.0497 + 0.21) / 0.1\n\nf'(1) ≈ 0.2597 / 0.1\n\nf'(1) ≈ 2.597\n\nSo, using the forward difference formula with a step size of 0.1, the approximate value of the derivative f'(1) is 2.597."
