    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Add x to both sides of the equation to get all the x terms on one side:\n2x + x + 5 = 9 - x + x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n3x + 5 = 9\n\n2. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to isolate the x terms:\n3x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n3x = 4\n\n3. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:\n3x / 3 = 4 / 3\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx = 4/3\n\nSo, the solution is x = 4/3."
