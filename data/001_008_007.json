    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 5 ≤ 17, we need to isolate x. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n   2x + 5 - 5 ≤ 17 - 5\n   2x ≤ 12\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\n   2x / 2 ≤ 12 / 2\n   x ≤ 6\n\nSo, the solution to the inequality is x ≤ 6.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line and label it with numbers, making sure to include 6.\n\n2. Since x is less than or equal to 6, we will use a closed circle at 6 to indicate that 6 is included in the solution.\n\n3. Shade the region to the left of the closed circle, indicating that all values less than 6 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\n<---(----(----(----(----(----[----)----)----)----)----)--->\n    ...  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   ...\n\nWhere the \"[\" represents a closed circle at 6, and the shaded region to the left of it represents all values less than or equal to 6."
