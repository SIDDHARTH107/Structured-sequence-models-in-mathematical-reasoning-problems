    "message_2": "To compute the Cartan connection $\\mathcal{A}$ on $FM$ induced by the spin connection $\\omega$, we first need to recall some definitions and properties.\n\n1. A Cartan connection is a principal connection on a principal bundle $P(M, G)$ with structure group $G$ that is modeled on a homogeneous space $G/H$.\n\n2. The frame bundle $FM$ is a principal bundle with structure group $GL(n, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n3. The spin connection $\\omega$ is a connection 1-form on $FM$ taking values in the Lie algebra of $GL(n, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific case of $M = \\mathbb{S}^2$. The tangent space at any point of $\\mathbb{S}^2$ is a 2-dimensional vector space, so we have $n = 2$. The frame bundle $FM$ has structure group $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The spin structure on $\\mathbb{S}^2$ induces a spin connection $\\omega$ on $FM$.\n\nTo compute the Cartan connection $\\mathcal{A}$ on $FM$ induced by $\\omega$, we need to find a homogeneous space $G/H$ that models the geometry of $\\mathbb{S}^2$. In this case, we can take $G = SO(3)$ and $H = SO(2)$, since $\\mathbb{S}^2$ can be identified with the homogeneous space $SO(3)/SO(2)$.\n\nNow, we can compute the Cartan connection $\\mathcal{A}$ on $FM$ as follows:\n\n1. Lift the spin connection $\\omega$ to a connection 1-form $\\tilde{\\omega}$ on the associated bundle $P(M, G) = FM \\times_{GL(2, \\mathbb{R})} G$ with structure group $G = SO(3)$. This can be done using the natural projection $\\pi: GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to SO(3)$.\n\n2. Compute the curvature 2-form $\\Omega$ of $\\tilde{\\omega}$, which takes values in the Lie algebra of $SO(3)$.\n\n3. Define the Cartan connection $\\mathcal{A}$ on $FM$ as the unique connection 1-form on $FM$ that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n   a. $\\mathcal{A}$ takes values in the Lie algebra of $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n   \n   b. The curvature 2-form of $\\mathcal{A}$ is equal to the curvature 2-form $\\Omega$ of $\\tilde{\\omega}$.\n   \n   c. The Cartan connection $\\mathcal{A}$ is compatible with the spin structure on $\\mathbb{S}^2$.\n\nIn general, the explicit computation of the Cartan connection $\\mathcal{A}$ requires solving a system of partial differential equations. However, the main idea is to use the spin connection $\\omega$ and the geometry of the homogeneous space $G/H$ to construct a connection 1-form on $FM$ that captures the geometric properties of the spin structure on $\\mathbb{S}^2$."
