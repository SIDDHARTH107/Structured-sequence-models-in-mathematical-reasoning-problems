    "message_2": "Let G be a non-abelian group of order 20. The order of G is 20 = 2^2 * 5, so by the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup (let's call it P) and a Sylow 2-subgroup (let's call it Q).\n\nSince P is normal in G and has order 5, it must be isomorphic to Z_5 (the cyclic group of order 5). Now, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroup Q. The order of Q is 4, so it must be either isomorphic to Z_4 (the cyclic group of order 4) or V_4 (the Klein four-group).\n\nIf Q is isomorphic to Z_4, then G would be a semi-direct product of P and Q, and there is only one non-trivial semi-direct product in this case, which is the dihedral group D_10 of order 20. In this case, there are two subgroups of order 4 in G, namely the subgroups generated by the reflections in D_10.\n\nIf Q is isomorphic to V_4, then G would again be a semi-direct product of P and Q. However, since G is non-abelian, the semi-direct product must be non-trivial. In this case, G would be isomorphic to the Frobenius group of order 20. In this case, there are three subgroups of order 4 in G, namely the subgroups generated by the non-identity elements in Q.\n\nIn conclusion, every non-abelian group of order 20 has either two or three subgroups of order 4."
