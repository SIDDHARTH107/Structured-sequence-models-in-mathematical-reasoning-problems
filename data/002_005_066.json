    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has length 10cm, width 5cm, and height 8cm. Find the length of its diagonal.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h) of the prism:\n\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: length (l) = 10 cm, width (w) = 5 cm, and height (h) = 8 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nd^2 = (10)^2 + (5)^2 + (8)^2\nd^2 = 100 + 25 + 64\nd^2 = 189\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 189 to get the length of the diagonal:\n\nd = √189 ≈ 13.75 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 13.75 cm."
