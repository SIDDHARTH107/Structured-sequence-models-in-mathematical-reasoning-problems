    "message_2": "To find the exact value of sin(60°) using the unit circle, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2. \n\nFirst, convert 60° to radians: 60° * (π/180) = π/3 radians.\n\nNow, consider a 30-60-90 triangle inscribed in the unit circle, with the 60° angle at the origin. The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius of the unit circle, which is 1. The side opposite the 60° angle is the vertical side, and its length represents the y-coordinate of the point where the hypotenuse intersects the circle.\n\nSince the sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2, and the hypotenuse is 1, we can find the length of the side opposite the 60° angle by dividing the hypotenuse by 2:\n\n1/2 = 0.5\n\nSo, the exact value of sin(60°) is 0.5."
