    "message_1": "A flagpole is standing vertically on the ground. If the angle of elevation of the top of the flagpole from a point 30 meters away from its base is 52 degrees, what is the height of the flagpole? Round your answer to the nearest tenth.",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the flagpole, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 52 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the point to the base of the flagpole (30 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the flagpole (which we want to find).\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\ntan(52°) = height / 30\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 30:\n\nheight = 30 * tan(52°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 52 degrees and multiply it by 30:\n\nheight ≈ 30 * 1.2799\nheight ≈ 38.397\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth, the height of the flagpole is approximately 38.4 meters."
