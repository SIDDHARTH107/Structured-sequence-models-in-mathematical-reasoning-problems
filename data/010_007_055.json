    "message_2": "To find the fundamental group of X-A, we will first consider the space X-A and then apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem.\n\nThe space X-A is a circle of radius 2 centered at (1,0) with the upper half removed. This space is homeomorphic to an open interval, which can be seen by \"unrolling\" the remaining part of the circle into a straight line. Since the open interval is contractible, its fundamental group is trivial.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of X-A is the trivial group, denoted by either {1} or {e}, where 1 or e represents the identity element."
