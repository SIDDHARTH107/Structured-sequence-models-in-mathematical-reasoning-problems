    "message_2": "To find the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of matrix A using the power iteration method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose an initial vector b0 with non-zero components.\n2. Compute the matrix-vector product Ab0.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector to get b1.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the vector converges.\n\nLet's choose the initial vector b0 = [1; 1]. Now we will perform the power iteration method.\n\nIteration 1:\nAb0 = A[1; 1] = [3*1 + 2*1; 4*1 + 1*1] = [5; 5]\nNormalize: b1 = [5/√50; 5/√50] = [1/√2; 1/√2]\n\nIteration 2:\nAb1 = A[1/√2; 1/√2] = [3*(1/√2) + 2*(1/√2); 4*(1/√2) + 1*(1/√2)] = [5/√2; 5/√2]\nNormalize: b2 = [5/√50; 5/√50] = [1/√2; 1/√2]\n\nSince b2 is the same as b1, the vector has converged. Therefore, the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of matrix A is [1/√2; 1/√2]."
