    "message_2": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm is a population-based optimization technique inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. To find the global minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 12 within the range of x = [-5, 5] using the ABC algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of solutions (food sources) randomly within the given range.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution.\n3. Perform the employed bee phase: for each solution, generate a new candidate solution by modifying the current solution and evaluate its fitness. If the new solution is better, replace the current solution with the new one.\n4. Perform the onlooker bee phase: select solutions based on their fitness (better solutions have a higher probability of being selected) and generate new candidate solutions as in the employed bee phase. Replace the current solutions with the new ones if they are better.\n5. Perform the scout bee phase: if a solution has not been improved for a certain number of iterations, replace it with a new randomly generated solution.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for a predetermined number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n7. The best solution found during the search process represents the global minimum value of the function.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the ABC algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 - 6*x**2 + 9*x + 12\n\ndef fitness(x):\n    return 1 / (1 + f(x))\n\ndef generate_new_solution(x, population):\n    phi = random.uniform(-1, 1)\n    partner = random.choice(population)\n    new_x = x + phi * (x - partner)\n    return new_x\n\ndef abc_algorithm(population_size, max_iterations, range_x):\n    # Initialize the population\n    population = [random.uniform(range_x[0], range_x[1]) for _ in range(population_size)]\n    best_solution = min(population, key=f)\n\n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        # Employed bee phase\n        for i in range(population_size):\n            new_solution = generate_new_solution(population[i], population)\n            if fitness(new_solution) > fitness(population[i]):\n                population[i] = new_solution\n\n        # Onlooker bee phase\n        probabilities = [fitness(x) / sum(fitness(x) for x in population) for x in population]\n        for i in range(population_size):\n            selected_solution = np.random.choice(population, p=probabilities)\n            new_solution = generate_new_solution(selected_solution, population)\n            if fitness(new_solution) > fitness(selected_solution):\n                population[population.index(selected_solution)] = new_solution\n\n        # Scout bee phase is not implemented in this simple example\n\n        # Update the best solution\n        current_best_solution = min(population, key=f)\n        if f(current_best_solution) < f(best_solution):\n            best_solution = current_best_solution\n\n    return best_solution, f(best_solution)\n\npopulation_size = 50\nmax_iterations = 100\nrange_x = [-5, 5]\n\nbest_solution, min_value = abc_algorithm(population_size, max_iterations, range_x)\nprint(f\"Best solution: x = {best_solution}, f(x) = {min_value}\")\n```\n\nPlease note that this implementation is simplified and may not always find the exact global minimum. You can adjust the parameters (population_size, max_iterations) and improve the algorithm to increase its accuracy and performance."
