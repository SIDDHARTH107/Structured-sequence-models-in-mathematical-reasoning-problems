    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it covers every point in a square without crossing itself. The Peano curve of order 3 is constructed by dividing the square into 9 smaller squares and connecting them in a specific pattern. \n\nFor the Peano curve of order 1, the curve consists of 3 segments, each with a length of 1/3 units. \n\nTo construct the Peano curve of order 2, we replace each segment of the order 1 curve with a smaller version of the curve, scaled down by a factor of 3. This means that the total length of the order 2 curve is 3 times the length of the order 1 curve, which is 3 * (3 * (1/3)) = 9 * (1/3) units.\n\nSimilarly, to construct the Peano curve of order 3, we replace each segment of the order 2 curve with a smaller version of the curve, scaled down by a factor of 3. This means that the total length of the order 3 curve is 3 times the length of the order 2 curve, which is 3 * (9 * (1/3)) = 27 * (1/3) units.\n\nSo, the total length of the Peano curve of order 3 when constructed on a square with a side length of 1 unit is 27 * (1/3) = 9 units."
