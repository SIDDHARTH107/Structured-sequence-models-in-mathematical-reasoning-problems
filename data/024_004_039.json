    "message_2": "To find the mean curvature of the surface z = 2x^2 + 3y^2 at the point (1,1,5), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parameterize the surface as follows:\nr(u,v) = (u, v, 2u^2 + 3v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first partial derivatives:\nr_u = (1, 0, 4u)\nr_v = (0, 1, 6v)\n\nAnd the second partial derivatives:\nr_uu = (0, 0, 4)\nr_uv = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = (0, 0, 6)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form coefficients:\nE = r_u • r_u = 1 + 16u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = 24uv\nG = r_v • r_v = 1 + 36v^2\n\nAt the point (1,1,5), we have:\nE(1,1) = 17\nF(1,1) = 24\nG(1,1) = 37\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form coefficients:\ne = r_uu • N = -4\nf = r_uv • N = 0\ng = r_vv • N = -6\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface.\n\nFinally, we compute the mean curvature H:\nH = (eG + gE - 2fF) / (2(EG - F^2))\n\nPlugging in the values at the point (1,1,5):\nH = (-4*37 + (-6)*17 - 2*0*24) / (2*(17*37 - 24^2))\nH = (-148 - 102) / (2*(629 - 576))\nH = (-250) / (2*53)\nH = -250 / 106\n\nSo, the mean curvature of the surface at the point (1,1,5) is H = -250/106."
