    "message_2": "The forced van der Pol oscillator is described by the following differential equation:\n\nx''(t) - µ(1 - x^2(t))x'(t) + ω₀²x(t) = F₀sin(ωt)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement, µ is the damping factor, ω₀ is the natural frequency, F₀ is the amplitude of the forcing function, and ω is the angular frequency of the forcing function.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the following values:\n\nForcing function: sin(2t) => ω = 2\nNatural frequency: ω₀ = 1\nDamping factor: µ = 0.1\nAmplitude of oscillation: F₀ = 2\n\nThe period of the forced van der Pol oscillator is determined by the period of the forcing function. The period T of a sinusoidal function with angular frequency ω is given by:\n\nT = 2π / ω\n\nIn this case, ω = 2, so the period T is:\n\nT = 2π / 2 = π\n\nTherefore, the period of the forced van der Pol oscillator is π."
