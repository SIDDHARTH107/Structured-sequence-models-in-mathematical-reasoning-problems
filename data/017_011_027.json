    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to C12, A4, or D6, we will analyze the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems and compare them to the structures of these three groups.\n\nFirst, let's recall the Sylow theorems:\n\n1. For a prime p, if p^k divides the order of G (|G|), then G has a subgroup of order p^k.\n2. All subgroups of order p^k are conjugate to each other.\n3. The number of subgroups of order p^k divides the index [G : p^k], and is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nNow, let's analyze the group G of order 12. The prime factorization of 12 is 2^2 * 3^1. By the Sylow theorems, G has subgroups of order 2^2 = 4 and 3^1 = 3.\n\nLet n_2 and n_3 be the number of subgroups of order 4 and 3, respectively. By the third Sylow theorem, n_2 divides 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, n_3 divides 4 and is congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has a unique subgroup of order 4 and a unique subgroup of order 3. By the second Sylow theorem, these subgroups are normal. Since their orders are coprime, their intersection is trivial, and their product has order 4 * 3 = 12. Thus, G is the internal direct product of these two normal subgroups, which implies that G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C12.\n\n2. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1: In this case, G has three subgroups of order 4 and a unique subgroup of order 3. The unique subgroup of order 3 is normal, and since its order is coprime to the order of the subgroups of order 4, it must intersect them trivially. The three subgroups of order 4 generate a subgroup of G isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4. The structure of G in this case is similar to that of the alternating group A4, which also has three subgroups of order 4 and a normal subgroup of order 3. Thus, G is isomorphic to A4.\n\n3. n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4: This case is not possible, as it would imply that there are four normal subgroups of order 3, which contradicts the fact that the intersection of all subgroups of order 3 must be trivial.\n\n4. n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4: This case is also not possible, as it would imply that there are too many elements of order 2 and 3, exceeding the total number of elements in G.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12 or the alternating group A4, depending on the number of subgroups of order 4. G cannot be isomorphic to the dihedral group D6, as D6 has six subgroups of order 2, which is not consistent with the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems."
