The distance between each suburb is given as follows:\n\nSuburb A to Suburb B = 6 km\nSuburb A to Suburb C = 9 km\nSuburb B to Suburb C = 10 km\nSuburb B to Suburb D = 5 km\nSuburb C to Suburb D = 8 km\nSuburb C to Suburb E = 7 km\nSuburb D to Suburb E = 12 km\n\nUsing Prim's algorithm, find the minimum spanning tree for this graph to determine the most cost-effective way for the company to connect all the suburbs with cable lines. What is the total distance of the cable lines needed for the minimum spanning tree?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm, we start with an arbitrary vertex and then iteratively add the shortest edge that connects a new vertex to the existing tree. We repeat this process until all vertices are included in the tree.\n\n1. Start with Suburb A (arbitrary choice).\n2. The shortest edge connected to A is AB (6 km). Add AB to the tree.\n3. The shortest edge connected to A or B is BD (5 km). Add BD to the tree.\n4. The shortest edge connected to A, B, or D is CD (8 km). Add CD to the tree.\n5. The shortest edge connected to A, B, C, or D is CE (7 km). Add CE to the tree.\n\nNow all suburbs are connected. The minimum spanning tree includes the edges AB, BD, CD, and CE. The total distance of the cable lines needed for the minimum spanning tree is:\n\n6 km (AB) + 5 km (BD) + 8 km (CD) + 7 km (CE) = 26 km."
