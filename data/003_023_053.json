    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B in 3-dimensional space, we can use the following formula:\n\nC = A x B = (A_y * B_z - A_z * B_y, A_z * B_x - A_x * B_z, A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x)\n\nwhere C is the resulting cross product vector, and A_x, A_y, A_z, B_x, B_y, B_z are the components of vectors A and B, respectively.\n\nIn this case, vector A has components [2, 3, 4] and vector B has components [5, 1, 2]. So, we have:\n\nA_x = 2, A_y = 3, A_z = 4\nB_x = 5, B_y = 1, B_z = 2\n\nNow, we can calculate the components of the cross product vector C:\n\nC_x = A_y * B_z - A_z * B_y = 3 * 2 - 4 * 1 = 6 - 4 = 2\nC_y = A_z * B_x - A_x * B_z = 4 * 5 - 2 * 2 = 20 - 4 = 16\nC_z = A_x * B_y - A_y * B_x = 2 * 1 - 3 * 5 = 2 - 15 = -13\n\nSo, the cross product of vector A and B is:\n\nC = [2, 16, -13]"
