    "message_2": "Since A is non-empty and compact, there exists a point p ∈ A such that the gradient of f at p is zero, i.e., ∇f(p) = 0. This is because if there were no such point, then the gradient of f would be non-zero everywhere on A, and we could construct a smooth vector field on A with no zeros, which contradicts the Poincaré-Hopf theorem.\n\nNow, let's consider the Hessian matrix of f at p, denoted by H(f)(p). The Hessian matrix is a symmetric matrix, so it can be diagonalized with real eigenvalues. Let λ₁ and λ₂ be the eigenvalues of H(f)(p). We want to show that H(f)(p) is positive semidefinite, which means that λ₁ ≥ 0 and λ₂ ≥ 0.\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that both λ₁ < 0 and λ₂ < 0. Then, there exists a neighborhood U of p in M such that for all x ∈ U, the Hessian matrix H(f)(x) has negative eigenvalues. This implies that f is locally concave at p.\n\nNow, let's consider the Taylor expansion of f around p:\n\nf(x) = f(p) + ⟨∇f(p), x - p⟩ + 1/2 (x - p)ᵀ H(f)(p) (x - p) + o(‖x - p‖²).\n\nSince f(p) = 0, ∇f(p) = 0, and H(f)(p) is negative definite, we have\n\nf(x) < 0 for all x ∈ U, x ≠ p.\n\nThis contradicts the fact that p is in A, since A is the set of points where f(x) = 0. Therefore, our assumption that both λ₁ < 0 and λ₂ < 0 must be false.\n\nThus, there exists a point p ∈ A such that the Hessian matrix of f at p is positive semidefinite."
