    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 20, 30, and 45, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n20 = 2^2 * 5\n30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n45 = 3^2 * 5\n\n2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor in the given numbers:\n2^2, 3^2, and 5\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\nLCM = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180\n\nSo, the LCM of 20, 30, and 45 is 180."
