    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to determine the length of the third side. Since we have an angle and two sides given, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side.\n\nLet's label the triangle with vertices A, B, and C, where angle A is 60°, side a (opposite angle A) is the unknown side, side b (opposite angle B) is 5 cm, and side c (opposite angle C) is 8 cm.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\n\na² = b² + c² - 2bc * cos(A)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\na² = 5² + 8² - 2(5)(8) * cos(60°)\n\na² = 25 + 64 - 80 * (1/2) [Note: cos(60°) = 1/2]\n\na² = 25 + 64 - 40\n\na² = 49\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\na = √49\n\na = 7 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of the third side, we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\n\nPerimeter = 7 + 5 + 8\n\nPerimeter = 20 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 20 cm."
