    "message_1": "Question: Suppose there are three doors A, B, and C, and one of them has a prize behind it. You are asked to pick one of the doors. After you make your choice, the host (who knows what is behind each door) opens one of the other two doors, revealing that there is no prize behind it. The host then asks if you want to switch your choice to the remaining unopened door or stick with your original choice. What is the best strategy to maximize your chances of winning the prize, and what is the probability of winning the prize with that strategy?",
    "message_2": "The best strategy to maximize your chances of winning the prize is to always switch your choice to the remaining unopened door after the host reveals one door with no prize behind it. This is known as the Monty Hall problem.\n\nHere's why switching is the best strategy:\n\n1. When you initially pick a door, there is a 1/3 chance that you picked the door with the prize and a 2/3 chance that the prize is behind one of the other two doors.\n\n2. When the host opens one of the other two doors (which they can always do because they know where the prize is), they are essentially giving you information about the location of the prize. If you initially picked the wrong door (which happens with a 2/3 probability), then the host is showing you the only other wrong door, leaving the door with the prize as the remaining unopened door.\n\n3. Therefore, by switching your choice to the remaining unopened door, you are essentially \"capturing\" the 2/3 probability that you initially picked the wrong door.\n\nSo, the probability of winning the prize by always switching your choice is 2/3 or approximately 66.67%."
