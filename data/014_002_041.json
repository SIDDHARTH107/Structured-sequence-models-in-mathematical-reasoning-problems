Alice chooses a secret number a = 3, and Bob chooses a secret number b = 5. What is the shared secret key that they can use to communicate securely?",
    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where g = 2, a = 3, and p = 11.\n   A = 2^3 mod 11\n   A = 8 mod 11\n   A = 8\n\n2. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where g = 2, b = 5, and p = 11.\n   B = 2^5 mod 11\n   B = 32 mod 11\n   B = 10\n\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p, where B = 10, a = 3, and p = 11.\n   K_A = 10^3 mod 11\n   K_A = 1000 mod 11\n   K_A = 1\n\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p, where A = 8, b = 5, and p = 11.\n   K_B = 8^5 mod 11\n   K_B = 32768 mod 11\n   K_B = 1\n\nSince K_A = K_B, the shared secret key is 1. Alice and Bob can now use this key to communicate securely."
