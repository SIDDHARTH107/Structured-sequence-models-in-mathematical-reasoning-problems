First, let's consider the edge between vertices 1 and 2. We will delete this edge and contract it.\n\n- Deletion: Remove the edge between vertices 1 and 2. The resulting graph G' is:\n\n```\n    1   2\n   / \\ / \n  3---4\n   \\ / \n    5\n```\n\n- Contraction: Merge vertices 1 and 2 into a single vertex, say 1', and remove any duplicate edges. The resulting graph G'' is:\n\n```\n    1'\n   / \\\n  3---4\n   \\ /\n    5\n```\n\nNow, we have P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k).\n\n2. Next, we need to find the chromatic polynomial for G' and G''.\n\n- For G', we can see that it is a tree with 5 vertices. The chromatic polynomial of a tree with n vertices is k(k-1)^(n-1). So, P(G', k) = k(k-1)^4.\n\n- For G'', we can see that it is a cycle with 4 vertices. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle with an even number of vertices is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1). So, P(G'', k) = (k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1).\n\n3. Finally, substitute the chromatic polynomials of G' and G'' back into the equation for P(G, k):\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k) = k(k-1)^4 - [(k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1)]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^4 - (k-1)^4 - (k-1)\n\nP(G, k) = (k-1)^4(k - 1) - (k-1)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G is P(G, k) = (k-1)^4(k - 1) - (k-1)."
