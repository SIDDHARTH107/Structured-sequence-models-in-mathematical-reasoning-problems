    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the vector space $H^1(C, \\mathbb{C})$, we can use the Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor $D$ on a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g$, we have:\n\n$l(D) - l(K - D) = \\deg(D) + 1 - g$,\n\nwhere $l(D)$ is the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions with poles bounded by $D$, $K$ is the canonical divisor, and $\\deg(D)$ is the degree of the divisor $D$.\n\nIn our case, we want to compute the dimension of the first cohomology group, which is related to the genus $g$ of the curve $C$. To find the genus, we can use the genus-degree formula for a plane algebraic curve:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d - 1)(d - 2)}{2}$,\n\nwhere $d$ is the degree of the curve. In our case, the curve is given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x + 4$, which is a degree 3 curve. Plugging this into the genus-degree formula, we get:\n\n$g = \\frac{(3 - 1)(3 - 2)}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2} = 1$.\n\nThus, the genus of the curve $C$ is 1, and the dimension of the vector space $H^1(C, \\mathbb{C})$ is also 1."
