    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (or clique) in the graph. A complete subgraph is a subgraph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's analyze the graph G with the given edge set:\n\n1. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n2. Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 5.\n3. Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 2 and 4.\n4. Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 3, 5, and 6.\n5. Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1, 2, and 4.\n6. Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 4.\n\nNow, let's find the largest complete subgraph in G:\n\n1. There is no complete subgraph with all 6 vertices since not all vertices are connected to each other.\n2. There is no complete subgraph with 5 vertices since there is no vertex connected to all other vertices except itself.\n3. Let's check for complete subgraphs with 4 vertices:\n   - Subgraph with vertices {1, 2, 4, 5} is complete since all pairs of vertices are connected: (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 5).\n   - There are no other complete subgraphs with 4 vertices.\n\nThus, the largest complete subgraph in G has 4 vertices, and the clique number of G is 4."
