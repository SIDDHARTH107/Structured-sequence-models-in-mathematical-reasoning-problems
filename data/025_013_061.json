    "message_2": "To calculate the Jacobian of the curve given by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 1$ at the point $(1,2)$, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to $x$ and $y$. Let $F(x,y) = y^2 - x^3 - 2x - 1$. Then, the Jacobian matrix is given by:\n\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the Jacobian matrix at the point $(1,2)$:\n\n$$\nJ(1,2) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-3(1)^2 - 2 & 2(2)\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n-5 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nSo, the Jacobian of the curve at the point $(1,2)$ is $\\begin{bmatrix}\n-5 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}$."
