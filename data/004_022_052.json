    "message_1": "A cable company has been tasked with connecting a rural village to the internet via fiber optic cable. The cost of laying the cable is $10 per meter. The company has an initial budget of $25,000 to complete the project. The village is located on a mountain, and the cable must follow the curve of the mountain, which is described by the equation y = x^2. \n\nWhat is the maximum distance, in meters, that the cable can be laid from the starting point in the village to the ending point at the top of the mountain, while staying within the $25,000 budget?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum distance the cable can be laid, we first need to determine the length of the cable that can be purchased with the given budget. Since the cost of laying the cable is $10 per meter and the budget is $25,000, we can calculate the total length of cable that can be purchased:\n\nTotal length of cable = Budget / Cost per meter\nTotal length of cable = $25,000 / $10 per meter\nTotal length of cable = 2,500 meters\n\nNow, we need to find the distance along the curve of the mountain that the cable can be laid. The curve of the mountain is described by the equation y = x^2. To find the distance along the curve, we need to calculate the arc length of the curve. The arc length of a curve can be found using the formula:\n\nArc length = ∫√(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nwhere dy/dx is the derivative of the curve with respect to x. In this case, the curve is y = x^2, so the derivative is:\n\ndy/dx = 2x\n\nNow, we can plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nArc length = ∫√(1 + (2x)^2) dx\n\nTo find the maximum distance the cable can be laid, we need to find the value of x for which the arc length is equal to the total length of cable (2,500 meters). We can set up the equation:\n\n2,500 = ∫√(1 + (2x)^2) dx\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a closed-form solution, so we need to use numerical methods to find the value of x. Using a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or the trapezoidal rule, we can approximate the value of x for which the arc length is equal to 2,500 meters.\n\nUsing a numerical integration method, we find that the maximum distance the cable can be laid along the curve of the mountain is approximately x ≈ 19.6 meters."
