    "message_2": "Since the given signal f(t) is periodic with period T = 1s, we can use the Fourier series representation to determine the frequency content and amplitudes of the sinusoidal components. The Fourier series representation of a periodic function is given by:\n\nf(t) = a0 + Σ[an * cos(2πnft) + bn * sin(2πnft)]\n\nwhere a0, an, and bn are the Fourier coefficients, and f is the fundamental frequency (1/T).\n\nFor the given signal, f(t) = 2sin(2πt) + 3sin(4πt) + 4sin(6πt), we can observe that there are no cosine terms, and the signal is already in the Fourier series form. Therefore, we can directly read off the frequency content and amplitudes of the sinusoidal components:\n\n1. First sinusoidal component:\n   Frequency: 2π (1 Hz)\n   Amplitude: 2\n\n2. Second sinusoidal component:\n   Frequency: 4π (2 Hz)\n   Amplitude: 3\n\n3. Third sinusoidal component:\n   Frequency: 6π (3 Hz)\n   Amplitude: 4\n\nSo, the frequency content of the signal consists of sinusoidal components at 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 3 Hz, with amplitudes 2, 3, and 4, respectively."
