    "message_2": "To find the momentum-space wave function ϕ(p), we need to calculate the Fourier transform of the position-space wave function ψ(x). The Fourier transform is defined as:\n\nϕ(p) = (1/√(2πħ)) ∫[ψ(x) * exp(-ipx/ħ)] dx\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant. In our case, ψ(x) = A sin(πx/a) for 0 ≤ x ≤ a, and ψ(x) = 0 elsewhere. Therefore, we can write the integral expression for ϕ(p) as:\n\nϕ(p) = (1/√(2πħ)) ∫[A sin(πx/a) * exp(-ipx/ħ)] dx, with the integral taken from 0 to a.\n\nNow, let's solve this integral. We can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = A sin(πx/a) and dv = exp(-ipx/ħ) dx.\nThen, du = (Aπ/a) cos(πx/a) dx and v = (-iħ/p) exp(-ipx/ħ).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nϕ(p) = (1/√(2πħ)) [(A(-iħ/p) sin(πx/a) exp(-ipx/ħ))|₀^a - ∫((-iħ/p) (Aπ/a) cos(πx/a) exp(-ipx/ħ)) dx]\n\nThe first term in the square brackets vanishes at both x = 0 and x = a because sin(πx/a) = 0 at these points. So, we are left with the integral:\n\nϕ(p) = (1/√(2πħ)) (iAπħ/ap) ∫[cos(πx/a) * exp(-ipx/ħ)] dx, with the integral taken from 0 to a.\n\nNow, let's perform another integration by parts:\n\nLet u = cos(πx/a) and dv = exp(-ipx/ħ) dx.\nThen, du = -(π/a) sin(πx/a) dx and v = (-iħ/p) exp(-ipx/ħ).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nϕ(p) = (iAπħ/ap) [(cos(πx/a)(-iħ/p) exp(-ipx/ħ))|₀^a + (π/a) ∫(sin(πx/a) exp(-ipx/ħ)) dx]\n\nThe first term in the square brackets vanishes at both x = 0 and x = a because cos(πx/a) = 0 at these points. So, we are left with the integral:\n\nϕ(p) = (iAπ^2ħ^2/ap^2) ∫[sin(πx/a) * exp(-ipx/ħ)] dx, with the integral taken from 0 to a.\n\nThis integral is the same as the one we started with, but with an extra factor of (iπħ/p). Therefore,\n\nϕ(p) = (iAπ^2ħ^2/ap^2) * (iħ/p) * ϕ(p)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nϕ(p) = (Aπ^2ħ^3/ap^3) * ϕ(p)\n\nNow, we can solve for ϕ(p):\n\nϕ(p) = (Aπ^2ħ^3/ap^3) * ϕ(p)\n\nϕ(p) = A * (π^2ħ^3/ap^3) * ϕ(p)\n\nSince A is a normalization constant, we can absorb the factor (π^2ħ^3/ap^3) into it. Thus, the momentum-space wave function is:\n\nϕ(p) = A' * ϕ(p)\n\nwhere A' is a new normalization constant."
