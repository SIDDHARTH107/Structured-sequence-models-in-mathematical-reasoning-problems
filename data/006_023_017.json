    "message_1": "In a survey conducted in a local market, it was found that the probability of a consumer buying a product A is 0.3 and the probability of buying a product B is 0.5. Given that there is a 0.2 probability that a consumer will buy both product A and B, what is the probability that a consumer will buy either product A or B?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a consumer will buy either product A or B, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere P(A) is the probability of buying product A, P(B) is the probability of buying product B, and P(A ∩ B) is the probability of buying both products A and B.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.3 + 0.5 - 0.2\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.8 - 0.2\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.6\n\nSo, the probability that a consumer will buy either product A or B is 0.6 or 60%."
