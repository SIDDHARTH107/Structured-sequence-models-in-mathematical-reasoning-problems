    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept of a polynomial equation, we need to set the function equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x - 4\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding the exact roots can be a bit more complicated. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, -4) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1).\n\nFactors of -4: ±1, ±2, ±4\nFactors of 1: ±1\n\nPossible rational roots: ±1, ±2, ±4\n\nNow, we can test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\n1. f(1) = (1)^3 - 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 4 = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2 (not a root)\n2. f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 4 = -1 - 2 - 3 - 4 = -10 (not a root)\n3. f(2) = (2)^3 - 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 4 = 8 - 8 + 6 - 4 = 2 (not a root)\n4. f(-2) = (-2)^3 - 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 4 = -8 - 8 - 6 - 4 = -26 (not a root)\n5. f(4) = (4)^3 - 2(4)^2 + 3(4) - 4 = 64 - 32 + 12 - 4 = 40 (not a root)\n6. f(-4) = (-4)^3 - 2(-4)^2 + 3(-4) - 4 = -64 - 32 - 12 - 4 = -112 (not a root)\n\nNone of the possible rational roots are actual roots of the equation. This means that the x-intercept is an irrational number or a complex number. To find the exact x-intercept, we would need to use more advanced techniques such as numerical methods or factoring the polynomial using complex numbers."
