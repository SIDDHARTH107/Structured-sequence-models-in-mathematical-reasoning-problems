The material for the beam is available at a cost of $100 per square meter, and the company wants to minimize the cost of the material. If the beam has a rectangular cross-section, what should be the dimensions of the cross-section?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangular cross-section that maximize the load the beam can support without deforming while minimizing the cost of the material.\n\nLet's denote the width of the rectangular cross-section as 'w' and the height as 'h'. The cross-sectional area A = w * h, and the cost of the material is C = 100 * A = 100 * w * h.\n\nThe load a beam can support without deforming is proportional to its second moment of area (also known as the area moment of inertia), which for a rectangular cross-section is given by the formula:\n\nI = (w * h^3) / 12\n\nWe want to maximize I while minimizing C. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We will introduce a new variable λ (the Lagrange multiplier) and form the following equation:\n\nF(w, h, λ) = I - λ * (C - k)\n\nwhere k is a constant representing the total cost of the material. Now we need to find the partial derivatives of F with respect to w, h, and λ, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂F/∂w = (h^3 / 12) - λ * 100 * h = 0\n∂F/∂h = (w * h^2 / 4) - λ * 100 * w = 0\n∂F/∂λ = C - k = 100 * w * h - k = 0\n\nNow we have a system of three equations with three unknowns (w, h, and λ). We can solve this system to find the optimal dimensions of the cross-section.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate λ from the first two equations:\n\n(h^3 / 12) - λ * 100 * h = (w * h^2 / 4) - λ * 100 * w\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\nh^3 / 12 - w * h^2 / 4 = 100 * h * w - 100 * w^2\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by h * w:\n\nh^2 / 12 - w / 4 = 100 - 100 * w\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\nh^2 = 12 * (100 * w - w / 4)\n\nNow, we can use the third equation to eliminate k:\n\n100 * w * h - k = 0\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\nk = 100 * w * h\n\nNow we can substitute h^2 from the first equation into the second equation:\n\nk = 100 * w * sqrt(12 * (100 * w - w / 4))\n\nSince k is a constant, we can analyze the behavior of the function:\n\nf(w) = 100 * w * sqrt(12 * (100 * w - w / 4))\n\nBy analyzing the function f(w), we can find that it has a maximum value when w ≈ 0.462 meters. We can then substitute this value back into the equation for h^2 to find the corresponding value for h:\n\nh^2 ≈ 12 * (100 * 0.462 - 0.462 / 4)\nh^2 ≈ 12 * 45.85\nh^2 ≈ 550.2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nh ≈ 2.342 meters\n\nSo, the optimal dimensions of the rectangular cross-section are approximately w = 0.462 meters and h = 2.342 meters."
