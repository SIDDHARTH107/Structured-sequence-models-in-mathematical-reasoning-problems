    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = cos(x) + sin(2x) with respect to x, we'll use the chain rule and the sum rule.\n\nThe sum rule states that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives. So, we'll find the derivatives of cos(x) and sin(2x) separately.\n\nThe derivative of cos(x) with respect to x is -sin(x).\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x. The derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u), and the derivative of 2x with respect to x is 2.\n\nSo, the derivative of sin(2x) with respect to x is cos(2x) * 2 = 2cos(2x).\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of the entire function:\n\ndy/dx = -sin(x) + 2cos(2x)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the derivative at x = pi/4:\n\ndy/dx(pi/4) = -sin(pi/4) + 2cos(2 * pi/4)\n\ndy/dx(pi/4) = -sin(pi/4) + 2cos(pi/2)\n\nsin(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 and cos(pi/2) = 0, so:\n\ndy/dx(pi/4) = -(sqrt(2)/2) + 2(0)\n\ndy/dx(pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2\n\nSo, the derivative of y = cos(x) + sin(2x) at x = pi/4 is -sqrt(2)/2."
