    "message_2": "First, let's solve the system using Gaussian elimination without considering the measurement uncertainty.\n\n1. Write down the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n| 3  4  2 | 10 |\n| 2 -1  3 |  4 |\n| 4  3  2 |  8 |\n\n2. Perform row operations to get the matrix into row-echelon form:\n\nR2 = R2 - (2/3)R1, R3 = R3 - (4/3)R1\n\n|  3   4   2 |  10  |\n|  0  -3   5 |  -2  |\n|  0  -1  -2 |  -8  |\n\nR3 = R3 - (1/3)R2\n\n|  3   4   2 |  10  |\n|  0  -3   5 |  -2  |\n|  0   0  -7 | -10  |\n\n3. Perform back-substitution to find the solution:\n\nz = (-10/-7) = 10/7\ny = (-2 - 5z)/-3 = (-2 - 5(10/7))/(-3) = 6/7\nx = (10 - 4y - 2z)/3 = (10 - 4(6/7) - 2(10/7))/3 = 2/7\n\nSo, the solution is x = 2/7, y = 6/7, and z = 10/7.\n\nNow, let's consider the measurement uncertainty of ± 0.05. Since the uncertainty affects the constants in the equations, the uncertainty will propagate through the calculations. However, it is difficult to quantify the exact effect of the uncertainty on the final solution using Gaussian elimination. Instead, you can use other methods like interval arithmetic or Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the range of possible solutions considering the uncertainty."
