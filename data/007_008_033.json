    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nWe can rewrite this theorem as a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) when a and p are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the remainder when 7^29 is divided by 31. Since 7 and 31 are coprime, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n7^(31-1) ≡ 1 (mod 31)\n7^30 ≡ 1 (mod 31)\n\nNow, we can rewrite 7^29 as (7^30) * (7^(-1)). Since we know that 7^30 ≡ 1 (mod 31), we can write:\n\n7^29 ≡ 1 * 7^(-1) (mod 31)\n\nTo find the modular inverse of 7 (mod 31), we can use the fact that 7^30 ≡ 1 (mod 31):\n\n7^30 * 7^(-1) ≡ 1 * 7^(-1) (mod 31)\n7^(30-1) ≡ 7^(-1) (mod 31)\n7^29 ≡ 7^(-1) (mod 31)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^29 is divided by 31 is the same as the modular inverse of 7 (mod 31). To find this modular inverse, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or simply try multiplying 7 by different numbers until we find one that gives a product congruent to 1 modulo 31:\n\n7 * 1 ≡ 7 (mod 31)\n7 * 2 ≡ 14 (mod 31)\n7 * 3 ≡ 21 (mod 31)\n7 * 4 ≡ 28 (mod 31)\n7 * 5 ≡ 35 ≡ 4 (mod 31)\n7 * 6 ≡ 42 ≡ 11 (mod 31)\n7 * 7 ≡ 49 ≡ 18 (mod 31)\n7 * 8 ≡ 56 ≡ 25 (mod 31)\n7 * 9 ≡ 63 ≡ 1 (mod 31)\n\nSo, the modular inverse of 7 (mod 31) is 9. Therefore, the remainder when 7^29 is divided by 31 is 9."
