    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator of the 1-form α = 2x dy + 3y dz, we first need to find the components of α with respect to the basis {dy, dz}. In this case, α = (2x, 3y). At the point (1, 2, 3), the components of α are (2, 6).\n\nNow, let's compute the Hodge star operator of α. In a 3-dimensional Euclidean space with the given metric g, the Hodge star operator is defined as:\n\n*α = (1/2) ε^ijk α_j e_k\n\nwhere ε^ijk is the Levi-Civita symbol, and e_k is the basis vector. The Levi-Civita symbol is defined as:\n\nε^ijk = 1 if (i, j, k) is an even permutation of (1, 2, 3)\nε^ijk = -1 if (i, j, k) is an odd permutation of (1, 2, 3)\nε^ijk = 0 otherwise\n\nNow, let's compute the Hodge star operator for α:\n\n*α = (1/2) ε^ijk α_j e_k\n   = (1/2) [(ε^123 α_2 e_3) + (ε^132 α_3 e_2) + (ε^213 α_1 e_3) + (ε^231 α_3 e_1) + (ε^312 α_1 e_2) + (ε^321 α_2 e_1)]\n\nAt the point (1, 2, 3), α = (2, 6). So, we have:\n\n*α = (1/2) [(1 * 6 * dz) - (1 * 0 * dy) - (1 * 0 * dz) + (1 * 0 * dx) - (1 * 2 * dy) + (1 * 0 * dx)]\n   = (1/2) [(6 * dz) - (2 * dy)]\n\nSo, the Hodge star operator of α at the point (1, 2, 3) is:\n\n*α = 3dz - dy"
