    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial x² - 9x + 20, we need to find two binomials (ax + b)(cx + d) such that their product equals the given polynomial.\n\nWe look for two numbers that multiply to 20 (the constant term) and add up to -9 (the coefficient of the linear term). These two numbers are -4 and -5.\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial x² - 9x + 20 is (x - 4)(x - 5)."
