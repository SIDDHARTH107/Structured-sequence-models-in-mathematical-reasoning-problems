    "message_2": "Differential evolution is a global optimization algorithm that is typically used for optimizing complex, non-linear, and non-differentiable functions. However, the given function f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 6 is a quadratic function, which can be easily optimized using calculus. Nevertheless, I will demonstrate the differential evolution approach to solve this problem.\n\n1. Define the objective function: f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 6\n2. Define the search space: [-10, 10]\n3. Set the parameters for differential evolution, such as population size, mutation factor, and crossover probability. For this example, let's use a population size of 20, a mutation factor of 0.8, and a crossover probability of 0.9.\n4. Initialize a random population of 20 individuals within the search space.\n5. Perform the following steps until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a minimum function value threshold):\n   a. For each individual in the population, create a mutant vector by combining the weighted difference of two randomly selected individuals with a third individual.\n   b. Perform crossover between the mutant vector and the original individual to create a trial vector.\n   c. Evaluate the objective function for the trial vector.\n   d. If the trial vector has a better objective function value than the original individual, replace the original individual with the trial vector.\n6. The individual with the best objective function value in the final population is the approximate solution.\n\nApplying the differential evolution algorithm to the given function f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 6 in the interval [-10, 10], we can find the approximate minimum value and the corresponding value of x. However, since this is a stochastic algorithm, the results may vary between different runs.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the exact minimum value using calculus. To find the minimum value of f(x), we can find the first derivative of the function and set it equal to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 5\n\nSetting f'(x) = 0:\n\n2x + 5 = 0\nx = -5/2 = -2.5\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging x = -2.5 back into the original function:\n\nf(-2.5) = (-2.5)^2 + 5(-2.5) - 6 = 6.25 - 12.5 - 6 = -12.25\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 5x - 6 in the interval [-10, 10] is -12.25, and the corresponding value of x is -2.5."
