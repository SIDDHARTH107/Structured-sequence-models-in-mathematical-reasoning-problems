    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, which have a profit margin of $4 and $6 respectively. The production of each product requires two resources, labor and material, and the total amount of available resources is limited to 20 labor-hours and 30 units of material. It takes 3 labor-hours to produce one unit of A and 4 labor-hours to produce one unit of B. Also, one unit of A requires 2 units of material, and one unit of B requires 3 units of material. What is the maximum profit the company can make if they want to produce at least 4 units of product A?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe profit function is P(x, y) = 4x + 6y.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n1. 3x + 4y ≤ 20 (labor-hours constraint)\n2. 2x + 3y ≤ 30 (material constraint)\n3. x ≥ 4 (minimum production of product A)\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by solving the constraints:\n\n1. y ≤ (20 - 3x) / 4\n2. y ≤ (30 - 2x) / 3\n3. x ≥ 4\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the constraints simultaneously:\n\nVertex 1: x = 4, y = (20 - 3 * 4) / 4 = 2\nVertex 2: x = 4, y = (30 - 2 * 4) / 3 = 6\nVertex 3: x = 6, y = (30 - 2 * 6) / 3 = 4\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(4, 2) = 4 * 4 + 6 * 2 = 28\nP(4, 6) = 4 * 4 + 6 * 6 = 52\nP(6, 4) = 4 * 6 + 6 * 4 = 48\n\nThe maximum profit is $52 when the company produces 4 units of product A and 6 units of product B."
