    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface S. \n\n1. Compute the tangent vectors:\nLet's compute the partial derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to u and v.\n\n∂x/∂u = 2u\n∂x/∂v = 2v\n∂y/∂u = 1\n∂y/∂v = -1\n∂z/∂u = 3u^2\n∂z/∂v = -3v^2\n\nNow, we have the tangent vectors:\nT_u = (2u, 1, 3u^2)\nT_v = (2v, -1, -3v^2)\n\n2. Compute the first fundamental form:\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n[ I  II ]\n[ II III ]\n\nwhere \nI = <T_u, T_u>\nII = <T_u, T_v>\nIII = <T_v, T_v>\n\nAt the point (1, 0, -1), we have u = 1 and v = 0. So, the tangent vectors at this point are:\nT_u = (2, 1, 3)\nT_v = (0, -1, 0)\n\nNow, we can compute the first fundamental form:\nI = <T_u, T_u> = (2)^2 + (1)^2 + (3)^2 = 14\nII = <T_u, T_v> = 2*0 + 1*(-1) + 3*0 = -1\nIII = <T_v, T_v> = (0)^2 + (-1)^2 + (0)^2 = 1\n\nSo, the first fundamental form is:\n[ 14 -1 ]\n[ -1  1 ]\n\n3. Compute the second fundamental form:\nTo compute the second fundamental form, we need the second partial derivatives of the parametric equations:\n\n∂²x/∂u² = 2\n∂²x/∂v² = 2\n∂²x/∂u∂v = 0\n∂²y/∂u² = 0\n∂²y/∂v² = 0\n∂²y/∂u∂v = 0\n∂²z/∂u² = 6u\n∂²z/∂v² = -6v\n∂²z/∂u∂v = 0\n\nAt the point (1, 0, -1), we have u = 1 and v = 0. So, the second partial derivatives at this point are:\n∂²x/∂u² = 2\n∂²x/∂v² = 2\n∂²x/∂u∂v = 0\n∂²y/∂u² = 0\n∂²y/∂v² = 0\n∂²y/∂u∂v = 0\n∂²z/∂u² = 6\n∂²z/∂v² = 0\n∂²z/∂u∂v = 0\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form:\nL = <N, ∂²x/∂u², ∂²y/∂u², ∂²z/∂u²> = 2\nM = <N, ∂²x/∂u∂v, ∂²y/∂u∂v, ∂²z/∂u∂v> = 0\nN = <N, ∂²x/∂v², ∂²y/∂v², ∂²z/∂v²> = 2\n\nSo, the second fundamental form is:\n[ 2  0 ]\n[ 0  2 ]\n\n4. Compute the principal curvatures:\nThe principal curvatures k1 and k2 are the eigenvalues of the matrix product (Second fundamental form)^(-1) * (First fundamental form). In this case, both matrices are diagonal, so the product is also diagonal, and the eigenvalues are simply the ratios of the diagonal elements:\n\nk1 = L/I = 2/14 = 1/7\nk2 = N/III = 2/1 = 2\n\nSo, the principal curvatures of the surface S at the point (1, 0, -1) are k1 = 1/7 and k2 = 2."
