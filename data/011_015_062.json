    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle and the concept of Ramsey numbers. The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the minimum number of vertices in a graph such that there is either a clique of size m (m mutual friends) or an independent set of size n (n mutual strangers).\n\nIn this case, we want to find the minimum number of connections needed to guarantee that there are either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers, which corresponds to finding the Ramsey number R(3, 3).\n\nWe can construct a graph with 6 vertices, representing the 6 people. Each edge between two vertices can be colored either red (representing friendship) or blue (representing strangers).\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario, where we try to avoid creating a red triangle (3 mutual friends) or a blue triangle (3 mutual strangers) for as long as possible.\n\n1. Pick a vertex, say A. There are 5 edges connected to A, and we can color 2 of them red and 3 of them blue without creating a red or blue triangle.\n\n2. Now, consider the two vertices connected to A by red edges, say B and C. If there is a red edge between B and C, we have a red triangle (A, B, C). If there is a blue edge between B and C, we have a blue triangle (B, C, and one of the vertices connected to A by a blue edge).\n\nThus, in the worst-case scenario, we need at least 6 vertices to guarantee that there are either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers. Therefore, the minimum number of connections needed is the number of edges in a complete graph with 6 vertices, which is given by the formula:\n\nEdges = (6 * (6 - 1)) / 2 = (6 * 5) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15\n\nSo, the minimum number of connections needed is 15."
