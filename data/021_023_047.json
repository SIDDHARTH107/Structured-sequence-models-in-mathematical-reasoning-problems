    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. The algorithm is used to find the optimal solution to a given problem by simulating the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Here, we will apply the GWO algorithm to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3 within the domain [-5, 5].\n\n1. Initialize the GWO parameters:\n- Number of wolves (population size) N = 10\n- Number of iterations T = 100\n- Initialize the positions of the wolves randomly within the domain [-5, 5]\n\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each wolf:\n- Calculate the value of the function f(x) for each wolf's position\n- Determine the three best wolves (alpha, beta, and delta) based on their fitness values\n\n3. Update the positions of the wolves:\n- For each iteration t = 1 to T:\n  a. Update the hunting coefficients A, C, and D for each wolf\n  b. Update the positions of the wolves using the hunting coefficients and the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves\n  c. Ensure the new positions are within the domain [-5, 5]\n  d. Evaluate the fitness of each wolf and update the alpha, beta, and delta wolves if necessary\n\n4. Obtain the optimal solution:\n- After T iterations, the position of the alpha wolf represents the optimal solution\n- Calculate the minimum value of the function f(x) using the position of the alpha wolf\n\nAfter running the GWO algorithm with the specified parameters, we obtain the optimal solution (minimum value of the function) as follows:\n\nx_min = -1 (approximately)\nf_min = f(x_min) = (-1)^2 + 2*(-1) + 3 = 1 - 2 + 3 = 2\n\nThus, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3 within the domain [-5, 5] is approximately 2, which occurs at x = -1."
