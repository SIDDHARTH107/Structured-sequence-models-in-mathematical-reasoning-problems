How many total turns are made by the Hilbert curve of order 5?",
    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve of order n is a space-filling curve that consists of 4^(n) line segments. Each iteration of the curve adds three turns for each of the previous turns, plus an additional three turns for the new connections between the smaller curves.\n\nLet T(n) represent the total number of turns in the Hilbert curve of order n. We can express this as a recursive formula:\n\nT(n) = 3 * T(n-1) + 3, with T(1) = 3.\n\nNow, we can find T(5) by calculating the total number of turns for each order up to 5:\n\nT(1) = 3\nT(2) = 3 * T(1) + 3 = 3 * 3 + 3 = 12\nT(3) = 3 * T(2) + 3 = 3 * 12 + 3 = 39\nT(4) = 3 * T(3) + 3 = 3 * 39 + 3 = 120\nT(5) = 3 * T(4) + 3 = 3 * 120 + 3 = 363\n\nSo, the total number of turns made by the Hilbert curve of order 5 is 363."
