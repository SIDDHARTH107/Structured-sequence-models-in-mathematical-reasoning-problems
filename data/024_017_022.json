    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of a vector V = [3, 4] along the helix r(t) = [cos(t), sin(t), t/2] for t in the range [0, 2π], we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the helix at each point t.\n\nThe tangent vector T(t) is the derivative of the position vector r(t) with respect to t:\n\nT(t) = r'(t) = [-sin(t), cos(t), 1/2]\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of V along the helix. The parallel transport of a vector is obtained by keeping the angle between the vector and the tangent vector constant as it moves along the curve. To do this, we can use the Gram-Schmidt process to project V onto the plane perpendicular to T(t) at each point t.\n\nLet W(t) be the projection of V onto the plane perpendicular to T(t). Then,\n\nW(t) = V - (V · T(t)) * T(t)\n\nwhere \"·\" denotes the dot product.\n\nNow, let's compute W(t):\n\nV · T(t) = [3, 4] · [-sin(t), cos(t), 1/2] = -3sin(t) + 4cos(t) + 2\n\nW(t) = [3, 4] - (-3sin(t) + 4cos(t) + 2) * [-sin(t), cos(t), 1/2]\n     = [3 + 3sin(t)(-3sin(t) + 4cos(t) + 2), 4 - cos(t)(-3sin(t) + 4cos(t) + 2), -1/2(-3sin(t) + 4cos(t) + 2)]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate W(t) at the end of the curve, t = 2π:\n\nW(2π) = [3 + 3sin(2π)(-3sin(2π) + 4cos(2π) + 2), 4 - cos(2π)(-3sin(2π) + 4cos(2π) + 2), -1/2(-3sin(2π) + 4cos(2π) + 2)]\n      = [3, 4, -1]\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector V = [3, 4] along the helix r(t) = [cos(t), sin(t), t/2] from t = 0 to t = 2π is W(2π) = [3, 4, -1]."
