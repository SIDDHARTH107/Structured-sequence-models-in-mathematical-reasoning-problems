    "message_2": "The Mackey-Glass equation is a nonlinear delay differential equation given by:\n\ndx(t)/dt = βx(t-τ) / (1 + x(t-τ)^n) - αx(t)\n\nwhere x(t) is the variable of interest, β, α, and γ are parameters, τ is the time delay, and n is the exponent.\n\nIn this case, we are given β = 0.1, τ = 15, α = 0.2, and γ = 1.0. To find the equilibrium value, we need to find the value of x(t) when dx(t)/dt = 0.\n\n0 = 0.1x(t-15) / (1 + x(t-15)^1) - 0.2x(t)\n\nSince we are looking for the equilibrium value, we can assume that x(t) = x(t-15) = x_eq. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = 0.1x_eq / (1 + x_eq) - 0.2x_eq\n\nNow, we need to solve for x_eq:\n\n0.1x_eq = 0.2x_eq(1 + x_eq)\n\n0.1x_eq = 0.2x_eq + 0.2x_eq^2\n\n0 = 0.2x_eq^2 + 0.1x_eq\n\nx_eq(0.2x_eq + 0.1) = 0\n\nFrom this equation, we have two possible solutions for x_eq:\n\n1) x_eq = 0\n2) 0.2x_eq + 0.1 = 0\n\nFor the second solution:\n\n0.2x_eq = -0.1\nx_eq = -0.1 / 0.2\nx_eq = -0.5\n\nHowever, since the Mackey-Glass equation models physiological systems, a negative equilibrium value does not make sense in this context. Therefore, the equilibrium value of the Mackey-Glass equation for the given parameters is x_eq = 0."
