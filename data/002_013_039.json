    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base that measures 8 cm by 10 cm, and a height of 12 cm. What is the volume of this pyramid?",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\n\nThe base area of the pyramid is the area of the rectangle, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nBase_area = length * width\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm and the width is 10 cm, so the base area is:\n\nBase_area = 8 cm * 10 cm = 80 cm²\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the pyramid using the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * base_area * height\nVolume = (1/3) * 80 cm² * 12 cm\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 960 cm³\nVolume = 320 cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 320 cubic centimeters."
