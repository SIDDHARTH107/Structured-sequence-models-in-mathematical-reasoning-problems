    "message_2": "To find the hypotenuse of the right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, the adjacent side (a) has a length of 6 cm and the opposite side (b) has a length of 8 cm.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem formula is: c² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the given values:\nc² = (6 cm)² + (8 cm)²\nc² = 36 cm² + 64 cm²\nc² = 100 cm²\n\nNow, find the square root of both sides to get the length of the hypotenuse (c):\nc = √100 cm²\nc = 10 cm\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm.\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the triangle, simply add the lengths of all three sides:\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 6 cm + 8 cm + 10 cm\nPerimeter = 24 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 24 cm."
