    "message_2": "Let's first recall the Schwarz reflection principle. If a holomorphic function is defined on a domain symmetric with respect to the real axis and takes real values on the real axis, then it can be analytically continued to the symmetric domain with respect to the real axis.\n\nNow, let's define a new function $g(z) = f(z)f(4-z)$. Notice that $g(z)$ is holomorphic in the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$, and $|g(z)| \\leq 1$ since $|f(z)| \\leq 1$ and $|f(4-z)| \\leq 1$.\n\nMoreover, for $z \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $g(z) = f(z)f(4-z) \\in \\mathbb{R}$, since $f(z)$ and $f(4-z)$ are complex conjugates of each other. Therefore, by the Schwarz reflection principle, we can analytically continue $g(z)$ to the lower half-plane $\\mathbb{H}^-$, and we still have $|g(z)| \\leq 1$.\n\nNow, consider the function $h(z) = g(z) - f(2+3i)f(2-3i)$. This function is holomorphic in the whole complex plane, and $|h(z)| \\leq 1 + |f(2+3i)f(2-3i)|$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$. By Liouville's theorem, since $h(z)$ is entire and bounded, it must be constant. Therefore, $h(z) = c$ for some constant $c$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate $h(2)$. We have $h(2) = g(2) - f(2+3i)f(2-3i) = f(2)^2 - f(2+3i)f(2-3i) = c$. Since $|f(2)| \\leq 1$, we have $|c| \\leq 1$.\n\nFinally, let's evaluate $h(4)$. We have $h(4) = g(4) - f(2+3i)f(2-3i) = f(4)^2 - f(2+3i)f(2-3i) = c$. Since $|f(4)| \\leq 1$, we have $|c| \\leq 1$.\n\nThus, we have $|f(2+3i)f(2-3i)| \\leq 1 + |c| \\leq 2$. Since $|f(2+3i)| = |f(2-3i)|$, we have $|f(2+3i)|^2 \\leq 2$, which implies $|f(2+3i)| \\leq \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $|f(2+3i)|$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}$."
