The theorem states that any continuous function from a compact, convex, and non-empty subset of a Euclidean space to itself has a fixed point.\n\nFirst, we need to show that X is a compact, convex, and non-empty subset of a Euclidean space. Since X is a compact metric space, it is also compact in the Euclidean space. As a non-empty metric space, X is non-empty in the Euclidean space as well. To show that X is convex, we need to show that for any two points x, y ∈ X, the line segment connecting x and y is entirely contained in X. Since X is a metric space, the distance between any two points x and y is given by d(x, y). Let z be any point on the line segment connecting x and y. Then, we can write z as a convex combination of x and y:\n\nz = (1 - t)x + ty, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.\n\nNow, we need to show that d(z, X) = 0, which means that z ∈ X. Since X is a metric space, it is also a topological space with the metric topology induced by the distance function d. As X is compact, it is also complete and totally bounded. Therefore, for any ε > 0, there exists a finite ε-net N = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n} such that for any point x ∈ X, there exists a point x_i ∈ N with d(x, x_i) < ε. In particular, for z, there exists a point x_i ∈ N with d(z, x_i) < ε. Since x_i ∈ X and ε can be chosen arbitrarily small, we have d(z, X) = 0, which implies that z ∈ X. Thus, X is convex.\n\nNow, we can apply the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem to the continuous function f: X → X. By the theorem, there exists a point x ∈ X such that f(x) = x."
