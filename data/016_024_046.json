    "message_2": "A Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively subdividing a square into nine smaller squares and removing the central square at each iteration. In the 5th iteration, the total number of squares can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal number of squares = (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nTotal number of squares = (8^5 - 1) / 7\nTotal number of squares = (32768 - 1) / 7\nTotal number of squares = 32767 / 7\nTotal number of squares = 4681\n\nSo, there are 4681 squares in the 5th iteration of a Sierpinski carpet if the initial figure consists of only one square."
