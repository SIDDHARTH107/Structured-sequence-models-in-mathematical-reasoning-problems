    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that is created through a series of iterations. With each iteration, the length of the curve increases. \n\nFor the Gosper curve, the length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (previous length) * (7^(1/2))\n\nAfter the first iteration, the length of the curve is:\n\nLength = 1 * (7^(1/2)) = 7^(1/2)\n\nAfter the second iteration, the length of the curve is:\n\nLength = (7^(1/2)) * (7^(1/2)) = 7\n\nAfter the third iteration, the length of the curve is:\n\nLength = 7 * (7^(1/2)) = 7^(3/2)\n\nAfter the fourth iteration, the length of the curve is:\n\nLength = (7^(3/2)) * (7^(1/2)) = 7^2 = 49\n\nSo, the length of the Gosper curve after undergoing four iterations with an initial line segment of 1 unit is 49 units."
