    "message_1": "Let f(z) = z^2-2z+2 be a complex function defined on the unit disk D ={z in C: |z|<1}. Apply the Riemann mapping theorem to find a biholomorphism from D to the interior of the unit circle that transforms f(z) into the function g(z) = z^2. Determine the image of the point 2-i under this biholomorphism.",
    "message_2": "To find a biholomorphism from D to the interior of the unit circle that transforms f(z) into g(z) = z^2, we first need to find a Möbius transformation that maps the critical points of f(z) to the critical points of g(z). The critical points of a function are the points where the derivative is zero.\n\nThe derivative of f(z) is f'(z) = 2z - 2. Setting f'(z) = 0, we get z = 1. The critical point of f(z) is z = 1.\n\nThe derivative of g(z) is g'(z) = 2z. Setting g'(z) = 0, we get z = 0. The critical point of g(z) is z = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find a Möbius transformation T(z) that maps 1 to 0. A Möbius transformation has the form T(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d), where a, b, c, and d are complex numbers and ad - bc ≠ 0.\n\nSince T(1) = 0, we have (a + b) / (c + d) = 0. This implies a + b = 0, so b = -a.\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of the Möbius transformation T^(-1)(z). Using the formula for the inverse of a Möbius transformation, we have T^(-1)(z) = (dz - b) / (-cz + a).\n\nNow, we can find the biholomorphism h(z) = T^(-1)(g(T(z))). Plugging in the expressions for T(z) and g(z), we get:\n\nh(z) = T^(-1)(g(T(z))) = T^(-1)((az - a)^2) = (d(az - a)^2 + a) / (-c(az - a)^2 + a).\n\nNow, we want to find the image of the point 2 - i under this biholomorphism. Plugging in z = 2 - i into h(z), we get:\n\nh(2 - i) = (d(2 - i - a)^2 + a) / (-c(2 - i - a)^2 + a).\n\nTo find the exact expression for h(2 - i), we need to determine the values of a, c, and d. However, the Riemann mapping theorem only guarantees the existence of such a biholomorphism, and finding the exact expression might be difficult. Nevertheless, we have shown the general form of the biholomorphism and how to find the image of a point under it."
