    "message_2": "To find the fractal dimension of the Lévy C curve, we can use the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the fractal dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the Lévy C curve, each straight line segment of length 1/3 is replaced by two line segments of the same length. So, N = 2.\n\nThe scaling factor, s, is the ratio of the original length to the length of the new segments. In this case, the original length is 1, and the new segments have a length of 1/3. So, s = 1 / (1/3) = 3.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nD ≈ 0.6309\n\nSo, the fractal dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 0.6309."
