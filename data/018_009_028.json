    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product of A × (B × A) and (A × B) × A, we first need to find the Cartesian products B × A and A × B.\n\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian products A × (B × A) and (A × B) × A.\n\nA × (B × A) = {(1, (3, 1)), (1, (3, 2)), (1, (4, 1)), (1, (4, 2)), (2, (3, 1)), (2, (3, 2)), (2, (4, 1)), (2, (4, 2))}\n\n(A × B) × A = {((1, 3), 1), ((1, 3), 2), ((1, 4), 1), ((1, 4), 2), ((2, 3), 1), ((2, 3), 2), ((2, 4), 1), ((2, 4), 2)}\n\nNow, we need to prove that these two sets are equal. To do this, we can show that every element in A × (B × A) has a corresponding element in (A × B) × A and vice versa.\n\nLet's rewrite the elements of (A × B) × A in the same format as the elements of A × (B × A):\n\n{((1, 3), 1) → (1, (3, 1)), ((1, 3), 2) → (1, (3, 2)), ((1, 4), 1) → (1, (4, 1)), ((1, 4), 2) → (1, (4, 2)), ((2, 3), 1) → (2, (3, 1)), ((2, 3), 2) → (2, (3, 2)), ((2, 4), 1) → (2, (4, 1)), ((2, 4), 2) → (2, (4, 2))}\n\nNow, the sets A × (B × A) and (A × B) × A look like this:\n\nA × (B × A) = {(1, (3, 1)), (1, (3, 2)), (1, (4, 1)), (1, (4, 2)), (2, (3, 1)), (2, (3, 2)), (2, (4, 1)), (2, (4, 2))}\n\n(A × B) × A = {(1, (3, 1)), (1, (3, 2)), (1, (4, 1)), (1, (4, 2)), (2, (3, 1)), (2, (3, 2)), (2, (4, 1)), (2, (4, 2))}\n\nAs we can see, both sets have the same elements, which means they are equal. Therefore, A × (B × A) = (A × B) × A."
