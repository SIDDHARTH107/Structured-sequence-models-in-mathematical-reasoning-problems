    "message_2": "Unfortunately, I cannot see the specific graph you are referring to. However, I can provide you with a general approach to find the minimum sized vertex cover for a graph.\n\n1. Identify all the edges in the graph.\n2. Choose a vertex that has the highest degree (i.e., connected to the most edges).\n3. Add that vertex to the vertex cover set.\n4. Remove all the edges connected to that vertex from the graph.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until there are no more edges left in the graph.\n\nThe set of vertices you have collected during this process will be the minimum sized vertex cover for the graph. Note that this is a greedy algorithm and may not always produce the optimal solution, but it usually provides a good approximation."
