    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common factors in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: $4x^2 - 12x = 4x(x - 3)$\n\nDenominator: $2x^2 - 8x = 2x(x - 4)$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the rational expression as:\n\n$\\frac{4x(x - 3)}{2x(x - 4)}$\n\nNext, we can cancel out the common factors in the numerator and the denominator. In this case, the common factor is $2x$.\n\n$\\frac{4x(x - 3)}{2x(x - 4)} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 2x(x - 3)}{2 \\cdot x(x - 4)} = \\frac{2(x - 3)}{(x - 4)}$\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n$\\frac{2(x - 3)}{(x - 4)}$"
