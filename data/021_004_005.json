    "message_2": "a) Forward finite difference formula for f'(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nLet x = 0.5 and h = 0.1. We need to find f(0.5), f(0.6):\n\nf(0.5) = (0.5)^3 - 2(0.5)^2 + 0.5 + 1 = 0.125 - 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 1.125\nf(0.6) = (0.6)^3 - 2(0.6)^2 + 0.6 + 1 = 0.216 - 0.72 + 0.6 + 1 = 1.096\n\nNow, we can estimate f'(0.5) using the forward finite difference formula:\n\nf'(0.5) ≈ (f(0.6) - f(0.5)) / 0.1 = (1.096 - 1.125) / 0.1 = -0.29\n\nb) Backward finite difference formula for f'(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x) - f(x - h)) / h\n\nLet x = 0.5 and h = 0.1. We need to find f(0.4):\n\nf(0.4) = (0.4)^3 - 2(0.4)^2 + 0.4 + 1 = 0.064 - 0.32 + 0.4 + 1 = 1.144\n\nNow, we can estimate f'(0.5) using the backward finite difference formula:\n\nf'(0.5) ≈ (f(0.5) - f(0.4)) / 0.1 = (1.125 - 1.144) / 0.1 = -0.19\n\nc) Centered difference formula for f''(x) is given by:\n\nf''(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - 2f(x) + f(x - h)) / h^2\n\nLet x = 0.5 and h = 0.1. We already have f(0.5), f(0.4), and f(0.6):\n\nf''(0.5) ≈ (f(0.6) - 2f(0.5) + f(0.4)) / (0.1)^2 = (1.096 - 2(1.125) + 1.144) / 0.01 = -2.9\n\nd) To estimate the definite integral of f(x) over the interval [0,1] using the trapezoidal method with n = 4, we need to find the values of f(x) at the equally spaced points in the interval:\n\nx0 = 0, x1 = 0.25, x2 = 0.5, x3 = 0.75, x4 = 1\n\nf(0) = 1\nf(0.25) = (0.25)^3 - 2(0.25)^2 + 0.25 + 1 = 1.015625\nf(0.5) = 1.125 (already calculated)\nf(0.75) = (0.75)^3 - 2(0.75)^2 + 0.75 + 1 = 0.421875\nf(1) = 1^3 - 2(1)^2 + 1 + 1 = 1\n\nNow, we can use the trapezoidal method formula:\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ (h/2) * (f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 2f(x3) + f(x4))\n\nh = (1 - 0) / 4 = 0.25\n\n∫f(x)dx ≈ (0.25/2) * (1 + 2(1.015625) + 2(1.125) + 2(0.421875) + 1) = 0.125 * (7.075) = 0.884375\n\nSo, the estimated definite integral of f(x) over the interval [0,1] using the trapezoidal method with n = 4 is 0.884375."
