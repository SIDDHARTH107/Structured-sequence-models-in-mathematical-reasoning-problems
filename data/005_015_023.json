Use hierarchical clustering with complete linkage to identify the clusters in the data. Display the results using a dendrogram.",
    "message_2": "To perform hierarchical clustering with complete linkage, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the distance matrix for all data points.\n2. Merge the two closest data points/clusters.\n3. Update the distance matrix.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until only one cluster remains.\n\nLet's start by calculating the Euclidean distance between all pairs of data points:\n\n|   | (1,3) | (2,4) | (3,5) | (8,6) | (9,7) |\n|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|(1,3)|  0.0  |  1.41 |  2.83 |  7.21 |  8.60 |\n|(2,4)| 1.41 |  0.0  |  1.41 |  6.08 |  7.21 |\n|(3,5)| 2.83 |  1.41 |  0.0  |  5.00 |  6.08 |\n|(8,6)| 7.21 |  6.08 |  5.00 |  0.0  |  1.41 |\n|(9,7)| 8.60 |  7.21 |  6.08 |  1.41 |  0.0  |\n\nNow, let's perform the clustering:\n\n1. Merge the closest pair of points, which are (2,4) and (3,5) with a distance of 1.41. We now have four clusters: {(1,3)}, {(2,4), (3,5)}, {(8,6)}, and {(9,7)}.\n2. Update the distance matrix:\n\n|   | (1,3) | {(2,4), (3,5)} | (8,6) | (9,7) |\n|---|-------|---------------|-------|-------|\n|(1,3)|  0.0  |      2.83     |  7.21 |  8.60 |\n|{(2,4), (3,5)}| 2.83 |      0.0      |  5.00 |  6.08 |\n|(8,6)| 7.21 |      5.00     |  0.0  |  1.41 |\n|(9,7)| 8.60 |      6.08     |  1.41 |  0.0  |\n\n3. Merge the next closest pair of points, which are (8,6) and (9,7) with a distance of 1.41. We now have three clusters: {(1,3)}, {(2,4), (3,5)}, and {(8,6), (9,7)}.\n4. Update the distance matrix:\n\n|   | (1,3) | {(2,4), (3,5)} | {(8,6), (9,7)} |\n|---|-------|---------------|---------------|\n|(1,3)|  0.0  |      2.83     |      8.60     |\n|{(2,4), (3,5)}| 2.83 |      0.0      |      6.08     |\n|{(8,6), (9,7)}| 8.60 |      6.08     |      0.0      |\n\n5. Merge the next closest pair of clusters, which are {(1,3)} and {(2,4), (3,5)} with a distance of 2.83. We now have two clusters: {(1,3), (2,4), (3,5)} and {(8,6), (9,7)}.\n6. Finally, merge the last two clusters with a distance of 6.08.\n\nThe final dendrogram would look like this:\n\n```\n       +---(1,3)\n       |\n   +---+---(2,4)\n   |   |\n   |   +---(3,5)\n---+\n   |   +---(8,6)\n   |\n   +---+---(9,7)\n```\n\nSo, the hierarchical clustering with complete linkage results in the following clusters: {(1,3), (2,4), (3,5)} and {(8,6), (9,7)}."
