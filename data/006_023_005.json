    "message_1": "Suppose that in a market of 500 consumers, 80% prefer to buy products online and 20% prefer to buy products in physical stores. If a company wants to launch a new product in this market, what is the probability that at least 100 consumers will buy the product online?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 100 consumers will buy the product online, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, k consumers buying the product online)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, the total number of consumers, which is 500)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of consumers buying the product online)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a consumer preferring to buy products online, which is 80% or 0.8)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a consumer preferring to buy products in physical stores, which is 20% or 0.2)\n\nSince we want to find the probability that at least 100 consumers will buy the product online, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 100, 101, 102, ..., 500.\n\nP(X >= 100) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 100 to 500\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.\n\nP(X >= 100) = 1 - P(X < 100)\n\nIn this case, the event \"not occurring\" is less than 100 consumers buying the product online. So, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 99.\n\nP(X >= 100) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 99\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum using the binomial probability formula for each value of k and subtract it from 1. However, this calculation is still quite complex and would typically be done using statistical software or a calculator with a built-in binomial probability function.\n\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that:\n\nP(X >= 100) ≈ 1 - 1.110223e-16 ≈ 1\n\nThe probability that at least 100 consumers will buy the product online is approximately 1, or 100%. This result makes sense, as with 80% of the consumers preferring to buy products online, it is highly likely that at least 100 out of 500 consumers will buy the product online."
