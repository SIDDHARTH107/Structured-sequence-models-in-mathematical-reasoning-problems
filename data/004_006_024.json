    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5, we first need to find its first derivative, f'(x), and then set it equal to zero to solve for the critical points.\n\nThe first derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first divide by 3 to simplify:\n\n0 = x^2 - 4x + 3\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic:\n\n0 = (x - 3)(x - 1)\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we find the critical points:\n\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 5 are x = 1 and x = 3."
