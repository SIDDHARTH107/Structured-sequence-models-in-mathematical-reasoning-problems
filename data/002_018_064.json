    "message_2": "To find the volume of the inscribed sphere, we first need to determine the diameter of the sphere, which is equal to the side length of the cube. \n\nSince the volume of the cube is 64 cubic centimeters, we can find the side length by taking the cube root of the volume:\n\nSide length = ∛(64) = 4 cm\n\nNow that we have the side length of the cube, we know that the diameter of the inscribed sphere is also 4 cm. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half of the diameter:\n\nRadius = Diameter / 2 = 4 cm / 2 = 2 cm\n\nNow we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is:\n\nVolume = (4/3)πr³\n\nSubstitute the radius (r = 2 cm) into the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(2)³\n\nVolume = (4/3)π(8)\n\nVolume ≈ 33.51 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the inscribed sphere is approximately 33.51 cubic centimeters, rounded to the nearest hundredth."
