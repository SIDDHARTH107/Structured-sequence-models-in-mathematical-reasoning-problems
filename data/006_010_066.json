    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, affected individuals) in n trials (in this case, 1,000 individuals)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the prevalence rate of 2% or 0.02)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, not being affected by the disease)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 1,000 individuals)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 15 affected individuals)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 15) = (1000C15) * (0.02^15) * (0.98^985)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 1000C15:\n\n1000C15 = 1000! / (15!(1000-15)!)\n= 1000! / (15! * 985!)\n= 4.03193 * 10^21 (approximately, using a calculator or software)\n\nNow, let's calculate 0.02^15:\n\n0.02^15 = 3.2768 * 10^-23 (approximately)\n\nAnd finally, let's calculate 0.98^985:\n\n0.98^985 = 1.88345 * 10^-7 (approximately)\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 15) = (4.03193 * 10^21) * (3.2768 * 10^-23) * (1.88345 * 10^-7)\n= 0.0251 (approximately)\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 15 out of 1,000 individuals in this demographic group will be affected by the disease is approximately 2.51%."
