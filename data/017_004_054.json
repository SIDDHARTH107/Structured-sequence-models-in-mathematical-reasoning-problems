    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 5^2 = 25. We will prove that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nBy the Sylow Theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 25\n\nThe possible values for n_5 are 1 and 5. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup, which is normal in G. Let H be this normal 5-Sylow subgroup. Since the order of H is 5, H is cyclic, say H = ⟨a⟩, where a has order 5.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of H is 5, the order of G/H is 25/5 = 5. Thus, G/H is cyclic, say G/H = ⟨bH⟩, where b has order 5 in G/H.\n\nSince H is normal in G, we can apply the Correspondence Theorem to find an element c in G such that cH = bH. Then, the order of c in G is 5. Now, consider the subgroup K = ⟨c⟩. Since the orders of a and c are both 5 and gcd(5, 5) = 1, the elements a and c commute, i.e., ac = ca.\n\nNow, we have two cyclic subgroups H = ⟨a⟩ and K = ⟨c⟩ of order 5, and their intersection is trivial (since their orders are prime). Moreover, the product of their orders is equal to the order of G, i.e., |H||K| = |G|. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and K, i.e., G ≅ H × K, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIf n_5 = 5, then there are 5 distinct 5-Sylow subgroups in G. However, since the order of G is 25, this would imply that there are at least 5 * 4 = 20 elements of order 5 in G, which is a contradiction since there can be at most 24 non-identity elements in G. Thus, n_5 cannot be 5.\n\nTherefore, every group of order 5^2 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
