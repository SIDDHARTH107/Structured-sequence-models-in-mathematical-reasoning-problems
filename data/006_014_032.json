    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one technological failure in a 30-day month, we can first find the probability of having no technological failures and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of not having a technological failure on any given day is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nThe probability of not having a technological failure for 30 consecutive days is 0.95^30 ≈ 0.214.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least one technological failure by subtracting the probability of not having any failures from 1:\n\n1 - 0.214 ≈ 0.786.\n\nSo, the probability of having at least one technological failure in a 30-day month is approximately 0.786 or 78.6%."
