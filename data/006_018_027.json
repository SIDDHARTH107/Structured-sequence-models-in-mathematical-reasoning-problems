    "message_1": "A financial firm has identified that the probability of a certain type of fraud occurring on any given day is 0.02. If the firm operates 250 business days in a year, what is the probability that the fraud will occur at least once during the year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability of the fraud occurring at least once, we will find the probability of the fraud not occurring at all during the year and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of the fraud not occurring on any given day is 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.\n\nFor the fraud not to occur during the entire year (250 business days), this probability must hold true for all 250 days. So, we will raise 0.98 to the power of 250:\n\n(0.98)^250 ≈ 0.0183\n\nNow, we will find the complementary probability, which is the probability of the fraud occurring at least once during the year:\n\n1 - 0.0183 ≈ 0.9817\n\nSo, the probability that the fraud will occur at least once during the year is approximately 0.9817 or 98.17%."
