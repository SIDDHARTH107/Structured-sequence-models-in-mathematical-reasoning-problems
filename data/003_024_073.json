    "message_2": "To find the length of the projection of the 120 cm long vector onto the 150 cm long vector, we can use the formula for the scalar projection of one vector onto another:\n\nprojection_length = |A| * cos(theta)\n\nwhere |A| is the magnitude of the 120 cm long vector, and theta is the angle between the two vectors.\n\nIn this case, |A| = 120 cm and theta = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\ntheta (in radians) = (60 degrees) * (pi / 180) = (1/3) * pi\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle:\n\ncos(theta) = cos((1/3) * pi) = 1/2\n\nFinally, we can calculate the projection length:\n\nprojection_length = |A| * cos(theta) = 120 cm * (1/2) = 60 cm\n\nSo, the length of the projection of the 120 cm long vector onto the 150 cm long vector is 60 cm."
