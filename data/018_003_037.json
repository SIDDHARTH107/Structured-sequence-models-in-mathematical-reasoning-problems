    "message_2": "A superset of a set is a set that contains all the elements of the original set, as well as possibly additional elements. In this case, we are looking for a superset of set A and a superset of set B.\n\nLet's first find the union of set A and set B. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either set. In this case, the union of set A and set B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's prove that the union of set A and set B is a superset of both sets A and B.\n\n1. A ⊆ A ∪ B: For every element x in set A, x is also in the union of set A and set B. This is true because the union contains all elements from both sets. Therefore, A ∪ B is a superset of set A.\n\n2. B ⊆ A ∪ B: For every element x in set B, x is also in the union of set A and set B. This is true because the union contains all elements from both sets. Therefore, A ∪ B is a superset of set B.\n\nSince A ∪ B is a superset of both sets A and B, we have proven that the union of set A and set B is a superset of both sets A and B."
