    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products: Product A and Product B. The profit margins for each unit of Product A and Product B are $10 and $15, respectively. The company has a limited production capacity of 500 units per day. The demand for Product A is at most 300 units per day while the demand for Product B is at most 200 units per day. What is the maximum profit per day that the company can obtain? Use global optimization methods to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced. The profit function can be represented as:\n\nProfit = 10x + 15y\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Production capacity constraint: x + y ≤ 500\n2. Demand constraint for Product A: x ≤ 300\n3. Demand constraint for Product B: y ≤ 200\n4. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nWe can use the linear programming method to solve this problem. The feasible region is defined by the intersection of these constraints. The vertices of the feasible region are:\n\nA. (0, 0)\nB. (300, 0)\nC. (300, 200)\nD. (200, 200)\nE. (0, 200)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nA. Profit(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\nB. Profit(300, 0) = 10(300) + 15(0) = $3000\nC. Profit(300, 200) = 10(300) + 15(200) = $9000\nD. Profit(200, 200) = 10(200) + 15(200) = $5000\nE. Profit(0, 200) = 10(0) + 15(200) = $3000\n\nThe maximum profit is obtained at vertex C, where the company produces 300 units of Product A and 200 units of Product B. The maximum profit per day is $9000."
