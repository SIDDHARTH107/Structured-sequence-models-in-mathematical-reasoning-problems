    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. In other words, it is the smallest number of colors needed to properly edge-color the graph.\n\nThe given graph is a complete graph with 5 vertices, denoted as K5. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The degree of each vertex in K5 is 4, as each vertex is connected to the other 4 vertices.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either equal to the maximum degree Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1. In this case, Δ(K5) = 4.\n\nNow, let's try to color the edges of the graph using 4 colors. We can start by coloring the edges of a cycle of length 5 (a pentagon) using 3 colors, say red, blue, and green. However, when we try to color the remaining edges (the diagonals), we find that we cannot do so without having two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nThus, we need to use Δ(K5) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 colors to properly edge-color the graph. Therefore, the chromatic index of the given graph is 5."
