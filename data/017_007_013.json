    "message_2": "To prove that there exists only one non-isomorphic group of order 6 up to isomorphism, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. A group of order 6 must have either a cyclic structure or a non-cyclic structure.\n2. If a group of order 6 is cyclic, it must be isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n3. If a group of order 6 is non-cyclic, it must have a different structure than the cyclic group C6.\n\nNow, let's consider a group G of order 6. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order 2) in G must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, say H. Since H is the only subgroup of order 2, it must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSimilarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (subgroups of order 3) in G must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 3-subgroup, say K. Since K is the only subgroup of order 3, it must be a normal subgroup of G.\n\nNow, since H and K are both normal subgroups of G, their product HK is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of H and K are relatively prime (2 and 3), we have |HK| = |H||K| = 6. Thus, HK = G.\n\nLet's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIn this case, G is generated by a single element, say g, of order 6. Thus, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C6.\n\nCase 2: G is non-cyclic.\nIn this case, G cannot be generated by a single element. Since G = HK, we can write any element of G as a product of elements from H and K. Let h be a non-identity element of H and k be a non-identity element of K. Then, h has order 2, k has order 3, and G contains at least the elements {e, h, k, k^2, hk, hk^2}, where e is the identity element.\n\nSince G has order 6, these six elements must be distinct, and G must be the set {e, h, k, k^2, hk, hk^2}. Moreover, we can verify that the group operation defined by the following multiplication table is well-defined and satisfies the group axioms:\n\n```\n   | e  h  k  k^2 hk hk^2\n---+---------------------\ne  | e  h  k  k^2 hk hk^2\nh  | h  e  hk hk^2 k  k^2\nk  | k  hk k^2 e  hk^2 h\nk^2| k^2 hk^2 e  k  h  hk\nhk | hk k^2 h  hk^2 k  e\nhk^2| hk^2 k  hk e  k^2 h\n```\n\nThis group is the dihedral group D3, which is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle.\n\nIn conclusion, there are only two possible groups of order 6 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C6 and the dihedral group D3. Since these two groups have different structures (cyclic vs. non-cyclic), they are not isomorphic to each other. Therefore, there exists only one non-isomorphic group of order 6 up to isomorphism, which is either isomorphic to C6 or D3 depending on whether the group is cyclic or non-cyclic."
