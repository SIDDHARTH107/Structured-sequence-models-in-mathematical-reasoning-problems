    "message_1": "Suppose you want to use the RSA encryption algorithm to encode a message to send to your friend. Your friend's public key is (e = 13, n = 143). If you want to encrypt the message M = 65, what will be the corresponding ciphertext C?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message M using the RSA encryption algorithm, we need to compute the ciphertext C using the formula:\n\nC ≡ M^e (mod n)\n\nIn this case, e = 13, n = 143, and M = 65. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nC ≡ 65^13 (mod 143)\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the method of exponentiation by squaring. First, let's find the binary representation of the exponent e:\n\n13 = 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 1101 (in binary)\n\nNow, let's compute the powers of M by squaring and reducing modulo n:\n\n65^1 (mod 143) = 65\n65^2 (mod 143) = 65 * 65 (mod 143) = 4225 (mod 143) = 34\n65^4 (mod 143) = 34 * 34 (mod 143) = 1156 (mod 143) = 20\n65^8 (mod 143) = 20 * 20 (mod 143) = 400 (mod 143) = 114\n\nNow, we can multiply the powers of M corresponding to the binary digits of e:\n\nC = 65^13 (mod 143) = 65^8 * 65^4 * 65^1 (mod 143)\nC = 114 * 20 * 65 (mod 143) = 147600 (mod 143) = 16\n\nSo, the ciphertext C is 16."
