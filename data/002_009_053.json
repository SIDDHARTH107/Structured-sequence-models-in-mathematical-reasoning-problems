    "message_1": "A cylinder has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm. What is the total surface area of the cylinder, rounded to the nearest square centimeter?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. In this case, the radius is 5 cm.\n\nArea of one circular base = π(5^2) = 25π square centimeters.\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is 2 * 25π = 50π square centimeters.\n\nNext, we need to find the lateral surface area. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height. In this case, the radius is 5 cm and the height is 10 cm.\n\nLateral surface area = 2π(5)(10) = 100π square centimeters.\n\nNow, we add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nTotal surface area = 50π + 100π = 150π square centimeters.\n\nTo round to the nearest square centimeter, we can use the approximation π ≈ 3.14:\n\nTotal surface area ≈ 150 * 3.14 = 471 square centimeters (rounded to the nearest square centimeter)."
