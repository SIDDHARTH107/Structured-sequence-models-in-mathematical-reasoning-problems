    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 35. Since 35 = 5 * 7, where 5 and 7 are distinct primes, we can apply the Sylow theorems to analyze the structure of G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_5, must divide 7 and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups, denoted by n_7, must divide 5 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is n_7 = 1.\n\nLet P be the unique 5-Sylow subgroup and Q be the unique 7-Sylow subgroup. Since both P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are coprime (5 and 7 are distinct primes), their intersection is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, consider the product of elements from P and Q. Since P and Q are normal in G, the product PQ is a subgroup of G. By the product formula for the orders of subgroups, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| / |P ∩ Q| = 5 * 7 / 1 = 35. Since |PQ| = |G|, we have PQ = G.\n\nThus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
