    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors v and w, we can use the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\nv • w = ||v|| ||w|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere v • w is the dot product of the vectors, ||v|| and ||w|| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the vectors v and w:\n\nv • w = (-4)(1) + (3)(5) = -4 + 15 = 11\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\n||v|| = √((-4)^2 + (3)^2) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n||w|| = √((1)^2 + (5)^2) = √(1 + 25) = √26\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n11 = 5 * √26 * cos(θ)\n\nTo find the cosine of the angle, we can divide both sides by the magnitudes of the vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = 11 / (5 * √26)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(11 / (5 * √26))\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees, we can use the following formula:\n\ndegrees = radians * (180 / π)\n\nθ ≈ 0.920 * (180 / π) ≈ 52.7 degrees\n\nSo, the angle between the two vectors v and w is approximately 52.7 degrees."
