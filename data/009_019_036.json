    "message_1": "Consider a stock price described by a stochastic differential equation:\n\ndS(t) = μS(t)dt + σS(t)dW(t)\n\nwhere S(t) is the stock price at time t, μ is the drift, σ is the volatility and W(t) is a Wiener process. Suppose a stock starts at a price of $100, μ = 0.1, σ = 0.4$ and the time period is t = 1 year. Calculate the expected value of the stock price after 1 year using the stochastic differential equation.",
    "message_2": "To find the expected value of the stock price after 1 year, we can use the solution to the stochastic differential equation (SDE) given by the geometric Brownian motion:\n\nS(t) = S(0) * exp((μ - (σ^2)/2) * t + σ * W(t))\n\nHere, S(0) is the initial stock price, which is $100. The drift μ is 0.1, the volatility σ is 0.4, and the time period t is 1 year. Since we want to find the expected value, we can take the expectation of both sides of the equation:\n\nE[S(t)] = E[S(0) * exp((μ - (σ^2)/2) * t + σ * W(t))]\n\nSince S(0) is a constant, it can be taken out of the expectation:\n\nE[S(t)] = S(0) * E[exp((μ - (σ^2)/2) * t + σ * W(t))]\n\nNow, we know that the expected value of the Wiener process W(t) is 0, and the expected value of the exponential term is given by:\n\nE[exp((μ - (σ^2)/2) * t + σ * W(t))] = exp((μ - (σ^2)/2) * t)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nE[S(t)] = 100 * exp((0.1 - (0.4^2)/2) * 1)\n\nE[S(t)] = 100 * exp((0.1 - 0.08) * 1)\n\nE[S(t)] = 100 * exp(0.02)\n\nE[S(t)] ≈ 100 * 1.0202\n\nE[S(t)] ≈ 102.02\n\nSo, the expected value of the stock price after 1 year is approximately $102.02."
