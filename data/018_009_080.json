    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A x B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA x B = {(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3), (6,1), (6,3)}\n\nNow let's find (A x B) x C. This is the set of all ordered pairs ((a, b), c) where (a, b) ∈ (A x B) and c ∈ C.\n\n(A x B) x C = {((2,1),0), ((2,3),0), ((4,1),0), ((4,3),0), ((6,1),0), ((6,3),0)}\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian product of B and C, denoted as B x C. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, c) where b ∈ B and c ∈ C.\n\nB x C = {(1,0), (3,0)}\n\nNow let's find A x (B x C). This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, (b, c)) where a ∈ A and (b, c) ∈ (B x C).\n\nA x (B x C) = {(2,(1,0)), (2,(3,0)), (4,(1,0)), (4,(3,0)), (6,(1,0)), (6,(3,0))}\n\nNow, let's verify if the Cartesian product is associative. To do this, we need to show that the elements in (A x B) x C can be mapped one-to-one to the elements in A x (B x C).\n\nWe can rewrite the elements of (A x B) x C as:\n\n{((2,1),0), ((2,3),0), ((4,1),0), ((4,3),0), ((6,1),0), ((6,3),0)}\n\nAnd we can rewrite the elements of A x (B x C) as:\n\n{(2,(1,0)), (2,(3,0)), (4,(1,0)), (4,(3,0)), (6,(1,0)), (6,(3,0))}\n\nWe can see that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of (A x B) x C and A x (B x C) by mapping ((a, b), c) to (a, (b, c)):\n\n((2,1),0) ↔ (2,(1,0))\n((2,3),0) ↔ (2,(3,0))\n((4,1),0) ↔ (4,(1,0))\n((4,3),0) ↔ (4,(3,0))\n((6,1),0) ↔ (6,(1,0))\n((6,3),0) ↔ (6,(3,0))\n\nSince there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of (A x B) x C and A x (B x C), we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is associative."
