    "message_2": "Let's use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, and we want to find the vertical distance from the ground to the top of the flagpole, which is the side opposite the angle. Let's call this distance h. The side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the person to the base of the building, which we'll call d.\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(60°) = h / d\n\nWe know that the flagpole is 20 meters tall, and it is fixed on top of the building. Let's call the height of the building b. Therefore, the total height from the ground to the top of the flagpole is h = b + 20.\n\nNow, we need to find the distance d. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between the height of the building (b), the distance from the person to the base of the building (d), and the distance from the person to the top of the flagpole (let's call this distance r).\n\nr^2 = b^2 + d^2\n\nSince we know the angle of elevation and the height of the flagpole, we can find the distance r using the sine function:\n\nsin(60°) = (b + 20) / r\n\nNow, we have two equations with two unknowns (b and d):\n\n1) tan(60°) = (b + 20) / d\n2) r^2 = b^2 + d^2\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the height from the ground to the top of the flagpole (b + 20).\n\nFirst, let's find the value of tan(60°):\n\ntan(60°) ≈ 1.732\n\nNow, substitute this value into equation 1:\n\n1.732 = (b + 20) / d\n\nNext, let's find the value of sin(60°):\n\nsin(60°) ≈ 0.866\n\nNow, substitute this value into the sine equation:\n\n0.866 = (b + 20) / r\n\nWe can now solve for d in terms of b from equation 1:\n\nd = (b + 20) / 1.732\n\nNow, substitute this expression for d into equation 2:\n\nr^2 = b^2 + ((b + 20) / 1.732)^2\n\nWe can now solve for r in terms of b from the sine equation:\n\nr = (b + 20) / 0.866\n\nNow, substitute this expression for r into the equation we derived above:\n\n((b + 20) / 0.866)^2 = b^2 + ((b + 20) / 1.732)^2\n\nNow, we can solve this equation for b:\n\nb ≈ 13.86 meters\n\nFinally, we can find the total height from the ground to the top of the flagpole:\n\nh = b + 20 ≈ 13.86 + 20 ≈ 33.86 meters\n\nRounded to the nearest meter, the vertical distance from the ground to the top of the flagpole is approximately 34 meters."
