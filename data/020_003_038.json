Check the endpoints of the interval and the critical points found in step 2 to determine the minimum value.\n\nStep 1: Find the derivative of the function with respect to x.\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 + 4x + 2) = 2x + 4\n\nStep 2: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x.\n2x + 4 = 0\n2x = -4\nx = -2\n\nStep 3: Check the endpoints of the interval and the critical points found in step 2 to determine the minimum value.\nf(-5) = (-5)^2 + 4(-5) + 2 = 25 - 20 + 2 = 7\nf(-2) = (-2)^2 + 4(-2) + 2 = 4 - 8 + 2 = -2\nf(3) = (3)^2 + 4(3) + 2 = 9 + 12 + 2 = 23\n\nComparing the values of the function at the endpoints and the critical point, we find that the minimum value of the function over the interval [-5, 3] is -2, which occurs at x = -2."
