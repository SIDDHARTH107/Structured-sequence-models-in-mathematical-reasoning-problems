    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible set of vertices that still covers all the edges.\n\nFor the given graph, we can find the minimum vertex cover by selecting the following vertices: {2, 4, 6}. This set of vertices covers all the edges in the graph, and no smaller set of vertices can cover all the edges.\n\nSo, the minimum vertex cover for this graph is {2, 4, 6}."
