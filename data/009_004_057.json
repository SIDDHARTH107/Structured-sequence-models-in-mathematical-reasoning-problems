    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the angular frequency (ω) of the system. The angular frequency is given by the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant (50 N/m) and m is the mass (0.5 kg). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nω = sqrt(50/0.5) = sqrt(100) = 10 rad/s\n\nNow, we know that the position function y(t) for a simple harmonic oscillator can be written as:\n\ny(t) = A*cos(ωt) + B*sin(ωt)\n\nwhere A and B are constants that depend on the initial conditions. In this case, we are given that at t=0, y(0) = 0.05 m and the initial velocity dy/dt(0) = 0.2 m/s.\n\nLet's first find the constant A. At t=0, y(0) = 0.05 m:\n\n0.05 = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0)\n0.05 = A*1 + B*0\nA = 0.05\n\nNow, let's find the constant B. We need to differentiate y(t) with respect to time t to get the velocity function:\n\ndy/dt = -A*ω*sin(ωt) + B*ω*cos(ωt)\n\nAt t=0, dy/dt(0) = 0.2 m/s:\n\n0.2 = -A*ω*sin(0) + B*ω*cos(0)\n0.2 = -0.05*10*0 + B*10*1\n0.2 = 10B\nB = 0.02\n\nNow we have the constants A and B, so we can write the position function y(t) as:\n\ny(t) = 0.05*cos(10t) + 0.02*sin(10t)"
