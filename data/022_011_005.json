    "message_2": "To find the zeros of the function, we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero, i.e., $z^3 - 1 = 0$. To find the poles, we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero, i.e., $z^2 - 1 = 0$.\n\nFirst, let's find the zeros of the function:\n\n$z^3 - 1 = 0$\n\nWe can factor this equation as:\n\n$(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) = 0$\n\nSo, the zeros of the function are:\n\n1. $z = 1$ (from the first factor)\n2. The roots of the quadratic equation $z^2 + z + 1 = 0$\n\nTo find the roots of the quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = 1$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$\n\nThe roots are:\n\n2. $z = \\frac{-1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n3. $z = \\frac{-1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\nNow, let's find the poles of the function:\n\n$z^2 - 1 = 0$\n\nWe can factor this equation as:\n\n$(z - 1)(z + 1) = 0$\n\nSo, the poles of the function are:\n\n1. $z = 1$\n2. $z = -1$\n\nHowever, we can see that $z = 1$ is both a zero and a pole of the function. In this case, we have a removable singularity at $z = 1$. We can simplify the function by canceling out the common factor:\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)}{(z - 1)(z + 1)}$\n\n$f(z) = \\frac{z^2 + z + 1}{z + 1}$\n\nNow, the function has a single pole at $z = -1$.\n\nTo determine the order of the zeros and poles, we look at the multiplicity of the factors in the numerator and denominator:\n\n1. Zero at $z = 1$: order 1 (from the factor $(z - 1)$)\n2. Zero at $z = \\frac{-1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$: order 1 (from the quadratic factor)\n3. Zero at $z = \\frac{-1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$: order 1 (from the quadratic factor)\n4. Pole at $z = -1$: order 1 (from the factor $(z + 1)$)\n\nSo, the zeros and poles of the function $f(z) = \\frac{z^3 - 1}{z^2 - 1}$ are:\n\nZeros:\n1. $z = 1$ with order 1\n2. $z = \\frac{-1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ with order 1\n3. $z = \\frac{-1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ with order 1\n\nPoles:\n1. $z = -1$ with order 1"
