    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the curve, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. Let $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 4x^2$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 + 8x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nA singular point occurs when both partial derivatives are equal to zero simultaneously. So, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n$-3x^2 + 8x = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $y = 0$. Now, we can substitute this value into the first equation:\n\n$-3x^2 + 8x = 0$\n\n$x(-3x + 8) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two possible values for x: $x = 0$ and $x = \\frac{8}{3}$. Therefore, we have two singular points: $(0, 0)$ and $(\\frac{8}{3}, 0)$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the types of these singular points. To do this, we will compute the second partial derivatives of F and evaluate the Hessian matrix at each singular point.\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x^2} = -6x + 8$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 F}{\\partial y^2} = 2$\n\nThe Hessian matrix is given by:\n\n$H = \\begin{bmatrix} -6x + 8 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nFor the singular point $(0, 0)$, we have:\n\n$H(0, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix} 8 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is $\\det(H(0, 0)) = 8 \\cdot 2 = 16 > 0$, and the trace is $\\text{tr}(H(0, 0)) = 8 + 2 = 10 > 0$. Since the determinant is positive and the trace is positive, the singular point $(0, 0)$ is a local minimum.\n\nFor the singular point $(\\frac{8}{3}, 0)$, we have:\n\n$H(\\frac{8}{3}, 0) = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{8}{3} + 8 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{16}{3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is $\\det(H(\\frac{8}{3}, 0)) = \\frac{16}{3} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{32}{3} > 0$, and the trace is $\\text{tr}(H(\\frac{8}{3}, 0)) = \\frac{16}{3} + 2 = \\frac{22}{3} > 0$. Since the determinant is positive and the trace is positive, the singular point $(\\frac{8}{3}, 0)$ is also a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, the algebraic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 4x^2$ has two singular points: $(0, 0)$ and $(\\frac{8}{3}, 0)$, both of which are local minima."
