    "message_2": "To prove that (A △ B) △ C = A △ (B △ C), we will first find the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the symmetric difference of the result with C. After that, we will find the symmetric difference of B and C, and then find the symmetric difference of the result with A. If both results are the same, then the equality holds.\n\nRecall that the symmetric difference of two sets X and Y, denoted by X △ Y, is the set of elements which are in either X or Y, but not in their intersection. In other words, X △ Y = (X ∪ Y) - (X ∩ Y).\n\n1. Find A △ B:\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3, 4})\nA △ B = ({1, 2, 3, 4}) - ({2, 3}) = {1, 4}\n\n2.
