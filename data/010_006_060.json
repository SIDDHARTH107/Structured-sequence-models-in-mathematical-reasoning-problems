    "message_2": "To determine the homotopy group $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}^2 - F(I\\times I),f(0))$, we first need to understand the topology of the complement of the image of $F$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. \n\nSince $F(s,t) = f(st)$, we can see that the image of $F$ is a continuous deformation of the image of $f$ as $t$ varies from $0$ to $1$. At $t=0$, the image of $F$ is just the point $(1,0)$, and at $t=1$, the image of $F$ is the entire image of $f$. For $0<t<1$, the image of $F$ is a \"shrinking\" version of the image of $f$. \n\nNow, let's consider the complement of the image of $F$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Since $f(0)=(1,0)$ and $f(1)=(0,1)$, the image of $f$ connects the points $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ in the plane. The complement of the image of $F$ consists of two connected components: one inside the \"loop\" formed by the image of $f$ and one outside.\n\nLet $x_0 = f(0) = (1,0)$. We want to compute the fundamental group $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}^2 - F(I\\times I), x_0)$. Since the complement of the image of $F$ has two connected components, we can use the van Kampen theorem to compute the fundamental group.\n\nLet $U$ be an open neighborhood of the \"inside\" connected component, and $V$ be an open neighborhood of the \"outside\" connected component, such that $U \\cap V$ is an open neighborhood of the image of $F$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}^2 - F(I\\times I), x_0) \\cong \\pi_1(U, x_0) *_{\\pi_1(U \\cap V, x_0)} \\pi_1(V, x_0)$.\n\nSince $U$ is homeomorphic to a disk, its fundamental group is trivial: $\\pi_1(U, x_0) \\cong 0$. On the other hand, $V$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with a \"hole\" in it, so its fundamental group is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the circle: $\\pi_1(V, x_0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFinally, since $U \\cap V$ is an open neighborhood of the image of $F$, it is also contractible, and its fundamental group is trivial: $\\pi_1(U \\cap V, x_0) \\cong 0$.\n\nUsing the van Kampen theorem, we get:\n\n$\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}^2 - F(I\\times I), x_0) \\cong 0 *_{0} \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSo the homotopy group $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{R}^2 - F(I\\times I),f(0))$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$."
