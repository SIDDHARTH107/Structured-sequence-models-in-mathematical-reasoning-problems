    "message_2": "To model the population growth of rabbits on the island, we can use the exponential growth equation:\n\nP(t) = P0 * e^(kt)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P0 is the initial population, k is the growth rate, and t is the time in months.\n\nSince the population doubles every 6 months, we can find the growth rate k as follows:\n\nP(6) = 2 * P0\n\n100 * e^(6k) = 2 * 100\n\ne^(6k) = 2\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n6k = ln(2)\n\nk = ln(2) / 6\n\nNow we have the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = k * P\n\ndP/dt = (ln(2) / 6) * P\n\nTo find the population after 3 years (36 months), we can use the exponential growth equation:\n\nP(36) = 100 * e^((ln(2) / 6) * 36)\n\nP(36) = 100 * e^(ln(2) * 6)\n\nP(36) = 100 * 2^6\n\nP(36) = 100 * 64\n\nP(36) = 6400\n\nSo, after 3 years, the population of rabbits on the island will be 6,400."
