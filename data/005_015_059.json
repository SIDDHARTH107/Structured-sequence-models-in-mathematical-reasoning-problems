Using cluster analysis, group the customers based on their shopping behavior into three distinct clusters. The amount spent by each customer in each of the five categories are shown below:\n\nCustomer | Category 1($) | Category 2($) | Category 3($) | Category 4($) | Category 5($)\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n1 | 20 | 10 | 15 | 5 | 20\n2 | 30 | 20 | 5 | 15 | 5\n3 | 10 | 5 | 30 | 5 | 40\n4 | 5 | 5 | 10 | 5 | 15\n5 | 5 | 20 | 5 | 10 | 5\n6 | 20 | 5 | 15 | 5 | 30\n7 | 5 | 10 | 5 | 20 | 5",
    "message_2": "To perform cluster analysis, we will use the k-means clustering algorithm. We will group the customers into three distinct clusters based on their shopping behavior. \n\nStep 1: Normalize the data\nTo ensure that each category has equal weight in the clustering process, we need to normalize the data. We will use min-max normalization for this purpose.\n\nNormalized value = (Original value - Min value) / (Max value - Min value)\n\nNormalized data:\n\nCustomer | Category 1 | Category 2 | Category 3 | Category 4 | Category 5\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n1 | 0.6 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0 | 0.6\n2 | 1 | 0.75 | 0 | 0.5 | 0\n3 | 0.2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n4 | 0 | 0 | 0.2 | 0 | 0.4\n5 | 0 | 0.75 | 0 | 0.25 | 0\n6 | 0.6 | 0 | 0.5 | 0 | 0.8\n7 | 0 | 0.25 | 0 | 0.75 | 0\n\nStep 2: Initialize cluster centroids\nWe will randomly select three customers as initial cluster centroids.\n\nCluster 1: Customer 1 (0.6, 0.25, 0.5, 0, 0.6)\nCluster 2: Customer 3 (0.2, 0, 1, 0, 1)\nCluster 3: Customer 5 (0, 0.75, 0, 0.25, 0)\n\nStep 3: Assign customers to the nearest centroid\nCalculate the Euclidean distance between each customer and the centroids, and assign each customer to the nearest centroid.\n\nStep 4: Update centroids\nCalculate the mean of the customers assigned to each centroid and update the centroid coordinates.\n\nRepeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids do not change significantly or a predefined number of iterations is reached.\n\nFinal Clusters:\n\nCluster 1: Customer 1, Customer 6\nCluster 2: Customer 3, Customer 4\nCluster 3: Customer 2, Customer 5, Customer 7\n\nSo, based on their shopping behavior, the customers can be grouped into three distinct clusters as shown above."
