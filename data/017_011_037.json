    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 and n_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.\n2. n_3 divides 4 and n_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\nFrom these conditions, we find that n_2 is either 1 or 3, and n_3 is either 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1.\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, P_2 âˆ© P_3 = {e}, where e is the identity element of G. By the direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is a cyclic group of order 12. Thus, G is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1.\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 of order 3, which is normal in G. Let H be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, |G:P_3| = 4, and by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the action of G on the set of left cosets of P_3 by left multiplication is a homomorphism from G to S_4. Let K be the kernel of this homomorphism. Since P_3 is normal in G, K must contain P_3. Moreover, |G/K| divides |S_4| = 24, so |K| divides 12. Since P_3 is a subgroup of K, we have |K| = 3 or |K| = 12. If |K| = 12, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_4, which must be A4, since A4 is the only subgroup of S_4 of order 12. If |K| = 3, then |G/K| = 4, and G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_4 of order 4. The only such subgroups are the Klein four-group V and the cyclic group C4. However, G has a normal subgroup of order 3, so it cannot be isomorphic to V or C4. Thus, in this case, G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4.\nIn this case, G has no normal Sylow subgroups. Let H be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then, |G:H| = 3, and by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the action of G on the set of left cosets of H by left multiplication is a homomorphism from G to S_3. Let K be the kernel of this homomorphism. Since H is not normal in G, K must be a proper subgroup of H. Moreover, |G/K| divides |S_3| = 6, so |K| divides 12. Since H is a subgroup of K, we have |K| = 2 or |K| = 4. If |K| = 2, then |G/K| = 6, and G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_3 of order 6. The only such subgroup is S_3 itself, which has a normal subgroup of order 2, contradicting the assumption that G has no normal Sylow subgroups. Thus, |K| = 4, and G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S_3 of order 4. The only such subgroup is the dihedral group D3, which has a normal subgroup of order 2, again contradicting the assumption that G has no normal Sylow subgroups. Thus, this case is impossible.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6."
