    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the fact that every group of prime power order has a non-trivial center. In our case, the order of G is 9, which is a prime power (3^2).\n\nLet Z(G) be the center of G. Since G has order 9 and |Z(G)| > 1, the possible orders of Z(G) are 3 or 9. If |Z(G)| = 9, then G is abelian and any non-identity element g in G generates a subgroup of order 3 or 9. If the order of the subgroup is 9, we are done. If the order is 3, then G has three such subgroups, each with two non-identity elements. Since G has only 8 non-identity elements, there must be an overlap between these subgroups. Let the subgroups be H1 = {1, g1, g1^2} and H2 = {1, g2, g2^2}, with g1^2 = g2. Then g1g2 is not in H1 or H2, and the subgroup generated by g1g2 must have order 9, as desired.\n\nIf |Z(G)| = 3, let Z(G) = {1, z1, z1^2}, where z1 is an element of order 3. Then G/Z(G) is a group of order 3, which is cyclic. Let gZ(G) be a generator of G/Z(G), where g is an element of G. Then (gZ(G))^3 = g^3Z(G) = Z(G), so g^3 is in Z(G). Since g is not in Z(G), we have g^3 = z1 or g^3 = z1^2. In either case, g has order 9 in G, and the subgroup generated by g is the entire group G.\n\nThus, we have shown that there exists an element g in G such that the subgroup generated by g is the entire group G."
