    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: A and B. The cost of producing each product depends on the type of raw material used, which can be of two grades: high and low. The cost of producing one unit of product A is $10 with high-grade raw material and $15 with low-grade raw material. The cost of producing one unit of product B is $12 with high-grade raw material and $18 with low-grade raw material. The factory has a limited amount of raw material, and there are uncertainty and variability in the raw material supply. Assuming that the factory wants to maximize its profit, formulate a robust optimization problem to determine the production quantities of A and B that will maximize profits given the following information:\n\n- The factory has 500 units of high-grade raw material and 400 units of low-grade raw material available.\n- The raw material supply may vary by up to 20% from the expected values.\n- The profit for each unit of product A sold is $25, and the profit for each unit of product B sold is $30. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit that the factory can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x_AH and x_AL be the number of units of product A produced using high-grade and low-grade raw materials, respectively. Similarly, let x_BH and x_BL be the number of units of product B produced using high-grade and low-grade raw materials, respectively.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit, which can be represented as:\n\nProfit = 25(x_AH + x_AL) + 30(x_BH + x_BL) - 10x_AH - 15x_AL - 12x_BH - 18x_BL\n\nSimplifying the profit equation:\n\nProfit = 15x_AH + 10x_AL + 18x_BH + 12x_BL\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n1. High-grade raw material constraint: x_AH + x_BH ≤ 500\n2. Low-grade raw material constraint: x_AL + x_BL ≤ 400\n3. Uncertainty in high-grade raw material supply: x_AH + x_BH ≤ (1 + 0.2) * 500 = 600\n4. Uncertainty in low-grade raw material supply: x_AL + x_BL ≤ (1 + 0.2) * 400 = 480\n5. Non-negativity constraints: x_AH, x_AL, x_BH, x_BL ≥ 0\n\nNow, we can solve this linear programming problem to find the optimal production quantities that maximize the profit.\n\nUsing a linear programming solver, we find the optimal solution as:\n\nx_AH = 0, x_AL = 400, x_BH = 500, x_BL = 0\n\nThe maximum profit that the factory can make is:\n\nProfit = 15(0) + 10(400) + 18(500) + 12(0) = 0 + 4000 + 9000 = $13,000"
