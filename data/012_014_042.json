    "message_2": "To determine if graphs G and H are isomorphic, we need to check if there exists a bijection (one-to-one and onto mapping) between the vertices of G and H such that the adjacency is preserved.\n\nLet's analyze the degree of each vertex in both graphs:\n\nFor graph G:\n- Vertex 1 has a degree of 2 (connected to vertices 2 and 3)\n- Vertex 2 has a degree of 2 (connected to vertices 1 and 3)\n- Vertex 3 has a degree of 2 (connected to vertices 1 and 2)\n\nFor graph H:\n- Vertex 1 has a degree of 1 (connected to vertex 3)\n- Vertex 2 has a degree of 1 (connected to vertex 3)\n- Vertex 3 has a degree of 2 (connected to vertices 1 and 2)\n\nFrom the degree sequences, we can see that the two graphs have different degree sequences (G has all vertices with degree 2, while H has two vertices with degree 1 and one vertex with degree 2). Since the degree sequences are not the same, graphs G and H cannot be isomorphic."
