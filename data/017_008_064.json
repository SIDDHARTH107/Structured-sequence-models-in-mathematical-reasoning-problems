    "message_2": "There are five distinct groups of order 8 up to isomorphism. They are:\n\n1. The cyclic group C8\n2. The quaternion group Q8\n3. The dihedral group D4\n4. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2, C2 x C2 x C2\n5. The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2, C4 x C2\n\nNow, we will show that each of these groups is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4.\n\n1. C8 is already the cyclic group of order 8.\n\n2. Q8 is already the quaternion group of order 8.\n\n3. D4 is already the dihedral group of order 8.\n\n4. The group C2 x C2 x C2 has the following presentation: ⟨a, b, c | a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1, ab = ba, ac = ca, bc = cb⟩. This group is not isomorphic to C8, Q8, or D4. However, it is isomorphic to the direct product of C2 x C2 and C2, which is a subgroup of D4. Therefore, we can consider this group as a part of the dihedral group D4.\n\n5. The group C4 x C2 has the following presentation: ⟨a, b | a^4 = b^2 = 1, ab = ba^3⟩. This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4. To see this, consider the following isomorphism:\n\nϕ: C4 x C2 → D4\nϕ(a) = r\nϕ(b) = s\n\nwhere r and s are the standard generators of D4 with relations r^4 = s^2 = 1 and rs = sr^3. It is easy to verify that ϕ is a homomorphism and a bijection, so it is an isomorphism.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three distinct groups of order 8 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, and the dihedral group D4."
