    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function, we first need to find its first derivative and set it equal to zero.\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 1 and x = 3. These are the critical points of the function.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether each critical point corresponds to a maximum, minimum, or saddle point. To do this, we can use the second derivative test.\n\nFind the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, evaluate the second derivative at each critical point:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 12 = -6\nf''(3) = 6(3) - 12 = 6\n\nSince f''(1) < 0, the critical point x = 1 corresponds to a local maximum.\nSince f''(3) > 0, the critical point x = 3 corresponds to a local minimum.\n\nIn conclusion, the critical points of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x are x = 1 (local maximum) and x = 3 (local minimum)."
