    "message_2": "To find the average value of the function f(x) = 3sin(x) - 4cos(x) on the interval [0, π], we need to integrate the function over the interval and then divide by the length of the interval.\n\nThe average value formula is:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[a, b] f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, a = 0 and b = π. So the formula becomes:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * ∫[0, π] (3sin(x) - 4cos(x)) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of the function:\n\n∫(3sin(x) - 4cos(x)) dx = -3cos(x) - 4sin(x) + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral at the limits of the interval:\n\n(-3cos(π) - 4sin(π)) - (-3cos(0) - 4sin(0)) = (-3(-1) - 4(0)) - (-3(1) - 4(0)) = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nNow, we can find the average value:\n\nAverage value = (1/π) * 6 = 6/π\n\nSo, the average value of f(x) = 3sin(x) - 4cos(x) on the interval [0, π] is 6/π."
