    "message_2": "The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven a diameter of 8 meters, the circumference can be calculated as follows:\n\nC = π * 8\nC ≈ 3.14159 * 8\nC ≈ 25.13272\n\nTherefore, the circumference of the circle is approximately 25.13 meters."
