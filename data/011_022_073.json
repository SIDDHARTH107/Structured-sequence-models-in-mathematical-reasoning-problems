The available items are:\n\n|   Item   | Weight (kg) | Value ($) |\n|:--------:|:----------:|:--------:|\n|    1     |      3     |    150   |\n|    2     |      5     |    200   |\n|    3     |      8     |    300   |\n|    4     |      2     |    100   |\n|    5     |      4     |    180   | \n\nWhat is the maximum value of items that the store manager can fit into the knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of items that the store manager can fit into the knapsack, we can use a greedy algorithm that selects items based on their value-to-weight ratio. First, let's calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item:\n\n|   Item   | Weight (kg) | Value ($) | Value-to-Weight Ratio |\n|:--------:|:----------:|:--------:|:---------------------:|\n|    1     |      3     |    150   |          50           |\n|    2     |      5     |    200   |          40           |\n|    3     |      8     |    300   |         37.5          |\n|    4     |      2     |    100   |          50           |\n|    5     |      4     |    180   |          45           |\n\nNow, we can sort the items by their value-to-weight ratio in descending order:\n\n1. Item 1 (3kg, $150, ratio 50)\n2. Item 4 (2kg, $100, ratio 50)\n3. Item 5 (4kg, $180, ratio 45)\n4. Item 2 (5kg, $200, ratio 40)\n5. Item 3 (8kg, $300, ratio 37.5)\n\nNext, we can start adding items to the knapsack, starting with the highest value-to-weight ratio, until the knapsack is full or no more items can be added:\n\n1. Add Item 1 (3kg, $150): knapsack weight = 3kg, value = $150\n2. Add Item 4 (2kg, $100): knapsack weight = 5kg, value = $250\n3. Add Item 5 (4kg, $180): knapsack weight = 9kg, value = $430\n4. Add Item 2 (5kg, $200): knapsack weight = 14kg, value = $630\n\nAt this point, we cannot add Item 3 because it would exceed the maximum weight of 15kg. Therefore, the maximum value of items that the store manager can fit into the knapsack is $630."
