    "message_2": "To solve this integer programming problem, we can use the graphical method to find the feasible region and then check the integer points within that region to find the maximum value of the objective function.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 3y ≤ 30\nDivide by 2: x + 1.5y ≤ 15\ny ≤ (10/3) - (2/3)x\n\n2. 4x + 5y ≤ 50\nDivide by 4: x + 1.25y ≤ 12.5\ny ≤ 10 - 0.8x\n\n3. x, y ≥ 0\n\nNow, we can find the feasible region by plotting these lines and inequalities on a graph. The feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied simultaneously.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at the points (0,0), (0,10), (6,4), and (10,0).\n\nNow, we need to check the integer points within the feasible region and evaluate the objective function 5x + 3y at each point:\n\n1. (0,0): 5(0) + 3(0) = 0\n2. (0,10): 5(0) + 3(10) = 30\n3. (6,4): 5(6) + 3(4) = 42\n4. (10,0): 5(10) + 3(0) = 50\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 50, which occurs at the point (10,0)."
