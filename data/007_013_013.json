    "message_2": "The conjecture that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers is known as the Goldbach Conjecture. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even numbers up to very large values, and it has been found to hold true for all tested cases. However, it remains an unproven conjecture.\n\nSo, as of now, there is no known smallest even number that cannot be written as the sum of two prime numbers, since the Goldbach Conjecture has not been disproven."
