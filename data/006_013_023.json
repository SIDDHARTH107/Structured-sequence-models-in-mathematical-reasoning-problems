    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, hurricanes) occurring in a fixed interval of time (in this case, one year or five years).\n\n1. Probability of a hurricane occurring within a certain region in one year:\n\nThe average number of hurricanes per year (λ) is 0.25. Using the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * (λ^k)) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of hurricanes, k is the desired number of hurricanes (in this case, 1), e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and λ is the average number of hurricanes per year.\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-0.25) * (0.25^1)) / 1!\nP(X = 1) ≈ (0.7788 * 0.25) / 1\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.1947\n\nSo, the probability of a hurricane occurring within a certain region in one year is approximately 19.47%.\n\n2. Probability of at least two hurricanes occurring in a five-year period:\n\nIn this case, we need to calculate the probability of having 0 or 1 hurricane in a five-year period and then subtract it from 1 to find the probability of at least two hurricanes.\n\nFirst, we need to adjust the average number of hurricanes for a five-year period: λ = 0.25 * 5 = 1.25.\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-1.25) * (1.25^0)) / 0!\nP(X = 0) ≈ (0.2865 * 1) / 1\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.2865\n\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-1.25) * (1.25^1)) / 1!\nP(X = 1) ≈ (0.2865 * 1.25) / 1\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.3581\n\nNow, we find the probability of having 0 or 1 hurricane in a five-year period:\n\nP(X ≤ 1) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)\nP(X ≤ 1) ≈ 0.2865 + 0.3581\nP(X ≤ 1) ≈ 0.6446\n\nFinally, we find the probability of at least two hurricanes in a five-year period:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X ≤ 1)\nP(X ≥ 2) ≈ 1 - 0.6446\nP(X ≥ 2) ≈ 0.3554\n\nSo, the probability of at least two hurricanes occurring in that region in a five-year period is approximately 35.54%."
