    "message_1": "A voltage signal has a frequency content of 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 150 Hz with amplitudes of 10 V, 5 V, and 3 V respectively. Using Fourier transform, determine the frequency spectrum of the signal.",
    "message_2": "To determine the frequency spectrum of the given voltage signal using Fourier transform, we first need to represent the signal as a sum of sinusoidal functions. The given signal has three frequency components: 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 150 Hz with amplitudes of 10 V, 5 V, and 3 V respectively. Therefore, the signal can be represented as:\n\nv(t) = 10*sin(2π*50*t) + 5*sin(2π*100*t) + 3*sin(2π*150*t)\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier transform to determine the frequency spectrum of the signal. The Fourier transform of a continuous-time signal v(t) is given by:\n\nV(f) = ∫[v(t) * e^(-j*2π*f*t)] dt\n\nHowever, in this case, since we already have the signal represented as a sum of sinusoidal functions, we can directly write the frequency spectrum by identifying the amplitudes and frequencies of the sinusoids. The frequency spectrum will have three non-zero components at the frequencies 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 150 Hz with amplitudes 10 V, 5 V, and 3 V respectively.\n\nSo, the frequency spectrum V(f) can be represented as:\n\nV(f) = 10δ(f-50) + 5δ(f-100) + 3δ(f-150)\n\nwhere δ(f) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nThis representation shows that the frequency spectrum of the given voltage signal has three distinct components at 50 Hz, 100 Hz, and 150 Hz with amplitudes of 10 V, 5 V, and 3 V respectively."
