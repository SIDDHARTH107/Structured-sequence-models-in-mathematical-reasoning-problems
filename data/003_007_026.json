    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of lengths 4 and 6 and an included angle of 60 degrees. What is the length of the third side?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side of the triangle. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c and an included angle C between sides a and b, the following equation holds:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have a = 4, b = 6, and C = 60 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc² = 4² + 6² - 2 * 4 * 6 * cos(π / 3)\nc² = 16 + 36 - 48 * (1/2)\nc² = 52 - 24\nc² = 28\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the third side:\n\nc = √28 ≈ 5.29\n\nSo, the length of the third side is approximately 5.29 units."
