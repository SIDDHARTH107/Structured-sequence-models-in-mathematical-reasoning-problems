    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60 which are neither cyclic nor direct product of a cyclic group with a subgroup of order 2, we first need to analyze the possible structures of groups of order 60.\n\nThe prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. Using the Sylow theorems, we can determine the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor:\n\n- For p = 2, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is 1, 3, or 15.\n- For p = 3, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is 1, 4, or 10.\n- For p = 5, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups is 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible structures of groups of order 60 based on the number of Sylow p-subgroups:\n\n1. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, the group is cyclic, which we want to exclude.\n\n2. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 3-subgroup, but six Sylow 5-subgroups, the group is a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 12 with a cyclic group of order 5. This is not a direct product of a cyclic group with a subgroup of order 2, so we count this case.\n\n3. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup, but four Sylow 3-subgroups, the group is a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 20 with a cyclic group of order 3. This is not a direct product of a cyclic group with a subgroup of order 2, so we count this case.\n\n4. If there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, the group is a direct product of a cyclic group of order 15 with a subgroup of order 4. This is a direct product of a cyclic group with a subgroup of order 2, so we exclude this case.\n\n5. If there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and six Sylow 5-subgroups, the group is a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 15 with a subgroup of order 4. This is not a direct product of a cyclic group with a subgroup of order 2, so we count this case.\n\n6. If there are fifteen Sylow 2-subgroups, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and one Sylow 5-subgroup, the group is a direct product of a cyclic group of order 15 with a subgroup of order 4. This is a direct product of a cyclic group with a subgroup of order 2, so we exclude this case.\n\n7. If there are fifteen Sylow 2-subgroups, one Sylow 3-subgroup, and six Sylow 5-subgroups, the group is a semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 15 with a subgroup of order 4. This is not a direct product of a cyclic group with a subgroup of order 2, so we count this case.\n\nIn total, we have found 4 non-isomorphic groups of order 60 which are neither cyclic nor direct product of a cyclic group with a subgroup of order 2."
