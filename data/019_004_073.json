It is currently 10:00 AM.\n2. The temperature outside is above 30°C from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.\n3. At 3:00 PM, you decide to check if the pool is clean.\n\nDetermine the truth value of formula A at each of the following times:\n\na) 12:00 PM\nb) 4:00 PM\nc) 7:00 PM",
    "message_2": "To determine the truth value of formula A at each of the given times, we need to evaluate the formula based on the given information.\n\na) 12:00 PM:\nAt 12:00 PM, the temperature outside is above 30°C (p is true), and we have not yet checked if the pool is clean (q is unknown). Since q is unknown, we cannot determine the truth value of ¬q. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of ◊(p ∧ ¬q) at this time. Similarly, we cannot determine the truth value of [](p → q) at this time. Thus, the truth value of formula A at 12:00 PM is undetermined.\n\nb) 4:00 PM:\nAt 4:00 PM, the temperature outside is still above 30°C (p is true), and we have checked if the pool is clean at 3:00 PM. However, we do not know the outcome of the pool check, so q is still unknown. As in the previous case, we cannot determine the truth value of ◊(p ∧ ¬q) or [](p → q) at this time. Thus, the truth value of formula A at 4:00 PM is undetermined.\n\nc) 7:00 PM:\nAt 7:00 PM, the temperature outside is no longer above 30°C (p is false), and we have checked if the pool is clean at 3:00 PM. Again, we do not know the outcome of the pool check, so q is still unknown. Since p is false, the implication p → q is true regardless of the truth value of q. Therefore, [](p → q) is true. However, since p is false, the conjunction p ∧ ¬q is also false, and ◊(p ∧ ¬q) is false. Thus, the truth value of formula A at 7:00 PM is false, as both parts of the conjunction are not true."
