    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 35, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. In this case, the order of the group is 35, which is the product of the prime factors 5 and 7 (35 = 5 * 7).\n\nNow, let's find the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor:\n\n1. For p = 5: By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide the index 7 (the order of the group divided by 5), and n_5 must be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility for n_5 is 1.\n\n2. For p = 7: Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, must divide the index 5 (the order of the group divided by 7), and n_7 must be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility for n_7 is 1.\n\nSince there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup, both of them are normal in the group. Let P be the Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 7-subgroup. Since P and Q are both normal, their product PQ is also a subgroup of the group. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime (5 and 7 are coprime), we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 5 * 7 = 35.\n\nThus, the group is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are both cyclic (since they have prime order). Therefore, the group is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups, C_5 and C_7, which is the cyclic group C_35.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one non-isomorphic group of order 35, which is the cyclic group C_35."
