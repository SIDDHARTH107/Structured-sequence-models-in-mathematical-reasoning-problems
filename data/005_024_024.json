The company wants to find the mean number of clicks per day. The data is as follows:\n15, 20, 22, 16, 18, 25, 21, 19, 24, 17, 14, 23, 20, 22, 27, 19, 18, 21, 26, 20, 16, 23, 22, 19, 21, 20, 24, 17, 18, 22\n\nCalculate the mean number of clicks per day for the past month using data mining.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the mean number of clicks per day, we need to add up all the clicks and divide by the number of days.\n\nMean = (Sum of clicks) / (Number of days)\n\nSum of clicks = 15 + 20 + 22 + 16 + 18 + 25 + 21 + 19 + 24 + 17 + 14 + 23 + 20 + 22 + 27 + 19 + 18 + 21 + 26 + 20 + 16 + 23 + 22 + 19 + 21 + 20 + 24 + 17 + 18 + 22 = 639\n\nNumber of days = 30\n\nMean = 639 / 30 = 21.3\n\nThe mean number of clicks per day for the past month is 21.3."
