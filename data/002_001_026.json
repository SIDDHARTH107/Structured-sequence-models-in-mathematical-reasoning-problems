    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 6 cm and the height is 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (6 * 4) / 2\nArea = 24 / 2\nArea = 12 cmÂ²\n\nThe area of the triangle is 12 square centimeters."
