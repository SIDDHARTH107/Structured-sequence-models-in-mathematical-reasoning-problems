    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In the case of a 4x4 Latin square, we have 4 different symbols (let's say 1, 2, 3, and 4) and we need to arrange them in a 4x4 grid such that each symbol appears once in each row and column.\n\nTo count the number of 4x4 Latin squares, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 ways.\n2. The second row can be filled in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 ways. This is because the second row must have the remaining 3 symbols in some order that is not the same as the first row.\n3. The third row can be filled in 2 ways, as there are only two possible arrangements of the remaining symbols that satisfy the Latin square condition.\n4. The fourth row is determined by the previous rows, as there is only one way to arrange the remaining symbols to satisfy the Latin square condition.\n\nSo, the total number of 4x4 Latin squares is 4! x 3! x 2 = 24 x 6 x 2 = 288."
