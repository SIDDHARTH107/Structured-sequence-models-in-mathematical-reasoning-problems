    "message_2": "To find the area of the right-angled triangular field, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: \n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nSince we are asked to use trigonometry, let's find the angle between the base and the height. Let's call this angle θ. We can use the tangent function, which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (base):\n\ntan(θ) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(θ) = 9 / 12\ntan(θ) = 3 / 4\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse tangent (arctan) of both sides:\n\nθ = arctan(3/4)\n\nNow that we have the angle θ, we can use the sine function to find the area of the triangle. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (height) to the hypotenuse (let's call it c):\n\nsin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse\nsin(θ) = 9 / c\n\nWe can find the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc² = base² + height²\nc² = 12² + 9²\nc² = 144 + 81\nc² = 225\nc = √225\nc = 15\n\nNow, we can plug the value of c back into the sine equation:\n\nsin(θ) = 9 / 15\nsin(θ) = 3 / 5\n\nNow, we can use the sine function to find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height * sin(θ)\nArea = (1/2) * 12 * 9 * (3/5)\n\nArea = 6 * 9 * (3/5)\nArea = 54 * (3/5)\nArea = 162 / 5\nArea = 32.4\n\nThe area of the right-angled triangular field is 32.4 square meters."
