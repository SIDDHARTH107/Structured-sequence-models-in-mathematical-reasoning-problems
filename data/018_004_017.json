    "message_2": "To determine the size of B and C, we need to know the size of the universal set, which contains all elements under consideration. The complement of a set A, denoted by A', B, or C in this case, contains all elements in the universal set that are not in A.\n\nWithout knowing the size of the universal set, we cannot determine the size of B and C."
