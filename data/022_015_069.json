Find the reflection of the function f(z) into the lower half-plane Im(z) < 0 using the Schwarz reflection principle. \n\nHint: Remember to use the properties of analytic continuation and the reflection principle to extend f(z) into the lower half-plane.",
    "message_2": "To find the reflection of the function f(z) into the lower half-plane Im(z) < 0 using the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to find the conjugate of the function f(z) with respect to the real axis. Let's denote this conjugate function as g(z).\n\nAccording to the Schwarz reflection principle, g(z) is the analytic continuation of f(z) into the lower half-plane, and it satisfies the following condition:\n\ng(z) = f(conj(z))\n\nwhere conj(z) is the complex conjugate of z.\n\nNow, let's find g(z) for the given function f(z) = x^2, where x is a real number.\n\ng(z) = f(conj(z))\ng(z) = (conj(z))^2\n\nNow, let's consider a complex number z = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit.\n\ng(a + bi) = (a - bi)^2\ng(a + bi) = a^2 - 2abi + (bi)^2\ng(a + bi) = a^2 - 2abi - b^2\n\nSo, the reflection of the function f(z) = x^2 into the lower half-plane Im(z) < 0 using the Schwarz reflection principle is:\n\ng(z) = a^2 - 2abi - b^2, where z = a + bi and a, b are real numbers."
