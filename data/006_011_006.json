    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one workplace accident occurring in a week, we can first find the probability of no accidents occurring in a week and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no accident occurring in a day is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the factory operates for 5 days in a week, the probability of no accidents occurring in the entire week is (0.95)^5.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one accident occurring in a week by subtracting the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\nP(at least one accident) = 1 - P(no accidents)\nP(at least one accident) = 1 - (0.95)^5\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nP(at least one accident) = 1 - (0.95)^5 ≈ 1 - 0.7737809375 ≈ 0.2262190625\n\nSo, the probability of at least one workplace accident occurring in a week is approximately 0.2262 or 22.62%."
