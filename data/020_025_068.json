The distance between each location is shown in the table below:\n\n| Location | A      | B      | C      | D      |\n|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| A        | 0      | 9      | 12     | 7      |\n| B        | 9      | 0      | 6      | 5      |\n| C        | 12     | 6      | 0      | 8      |\n| D        | 7      | 5      | 8      | 0      |\n\nThe driver wants to find the optimal route to take, such that they minimize the total distance traveled. If the driver starts and ends at location A, what is the optimal route they should take to visit all four locations? What is the total distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we need to consider all possible routes and calculate the total distance for each route. Since the driver starts and ends at location A, we only need to consider the order in which the driver visits locations B, C, and D.\n\nThere are 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 possible routes:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → A\n2. A → B → D → C → A\n3. A → C → B → D → A\n4. A → C → D → B → A\n5. A → D → B → C → A\n6. A → D → C → B → A\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance for each route:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → A: 9 + 6 + 8 + 7 = 30\n2. A → B → D → C → A: 9 + 5 + 8 + 12 = 34\n3. A → C → B → D → A: 12 + 6 + 5 + 7 = 30\n4. A → C → D → B → A: 12 + 8 + 5 + 9 = 34\n5. A → D → B → C → A: 7 + 5 + 6 + 12 = 30\n6. A → D → C → B → A: 7 + 8 + 6 + 9 = 30\n\nThe optimal routes are routes 1, 3, 5, and 6, as they all have the minimum total distance of 30. The driver can choose any of these routes to minimize the total distance traveled."
