    "message_2": "To find the seasonal index for the month of December, we need to divide the expected sales for December by the average monthly sales for the two years.\n\nSeasonal Index = (Expected Sales for December) / (Average Monthly Sales)\n\nSeasonal Index = ($45,000) / ($50,000)\n\nSeasonal Index = 0.9\n\nThe seasonal index for the month of December is 0.9, which means that the sales in December are 90% of the average monthly sales for the two years."
