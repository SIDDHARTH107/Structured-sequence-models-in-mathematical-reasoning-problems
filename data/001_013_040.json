    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(3x+7) = 5, we need to get rid of the square root. We can do this by squaring both sides of the equation:\n\n(√(3x+7))^2 = 5^2\n\nNow, we simplify:\n\n3x + 7 = 25\n\nNext, we isolate the variable x by subtracting 7 from both sides:\n\n3x = 18\n\nFinally, we divide both sides by 3 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 6"
