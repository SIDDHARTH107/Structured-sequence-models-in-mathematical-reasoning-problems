    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is generated by replacing each line segment with a smaller segment that is 1/3 of the original length, and then adding two more segments of the same length, forming a 60-degree angle.\n\nAfter the 5th iteration, the length of each segment of the Koch curve is (1/3)^5 = 1/243.\n\nIn the original equilateral triangle, each side has a length of 1 unit. After the 5th iteration, each side of the triangle is replaced by the Koch curve with 4^5 = 1024 segments of length 1/243.\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch island after the 5th iteration is:\n\n3 sides × 1024 segments/side × 1/243 length/segment = 3072/243 = 12.64 units."
