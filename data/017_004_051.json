    "message_2": "Since G has order 25, by the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 25\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup, which must be normal in G. Let H be this 5-Sylow subgroup. Since H is normal and has order 5, it is a cyclic group of order 5, generated by some element a ∈ G with a^5 = e (the identity element of G).\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. Since |G| = 25 and |H| = 5, we have |G/H| = 5. Thus, G/H is a cyclic group of order 5, generated by some coset bH, where b ∈ G. Since (bH)^5 = H, we have b^5 ∈ H. Since H is generated by a, there exists an integer k such that b^5 = a^k.\n\nIf k = 0, then b^5 = e, and G is generated by a and b, making G a cyclic group of order 25. In this case, G is isomorphic to Z_25, the additive group of integers modulo 25.\n\nIf k ≠ 0, then 1 ≤ k ≤ 4 (since 0 < k < 5). Since 5 is prime, the smallest positive integer n such that a^(kn) = e is n = 5. Thus, b^25 = a^(5k) = e. Since b^5 = a^k, we have b^25 = (b^5)^5 = (a^k)^5 = a^(5k) = e. Therefore, the order of b is 25 or a divisor of 25. Since b is not in H, the order of b cannot be 5, so the order of b must be 25.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup K generated by b. Since the order of b is 25, K is a cyclic group of order 25. Since |G| = 25 and |K| = 25, we have G = K. Thus, G is generated by a and b, with a^5 = e, b^5 = a^k, and b^25 = e. This means G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, Z_5 × Z_5.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic (isomorphic to Z_25) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5 (Z_5 × Z_5)."
