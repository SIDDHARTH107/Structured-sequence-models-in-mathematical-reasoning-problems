    "message_1": "A company produces two types of smartphones, model A and model B. The cost of producing one unit of model A is $100, and the cost of producing one unit of model B is $125. The company has a budget of $15,000 to produce smartphones. The company wants to produce at least 100 units of model A and at least 75 units of model B. The profit from selling one unit of model A is $200, and the profit from selling one unit of model B is $175. What is the optimal production quantity of each model to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of model A and y be the number of units of model B.\n\nThe cost of producing x units of model A and y units of model B should not exceed the budget of $15,000:\n100x + 125y ≤ 15,000\n\nThe company wants to produce at least 100 units of model A and at least 75 units of model B:\nx ≥ 100\ny ≥ 75\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\nP(x, y) = 200x + 175y\n\nTo find the optimal production quantity, we can use the constraints to find the feasible region and then analyze the profit function within that region.\n\nFirst, let's find the feasible region:\n\n100x + 125y ≤ 15,000\nx ≥ 100\ny ≥ 75\n\nNow, we can rewrite the first inequality to find the relationship between x and y:\n\n125y ≤ 15,000 - 100x\ny ≤ (15,000 - 100x) / 125\n\nSince x ≥ 100 and y ≥ 75, we can find the minimum and maximum values of x and y that satisfy the constraints:\n\nx_min = 100\ny_min = 75\n\nTo find the maximum values of x and y, we can use the inequality y ≤ (15,000 - 100x) / 125:\n\ny_max = (15,000 - 100 * 100) / 125 = 20\nx_max = (15,000 - 125 * 75) / 100 = 50\n\nNow, we have the feasible region for x and y:\n\n100 ≤ x ≤ 150\n75 ≤ y ≤ 95\n\nNow, we can analyze the profit function within this region. Since the profit function is linear, the maximum profit will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region. There are four vertices to consider:\n\n1. (x_min, y_min) = (100, 75)\n2. (x_min, y_max) = (100, 95)\n3. (x_max, y_min) = (150, 75)\n4. (x_max, y_max) = (150, 95) - This point is not within the feasible region because it doesn't satisfy the budget constraint.\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit at each vertex:\n\n1. P(100, 75) = 200 * 100 + 175 * 75 = 20,000 + 13,125 = $33,125\n2. P(100, 95) = 200 * 100 + 175 * 95 = 20,000 + 16,625 = $36,625\n3. P(150, 75) = 200 * 150 + 175 * 75 = 30,000 + 13,125 = $43,125\n\nThe maximum profit of $43,125 occurs when the company produces 150 units of model A and 75 units of model B."
