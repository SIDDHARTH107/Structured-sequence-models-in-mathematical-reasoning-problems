    "message_2": "First, let's treat the 2 people who must sit together as a single unit. So now, we have 4 units to arrange (the pair and the other 3 individuals).\n\nThere are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange these 4 units, which is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.\n\nNow, within the pair, there are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange the 2 people, which is 2! = 2 × 1 = 2 ways.\n\nSo, to find the total number of ways to seat the 5 people, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 4 units by the number of ways to arrange the people within the pair:\n\nTotal ways = 24 (arrangements of 4 units) × 2 (arrangements within the pair) = 48 ways."
