    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the curves y = 2x^2 and y = x^3 about the x-axis, we can use the method of washers. The volume V can be found using the following integral:\n\nV = π ∫[R(x)^2 - r(x)^2] dx\n\nwhere R(x) is the outer radius function and r(x) is the inner radius function. In this case, R(x) corresponds to the curve y = x^3 and r(x) corresponds to the curve y = 2x^2.\n\nFirst, we need to find the points of intersection of the two curves to determine the limits of integration. To do this, we set the two functions equal to each other:\n\n2x^2 = x^3\n\nx^3 - 2x^2 = 0\n\nx^2(x - 2) = 0\n\nThe points of intersection are x = 0 and x = 2. These will be our limits of integration.\n\nNow, we can set up the integral:\n\nV = π ∫[R(x)^2 - r(x)^2] dx\nV = π ∫[(x^3)^2 - (2x^2)^2] dx from 0 to 2\n\nV = π ∫[x^6 - 4x^4] dx from 0 to 2\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nV = π [ (1/7)x^7 - (4/5)x^5 ] from 0 to 2\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits of integration:\n\nV = π [ (1/7)(2^7) - (4/5)(2^5) - ( (1/7)(0^7) - (4/5)(0^5) ) ]\nV = π [ (1/7)(128) - (4/5)(32) ]\nV = π [ 128/7 - 128/5 ]\n\nTo find a common denominator, we can multiply the numerators and denominators by the appropriate factors:\n\nV = π [ (5)(128)/35 - (7)(128)/35 ]\nV = π [ (640 - 896)/35 ]\nV = π [ -256/35 ]\n\nSince volume cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nV = π [ 256/35 ]\n\nSo, the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the curves y = 2x^2 and y = x^3 about the x-axis is (256/35)π cubic units."
