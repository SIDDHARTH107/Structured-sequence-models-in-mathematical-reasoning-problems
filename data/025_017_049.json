    "message_2": "a) To find the singular points of the curve, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y, and find the points where both partial derivatives are zero.\n\nLet $f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x$. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -3x^2 - 8x - 3$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n$-3x^2 - 8x - 3 = 0$\n\n$2y = 0$\n\nThe second equation gives us $y = 0$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$-3x^2 - 8x - 3 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve for x:\n\n$x = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(-3)(-3)}}{2(-3)} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{28}}{-6}$\n\nSo, the singular points are $(\\frac{-8 + \\sqrt{28}}{-6}, 0)$ and $(\\frac{-8 - \\sqrt{28}}{-6}, 0)$.\n\nb) The given curve is a plane curve of degree 3 (since the highest degree term is $x^3$). For a plane curve of degree $d$, the canonical divisor class is given by $K_C = (d-3)C$, where $C$ is the class of a line. In this case, $d = 3$, so the canonical divisor class is $K_C = (3-3)C = 0$. The degree of the canonical divisor is the intersection number of the canonical divisor with the curve, which is $0$ in this case.\n\nc) A minimal model for a curve is a non-singular curve that is birationally equivalent to the given curve. Since the canonical divisor class is trivial (degree 0), the curve is already in its minimal model. So, the minimal model of the curve is the curve itself:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 + 4x^2 + 3x$"
