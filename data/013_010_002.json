    "message_1": "Consider two companies, Alpha and Beta, who produce similar products. The market demand for their product is given by the equation P = 30 - q, where P is the price per unit and q is the total quantity produced by both companies. Alpha and Beta have the same marginal cost which is $5 per unit. In a Cournot competition, both companies simultaneously choose their production quantity to maximize their profit. What will be the equilibrium quantity produced by each company and their corresponding profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantity produced by each company and their corresponding profit in a Cournot competition, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the reaction functions for both companies.\n2. Find the Nash equilibrium by solving the system of equations formed by the reaction functions.\n3. Calculate the equilibrium quantity produced by each company.\n4. Calculate the profit for each company.\n\nStep 1: Determine the reaction functions for both companies\n\nThe profit function for each company is given by:\n\nπ_i = (P - MC) * q_i, where π_i is the profit of company i, P is the price, MC is the marginal cost, and q_i is the quantity produced by company i.\n\nFor Alpha (A) and Beta (B), we have:\n\nπ_A = (30 - q - MC) * q_A\nπ_B = (30 - q - MC) * q_B\n\nSince the marginal cost is $5 for both companies, we can rewrite the profit functions as:\n\nπ_A = (25 - q) * q_A\nπ_B = (25 - q) * q_B\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to maximize the profit functions with respect to the quantity produced by each company. We can do this by taking the first derivative of the profit functions with respect to q_A and q_B and setting them equal to zero:\n\ndπ_A/dq_A = 25 - 2q_A - q_B = 0\ndπ_B/dq_B = 25 - 2q_B - q_A = 0\n\nThese are the reaction functions for Alpha and Beta.\n\nStep 2: Find the Nash equilibrium\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the reaction functions:\n\n25 - 2q_A - q_B = 0\n25 - 2q_B - q_A = 0\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nq_A = 5 + (1/3)q_B\nq_B = 5 + (1/3)q_A\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation:\n\nq_B = 5 + (1/3)(5 + (1/3)q_B)\n\nSolving for q_B, we get:\n\nq_B = 15/2 = 7.5\n\nSubstituting q_B back into the first equation:\n\nq_A = 5 + (1/3)(7.5) = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5\n\nStep 3: Calculate the equilibrium quantity produced by each company\n\nThe equilibrium quantity produced by each company is:\n\nq_A* = 7.5\nq_B* = 7.5\n\nStep 4: Calculate the profit for each company\n\nTo calculate the profit for each company, we can use the profit functions and the equilibrium quantities:\n\nπ_A* = (25 - (7.5 + 7.5)) * 7.5 = (25 - 15) * 7.5 = 10 * 7.5 = 75\nπ_B* = (25 - (7.5 + 7.5)) * 7.5 = (25 - 15) * 7.5 = 10 * 7.5 = 75\n\nSo, in the Cournot competition, both Alpha and Beta will produce 7.5 units each, and their corresponding profit will be $75 each."
