    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO\" using the Hill cipher with the given key matrix, we first need to convert the letters into numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25). Since the key matrix is 2x2, we will need to break the message into pairs of letters. If the message has an odd number of letters, we can add an extra letter (usually 'X') to make it even. In this case, the message is already even, so we don't need to add any extra letters.\n\nHELLO -> (H, E), (L, L), (O)\n\nNow, convert the letters to numbers:\n\n(H, E) -> (7, 4)\n(L, L) -> (11, 11)\n(O) -> (14)\n\nNext, we will multiply each pair of numbers by the key matrix:\n\n[3 5]   [7 ]   [ 66]\n[7 8] * [4] = [ 89]\n\n[3 5]   [11]   [ 86]\n[7 8] * [11] = [187]\n\n[3 5]   [14]   [ 97]\n[7 8] * [14] = [254]\n\nNow, we will take the results modulo 26 to get the encrypted pairs:\n\n[ 66]   [14]\n[ 89] % 26 = [11]\n\n[ 86]   [ 8]\n[187] % 26 = [23]\n\n[ 97]   [21]\n[254] % 26 = [ 4]\n\nFinally, convert the numbers back to letters:\n\n(14, 11) -> (O, L)\n(8, 23) -> (I, X)\n(21, 4) -> (V, E)\n\nThe encrypted message is \"OLIXVE\"."
