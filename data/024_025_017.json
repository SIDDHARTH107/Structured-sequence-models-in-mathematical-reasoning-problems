Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle over $X$ with the first Chern class $c_1(L) = k$, where $k$ is a fixed integer. \n\nDetermine the Chern classes of the holomorphic vector bundle $E = \\oplus_{j=1}^{n} L^{\\otimes j}$ over $X$.",
    "message_2": "To determine the Chern classes of the holomorphic vector bundle $E = \\oplus_{j=1}^{n} L^{\\otimes j}$ over $X$, we can use the Whitney sum formula for Chern classes. The Whitney sum formula states that for two vector bundles $E_1$ and $E_2$ over the same base space, the total Chern class of their direct sum is given by the product of their total Chern classes:\n\n$$c(E_1 \\oplus E_2) = c(E_1) \\cdot c(E_2).$$\n\nIn our case, we have $E = L^{\\otimes 1} \\oplus L^{\\otimes 2} \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus L^{\\otimes n}$. We can iteratively apply the Whitney sum formula to compute the total Chern class of $E$:\n\n$$c(E) = c(L^{\\otimes 1}) \\cdot c(L^{\\otimes 2}) \\cdots c(L^{\\otimes n}).$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the total Chern class of each $L^{\\otimes j}$. Since $L$ is a line bundle, its total Chern class is given by $c(L) = 1 + c_1(L)$. For the tensor product of line bundles, we have the following property:\n\n$$c_1(L^{\\otimes j}) = j \\cdot c_1(L).$$\n\nThus, the total Chern class of $L^{\\otimes j}$ is $c(L^{\\otimes j}) = 1 + j \\cdot c_1(L) = 1 + jk$. Now we can compute the total Chern class of $E$:\n\n$$c(E) = \\prod_{j=1}^{n} (1 + jk) = (1 + k)(1 + 2k) \\cdots (1 + nk).$$\n\nThe individual Chern classes $c_i(E)$ can be obtained by expanding the total Chern class as a polynomial in $k$. However, this expansion can be quite complicated, and there is no general closed-form expression for the individual Chern classes. In general, the first Chern class $c_1(E)$ will be the sum of the first Chern classes of the individual line bundles:\n\n$$c_1(E) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} jk = k \\sum_{j=1}^{n} j = k \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$"
