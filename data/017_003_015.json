Prove that there exists an element g in G such that the order of g is equal to p.",
    "message_2": "To prove that every group of prime order is cyclic, we will show that there exists an element g in G such that the order of g is equal to p.\n\nLet G be a group of prime order p. Since the order of G is p, there are p elements in G, including the identity element e. We will consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: There exists an element g in G such that the order of g is p.\n\nIn this case, we are done since we have found the element g with the desired property.\n\nCase 2: There is no element in G with order p.\n\nIn this case, we will show that this leads to a contradiction. Let g be any non-identity element in G. Since g is not the identity and its order is not p, the order of g must be a divisor of p. However, since p is prime, its only divisors are 1 and p itself. The order of g cannot be 1, as that would mean g is the identity element, which we have excluded. Therefore, the order of g must be p, which contradicts our assumption in Case 2.\n\nThus, there must exist an element g in G with order p. This means that the subgroup generated by g, denoted as ⟨g⟩, has p elements, since the order of an element is equal to the order of the cyclic subgroup it generates. Since G has p elements and ⟨g⟩ has p elements, it follows that G = ⟨g⟩. Therefore, G is a cyclic group generated by the element g."
