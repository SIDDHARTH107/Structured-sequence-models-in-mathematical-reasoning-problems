    "message_1": "In a game of Prisoner's Dilemma, two players can either cooperate or defect. If they both cooperate, each receives a payoff of $3. If one player defects and the other cooperates, the defector receives a payoff of $5 and the cooperator receives $0. If both players defect, they each receive a payoff of $1. \n\nSuppose player 1 always defects, and player 2 has a probability of 0.6 of cooperating and a probability of 0.4 of defecting. What is the expected payoff for player 2?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected payoff for player 2, we need to consider the probabilities of each possible outcome and the corresponding payoffs. Since player 1 always defects, there are only two possible outcomes for player 2: cooperating or defecting.\n\n1. Player 2 cooperates (probability = 0.6):\n   In this case, player 1 defects and player 2 cooperates, so the payoff for player 2 is $0.\n\n2. Player 2 defects (probability = 0.4):\n   In this case, both players defect, so the payoff for player 2 is $1.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected payoff for player 2 by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the corresponding payoff and summing the results:\n\nExpected payoff for player 2 = (0.6 * $0) + (0.4 * $1) = $0 + $0.4 = $0.4."
