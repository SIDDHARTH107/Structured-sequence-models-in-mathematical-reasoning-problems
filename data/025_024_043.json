Let G be the group of affine transformations of the plane that preserves this set of points. Find the dimension of the space of all G-invariant polynomials of degree 2 or less in the coordinates of the plane.",
    "message_2": "First, let's observe that the given set of points lie on a straight line. This is because the slope between any two consecutive points is the same: (4-2)/(3-1) = (6-4)/(5-3) = (8-6)/(7-5) = (10-8)/(9-7) = 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the space of all polynomials of degree 2 or less in the coordinates of the plane. This space has a basis given by {1, x, y, x^2, xy, y^2}. We want to find the dimension of the subspace of G-invariant polynomials.\n\nSince the points lie on a straight line, any affine transformation that preserves this set of points must also preserve the line. Therefore, any G-invariant polynomial must be constant on this line. In other words, if we plug in the coordinates of any of the points into the polynomial, we should get the same value.\n\nLet P(x, y) be a G-invariant polynomial. Then, we have:\n\nP(1, 2) = P(3, 4) = P(5, 6) = P(7, 8) = P(9, 10)\n\nNow, let's plug in the coordinates of the points into the basis polynomials:\n\n1. 1(1, 2) = 1(3, 4) = 1(5, 6) = 1(7, 8) = 1(9, 10) = 1\n2. x(1, 2) = 1, x(3, 4) = 3, x(5, 6) = 5, x(7, 8) = 7, x(9, 10) = 9\n3. y(1, 2) = 2, y(3, 4) = 4, y(5, 6) = 6, y(7, 8) = 8, y(9, 10) = 10\n4. x^2(1, 2) = 1, x^2(3, 4) = 9, x^2(5, 6) = 25, x^2(7, 8) = 49, x^2(9, 10) = 81\n5. xy(1, 2) = 2, xy(3, 4) = 12, xy(5, 6) = 30, xy(7, 8) = 56, xy(9, 10) = 90\n6. y^2(1, 2) = 4, y^2(3, 4) = 16, y^2(5, 6) = 36, y^2(7, 8) = 64, y^2(9, 10) = 100\n\nFrom the above calculations, we can see that only the constant polynomial 1 is invariant under the action of G. Therefore, the dimension of the space of all G-invariant polynomials of degree 2 or less in the coordinates of the plane is 1."
