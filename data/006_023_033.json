    "message_1": "In a market, 30% of customers purchase product X and 40% of customers purchase product Y. If a customer only purchases one of the two products, what is the probability that the customer will purchase product X?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the probability of purchasing product X as P(X) and the probability of purchasing product Y as P(Y). We are given that P(X) = 0.3 and P(Y) = 0.4. Since a customer only purchases one of the two products, the total probability of purchasing either product X or product Y is P(X) + P(Y) = 1.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of a customer purchasing product X given that they only purchase one of the two products. This can be represented as P(X | X or Y), which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP(X | X or Y) = P(X) / (P(X) + P(Y))\n\nPlugging in the given probabilities:\n\nP(X | X or Y) = 0.3 / (0.3 + 0.4) = 0.3 / 0.7 â‰ˆ 0.4286\n\nSo, the probability that a customer will purchase product X, given that they only purchase one of the two products, is approximately 42.86%."
