    "message_1": "Sure, here is a numerical problem related to Stream Ciphers:\n\nIf a plaintext message of length 16 is transmitted using a stream cipher and a keystream of length 8 is used to encrypt the message, how many bits does the ciphertext have?",
    "message_2": "In a stream cipher, the plaintext message is encrypted bit by bit using the keystream. The length of the ciphertext will be the same as the length of the plaintext message. In this case, the plaintext message has a length of 16 bits. Therefore, the ciphertext will also have a length of 16 bits."
