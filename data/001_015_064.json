    "message_2": "To solve for x, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$4^x = 2^6$\n\nSince $4 = 2^2$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n$(2^2)^x = 2^6$\n\nNow, we can use the power of a power rule, which states that $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$:\n\n$2^{2x} = 2^6$\n\nSince the bases are the same (both are 2), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n$2x = 6$\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n$x = \\frac{6}{2}$\n\n$x = 3$\n\nSo, the solution is $x = 3$."
