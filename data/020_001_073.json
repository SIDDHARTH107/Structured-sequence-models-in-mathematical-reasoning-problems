    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products A and B. The production of A requires 3 units of raw material and 2 units of labor, while B requires 2 units of raw material and 2 units of labor. The company has 180 units of raw material and 120 units of labor available. The profit per unit of A is $10, and for B it is $8. Find out the optimal production quantities of A and B that will maximize the total profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nThe constraints for raw materials and labor are as follows:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 180 (raw material constraint)\n2x + 2y ≤ 120 (labor constraint)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nP = 10x + 8y\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities to find the feasible region:\n\n1. Raw material constraint:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 180\ny ≤ (180 - 3x) / 2\n\n2. Labor constraint:\n\n2x + 2y ≤ 120\ny ≤ (120 - 2x) / 2\ny ≤ 60 - x\n\nNow we will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the constraint equations:\n\n1. Intersection of raw material constraint and labor constraint:\n\n3x + 2y = 180\n2x + 2y = 120\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation:\n\nx = 60\n\nSubstituting x = 60 into the labor constraint:\n\n2(60) + 2y = 120\ny = 0\n\nSo the intersection point is (60, 0).\n\n2. Intersection of raw material constraint and x-axis (y = 0):\n\n3x + 2(0) = 180\nx = 60\n\nSo the intersection point is (60, 0).\n\n3. Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x = 0):\n\n2(0) + 2y = 120\ny = 60\n\nSo the intersection point is (0, 60).\n\nNow we will evaluate the objective function P = 10x + 8y at each of the vertices:\n\n1. P(60, 0) = 10(60) + 8(0) = 600\n2. P(0, 60) = 10(0) + 8(60) = 480\n\nSince P(60, 0) = 600 is the maximum profit, the optimal production quantities are 60 units of product A and 0 units of product B."
