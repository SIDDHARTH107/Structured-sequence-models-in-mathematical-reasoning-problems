    "message_1": "A certain airport shuttle service has 20 passengers booked for its next trip. The probability that a passenger will be a business traveler is 0.4, and the probability that a passenger will be a leisure traveler is 0.6. What is the probability that at least 10 passengers on the shuttle will be leisure travelers?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 10 passengers on the shuttle will be leisure travelers, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(n, x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere P(x) is the probability of having x leisure travelers, C(n, x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, n is the total number of passengers (20), x is the number of leisure travelers, and p is the probability of a passenger being a leisure traveler (0.6).\n\nWe want to find the probability of having at least 10 leisure travelers, so we need to find the sum of probabilities for x = 10 to x = 20.\n\nP(at least 10 leisure travelers) = Σ P(x) for x = 10 to 20\n\n= P(10) + P(11) + ... + P(20)\n\nWe can calculate each term using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = C(20, x) * 0.6^x * 0.4^(20-x)\n\nNow, we calculate the probabilities for x = 10 to x = 20 and sum them up:\n\nP(at least 10 leisure travelers) = P(10) + P(11) + ... + P(20)\n= C(20, 10) * 0.6^10 * 0.4^10 + C(20, 11) * 0.6^11 * 0.4^9 + ... + C(20, 20) * 0.6^20 * 0.4^0\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the binomial probabilities, we get:\n\nP(at least 10 leisure travelers) ≈ 0.993630\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 passengers on the shuttle will be leisure travelers is approximately 0.9936 or 99.36%."
