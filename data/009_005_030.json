    "message_2": "To determine the charge on the capacitor after 1 second, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the RLC circuit. The characteristic equation for an RLC circuit is given by:\n\nL * (d^2q/dt^2) + R * (dq/dt) + (1/C) * q = 0\n\nwhere L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, and q is the charge on the capacitor.\n\nGiven the values of R, L, and C, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n0.1 * (d^2q/dt^2) + 10 * (dq/dt) + 20 * q = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve this second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The general solution for this type of equation is given by:\n\nq(t) = e^(-αt) * (A * cos(ωt) + B * sin(ωt))\n\nwhere α = R / (2 * L) and ω = sqrt((1 / (L * C)) - (R^2 / (4 * L^2)))\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nα = 10 / (2 * 0.1) = 50\nω = sqrt((1 / (0.1 * 0.05)) - (10^2 / (4 * 0.1^2))) = sqrt(200 - 625) = sqrt(-425)\n\nSince ω is imaginary, we have an overdamped system. In this case, the general solution is given by:\n\nq(t) = e^(-αt) * (A + B * t)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B using the initial conditions. At t = 0, the initial charge on the capacitor is given by:\n\nq(0) = V0 * C = 50 * 0.05 = 2.5 Coulombs\n\nPlugging in t = 0 into the general solution, we get:\n\n2.5 = e^(0) * (A + B * 0)\nA = 2.5\n\nNow, we need to find the initial current in the circuit. Since the switch is closed at t = 0, the initial current is given by:\n\ni(0) = -V0 / R = -50 / 10 = -5 A\n\nThe initial current is also related to the charge by:\n\ni(t) = dq(t) / dt\n\nTaking the derivative of the general solution with respect to time, we get:\n\ni(t) = e^(-αt) * (-α * (A + B * t) + B)\n\nPlugging in t = 0 and i(0) = -5, we get:\n\n-5 = e^(0) * (-50 * 2.5 + B)\nB = 120\n\nNow, we have the equation for the charge on the capacitor:\n\nq(t) = e^(-50t) * (2.5 + 120 * t)\n\nFinally, we can find the charge on the capacitor after 1 second by plugging in t = 1:\n\nq(1) = e^(-50 * 1) * (2.5 + 120 * 1) = e^(-50) * 122.5 ≈ 0 Coulombs\n\nSo, the charge on the capacitor after 1 second is approximately 0 Coulombs."
