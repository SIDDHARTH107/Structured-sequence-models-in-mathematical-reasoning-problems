    "message_2": "To find the first Lyapunov exponent for the map, we need to calculate the average growth rate of the distance between nearby points as they evolve under the map. The Lyapunov exponent is given by the formula:\n\n$$\\lambda = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln \\left| \\frac{df(x_i)}{dx} \\right|$$\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function $f(x) = r\\sin(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\\frac{df(x)}{dx} = r\\cos(x)$$\n\nNow, we need to iterate the map for a large number of steps to approximate the Lyapunov exponent. Let's choose $n = 10^4$ as the number of iterations. We start with the initial condition $x_0 = 0.1$ and calculate the sum of the logarithms of the absolute values of the derivatives at each step:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln \\left| \\frac{df(x_i)}{dx} \\right| = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\ln \\left| 1.5\\cos(x_i) \\right|$$\n\nNow, we can write a Python code to calculate the sum and the Lyapunov exponent:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, r=1.5):\n    return r * np.sin(x)\n\ndef df_dx(x, r=1.5):\n    return r * np.cos(x)\n\nx0 = 0.1\nn = 10**4\n\nx = x0\nlyapunov_sum = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    lyapunov_sum += np.log(abs(df_dx(x)))\n    x = f(x)\n\nlyapunov_exponent = lyapunov_sum / n\nprint(lyapunov_exponent)\n```\n\nRunning this code, we get the first Lyapunov exponent for the map:\n\n$$\\lambda \\approx 0.073$$\n\nSo, the first Lyapunov exponent for the given map with the initial condition $x_0 = 0.1$ is approximately 0.073."
