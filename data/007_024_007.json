    "message_2": "To compute the discrete logarithm of 5 with a base of 3 modulo 17, we are looking for an integer x such that:\n\n3^x ≡ 5 (mod 17)\n\nWe can find x by trying different values until we find one that satisfies the equation:\n\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n3^3 ≡ 10 (mod 17)\n3^4 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n3^5 ≡ 5 (mod 17)\n\nSo, the discrete logarithm of 5 with a base of 3 modulo 17 is x = 5."
