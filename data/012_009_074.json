    "message_2": "Yes, this degree sequence is possible. Here is one possible graph with this degree sequence:\n\n1. Label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.\n2. Connect A to B, C, and D (A has a degree of 3).\n3. Connect B to E and F (B has a degree of 3).\n4. Connect C to G (C has a degree of 2).\n5. Connect D to E (D has a degree of 2).\n6. E, F, and G are already connected to one vertex each, so they have a degree of 1.\n\nThe graph can be visualized as follows:\n\n```\n  A---B\n  |\\  |\\\n  | \\ | \\\n  |  \\|  \\\n  D---E   F\n   \\\n    \\\n     G\n```\n\nThis graph has the desired degree sequence {3,3,2,2,1,1,1}."
