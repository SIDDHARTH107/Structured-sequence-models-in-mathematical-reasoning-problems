Suppose that at each point $p \\in S^2$, the fiber of the bundle is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and that the bundle is trivial over the equator. If the Chern classes of the bundle are $c_1 = 0$ and $c_2 = -4$, determine the total Pontryagin number of the bundle.",
    "message_2": "To compute the total Pontryagin number of the bundle, we first need to find the Pontryagin classes of the bundle. Recall that for a rank 2 vector bundle $E$ over a manifold $M$, the total Pontryagin class is given by $p(E) = 1 + p_1(E)$, where $p_1(E)$ is the first Pontryagin class. \n\nThe first Pontryagin class is related to the Chern classes of the bundle by the following formula:\n\n$$p_1(E) = c_1^2(E) - 2c_2(E).$$\n\nGiven that $c_1(E) = 0$ and $c_2(E) = -4$, we can compute the first Pontryagin class:\n\n$$p_1(E) = 0^2 - 2(-4) = 8.$$\n\nNow we can compute the total Pontryagin number of the bundle, which is the integral of the total Pontryagin class over the sphere $S^2$. Since $S^2$ has dimension 2, only the constant term 1 in the total Pontryagin class contributes to the integral:\n\n$$\\int_{S^2} p(E) = \\int_{S^2} (1 + p_1(E)) = \\int_{S^2} 1 = \\text{Vol}(S^2).$$\n\nThe volume of the sphere $S^2$ is given by:\n\n$$\\text{Vol}(S^2) = 4\\pi r^2,$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the sphere. Since we are not given a specific radius, we can express the total Pontryagin number in terms of $r$:\n\n$$\\text{Total Pontryagin number} = 4\\pi r^2.$$"
