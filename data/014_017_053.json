    "message_1": "Suppose you are given a ciphertext in which the frequency of the letter \"e\" is twice the frequency of the letter \"t.\" If the total number of letters in the ciphertext is 1000, how many times does the letter \"e\" occur?",
    "message_2": "Let the frequency of the letter \"t\" be represented by the variable t. Since the frequency of the letter \"e\" is twice the frequency of the letter \"t,\" we can represent the frequency of the letter \"e\" as 2t.\n\nThe total number of letters in the ciphertext is 1000, so the combined frequency of the letters \"e\" and \"t\" is equal to 1000. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nt + 2t = 1000\n\nCombining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n3t = 1000\n\nNow, we can solve for t by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:\n\nt = 1000 / 3\nt â‰ˆ 333.33\n\nSince the frequency of a letter must be a whole number, we can round t to the nearest whole number, which is 333.\n\nNow that we have the frequency of the letter \"t,\" we can find the frequency of the letter \"e\" by multiplying t by 2:\n\ne = 2t\ne = 2 * 333\ne = 666\n\nSo, the letter \"e\" occurs 666 times in the ciphertext."
