    "message_2": "In a simple undirected graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, we have six vertices and seven edges, so the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 7 = 14.\n\nLet's denote the degrees of the six vertices as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, and d6. We have:\n\nd1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 = 14\n\nSince the graph has seven edges, at least one vertex must have a degree of at least 3. Without loss of generality, let's assume d1 â‰¥ 3. Now, we consider the following possibilities:\n\n1. If d1 = 3, then d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 = 11. In this case, we can have the degree sequence (3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2), which sums up to 14.\n\n2. If d1 = 4, then d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 = 10. In this case, we can have the degree sequence (4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1), which sums up to 14.\n\n3. If d1 = 5, then d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 = 9. In this case, we can't have a valid degree sequence, because the maximum degree for a vertex in a simple graph with six vertices is 5, and having another vertex with a degree of 4 would require more than seven edges.\n\n4. If d1 = 6, then d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 = 8. This case is not possible, because a vertex with a degree of 6 would be connected to all other vertices, making it a complete graph with 6 vertices, which would require 15 edges, more than the given 7 edges.\n\nTherefore, the possible degree sequences for the given graph G with six vertices and seven edges are (3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2) and (4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1)."
