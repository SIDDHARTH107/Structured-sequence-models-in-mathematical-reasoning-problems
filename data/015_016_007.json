    "message_2": "To find the maximum Lyapunov exponent for the Chua circuit with the given parameter values, we first need to obtain the equations that describe the circuit. The Chua circuit is a nonlinear electronic circuit that exhibits chaotic behavior, and its dynamics can be described by a set of three ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dV_C1}{dt} = \\frac{1}{L} (V_C2 - V_C1 - f(V_C1))\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{dV_C2}{dt} = \\frac{1}{R} (V_C1 - V_C2 + i_L)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{di_L}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{C_2} V_C2\n$$\n\nwhere $V_C1$ and $V_C2$ are the voltages across capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$, $i_L$ is the current through the inductor $L$, and $f(V_C1)$ is the nonlinear function of the voltage across $C_1$ given by:\n\n$$\nf(V_C1) = m_0 V_C1 + \\frac{1}{2}(m_1 - m_0)(|V_C1 + 1| - |V_C1 - 1|)\n$$\n\nIn this case, we have $m_0 = m_1 = m = -0.5$. Now, we can substitute the given parameter values into the equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dV_C1}{dt} = \\frac{1}{0.7} (V_C2 - V_C1 - f(V_C1))\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{dV_C2}{dt} = \\frac{1}{10} (V_C1 - V_C2 + i_L)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{di_L}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{220 \\times 10^{-9}} V_C2\n$$\n\nTo find the maximum Lyapunov exponent, we need to linearize these equations around an equilibrium point and compute the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. However, this process is quite involved and requires numerical methods to solve the equations and compute the Lyapunov exponent.\n\nThere is no closed-form expression for the maximum Lyapunov exponent, and it must be computed numerically. The value of the maximum Lyapunov exponent depends on the specific trajectory of the system and the initial conditions. In general, a positive maximum Lyapunov exponent indicates chaotic behavior, while a negative value indicates stable behavior.\n\nTo compute the maximum Lyapunov exponent for this specific Chua circuit, you would need to use specialized software or programming tools, such as MATLAB or Python, to numerically integrate the equations and compute the Lyapunov exponent."
