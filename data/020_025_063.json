The company wants to find the most efficient route to visit all the delivery locations and return to the starting point. The distance (in miles) between each location is given in the table below. What is the shortest possible distance of such a route?\n\n| Location | A | B | C | D | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A | 0 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 |\n| B | 3 | 0 | 6 | 7 | 3 |\n| C | 4 | 6 | 0 | 5 | 8 |\n| D | 2 | 7 | 5 | 0 | 9 |\n| E | 1 | 3 | 8 | 9 | 0 |",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible distance of such a route, we can use the brute force method to calculate the distance of all possible routes and choose the shortest one. There are 5 locations, so there are 5! (5 factorial) possible routes, which is 120. However, since the route is a cycle, we can divide this number by 5 to eliminate duplicates, which leaves us with 24 unique routes. Let's list all the possible routes starting and ending at location A:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-A\n2. A-B-C-E-D-A\n3. A-B-D-C-E-A\n4. A-B-D-E-C-A\n5. A-B-E-C-D-A\n6. A-B-E-D-C-A\n7. A-C-B-D-E-A\n8. A-C-B-E-D-A\n9. A-C-D-B-E-A\n10. A-C-D-E-B-A\n11. A-C-E-B-D-A\n12. A-C-E-D-B-A\n13. A-D-B-C-E-A\n14. A-D-B-E-C-A\n15. A-D-C-B-E-A\n16. A-D-C-E-B-A\n17. A-D-E-B-C-A\n18. A-D-E-C-B-A\n19. A-E-B-C-D-A\n20. A-E-B-D-C-A\n21. A-E-C-B-D-A\n22. A-E-C-D-B-A\n23. A-E-D-B-C-A\n24. A-E-D-C-B-A\n\nNow, let's calculate the distances for each route:\n\n1. 3+6+5+1 = 15\n2. 3+6+8+2 = 19\n3. 3+7+5+4 = 19\n4. 3+7+9+6 = 25\n5. 3+3+8+5 = 19\n6. 3+3+9+7 = 22\n7. 4+6+7+1 = 18\n8. 4+6+9+2 = 21\n9. 4+5+7+3 = 19\n10. 4+5+9+6 = 24\n11. 4+8+3+7 = 22\n12. 4+8+9+6 = 27\n13. 2+3+6+8 = 19\n14. 2+3+8+6 = 19\n15. 2+5+6+1 = 14\n16. 2+5+8+3 = 18\n17. 2+9+6+4 = 21\n18. 2+9+8+6 = 25\n19. 1+3+6+5 = 15\n20. 1+3+7+4 = 15\n21. 1+8+6+2 = 17\n22. 1+8+5+3 = 17\n23. 1+9+7+6 = 23\n24. 1+9+5+4 = 19\n\nThe shortest possible distance is 14 miles, which corresponds to the route A-D-C-B-E-A."
