    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 25,963 is divided by 9, we can use the divisibility rule for 9, which states that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. \n\nLet's find the sum of the digits of 25,963:\n\n2 + 5 + 9 + 6 + 3 = 25\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when 25 is divided by 9:\n\n25 รท 9 = 2 with a remainder of 7.\n\nSo, the remainder when 25,963 is divided by 9 is 7."
