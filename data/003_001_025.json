    "message_1": "Suppose the hypotenuse of a right triangle measures 15 cm and one of its legs measures 9 cm. What is the length of the other leg?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Let's denote the length of the other leg as 'a' and the given leg as 'b'. The hypotenuse is 'c'.\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nWe are given:\nb = 9 cm\nc = 15 cm\n\nNow we can plug these values into the equation:\n\na^2 + (9)^2 = (15)^2\na^2 + 81 = 225\n\nNow, we can solve for 'a':\n\na^2 = 225 - 81\na^2 = 144\na = âˆš144\na = 12\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 12 cm."
