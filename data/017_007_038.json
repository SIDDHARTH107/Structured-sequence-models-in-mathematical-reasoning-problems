    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will first analyze the possible elements in G and their orders. Since G has order 6, by Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of elements in G are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n1. There must be an identity element e in G with order 1.\n\n2. If there exists an element of order 6, then G is cyclic and generated by that element. In this case, G is isomorphic to C6.\n\nNow, let's assume there is no element of order 6 in G. Then, the remaining possible orders for elements in G are 2 and 3.\n\n3. There must be at least one element of order 2, say a. If not, all non-identity elements would have order 3, and G would be a group of order 6 with 3 elements of order 3, which is impossible since the number of elements of order 3 must be even (by Cauchy's theorem).\n\n4. There must be at least one element of order 3, say b. If not, all non-identity elements would have order 2, and G would be an abelian group, which contradicts our assumption that there is no element of order 6.\n\nNow, we have elements e, a, and b with orders 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Since G has 6 elements, there must be 3 more elements in G. Let's denote them as c, d, and f.\n\nWe know that a^2 = e and b^3 = e. Let's analyze the products of a and b:\n\nab ≠ e (since a ≠ b^2 and b ≠ a^2)\nab ≠ a (since b ≠ e)\nab ≠ b (since a ≠ e)\n\nSo, ab must be one of the remaining elements, say ab = c.\n\nNow, let's compute (ab)^2 = a(ba)b. We know that ba ≠ e, a, b, and c. So, ba must be one of the remaining elements, say ba = d. Then, (ab)^2 = a(ba)b = adb. Since a has order 2, a^2 = e, and we get adb = b. Thus, d = b^2.\n\nNow, let's compute (ab)^3 = (ab)(ab)^2 = c(adb) = cb^2. Since b has order 3, b^2 ≠ e, b, and b^3 = e. So, b^2 = d. Thus, cb^2 = cd. We know that cd ≠ e, c, and d. So, cd must be the last remaining element, say cd = f.\n\nNow we have all the elements of G: {e, a, b, c, d, f}. The group operation table for G is:\n\n```\n   e  a  b  c  d  f\ne  e  a  b  c  d  f\na  a  e  c  b  f  d\nb  b  d  e  f  c  a\nc  c  f  d  e  a  b\nd  d  b  f  a  e  c\nf  f  c  a  d  b  e\n```\n\nWe can see that G is non-abelian since, for example, ab = c ≠ d = ba. The generators of G are {a, b}, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D3, which is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 (if there exists an element of order 6) or the dihedral group D3 (if there is no element of order 6)."
