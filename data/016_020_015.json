    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as a Tetrix, is a fractal formed by recursively removing smaller tetrahedrons from a larger one. At each level, the number of small tetrahedrons removed is a power of 4.\n\nFor a level 4 Sierpinski tetrahedron, the total number of small tetrahedrons removed at each level is:\n\nLevel 1: 4^0 = 1\nLevel 2: 4^1 = 4\nLevel 3: 4^2 = 16\nLevel 4: 4^3 = 64\n\nTo find the total number of small tetrahedrons needed to construct a level 4 Sierpinski tetrahedron, we need to add the number of tetrahedrons removed at each level:\n\nTotal small tetrahedrons = 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 85\n\nSo, 85 small tetrahedrons are needed to construct a Sierpinski tetrahedron of level 4."
