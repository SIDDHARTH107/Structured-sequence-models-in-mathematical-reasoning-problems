    "message_1": "A building is located 300 meters away from a person. The angle of elevation from the person's eye level to the top of the building is 45 degrees. What is the height of the building in meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in a right triangle. The angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and the distance from the person to the building is 300 meters. Let h be the height of the building.\n\ntan(45) = h / 300\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = h / 300\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 300 * 1\n\nh = 300 meters\n\nThe height of the building is 300 meters."
