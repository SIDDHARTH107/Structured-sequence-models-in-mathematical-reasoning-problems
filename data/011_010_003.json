    "message_1": "A rock climber wants to climb a steep cliff. The cliff consists of 7 ledges and she wants to reach the top of the cliff by stepping on each of the ledges at least once. In how many ways can she climb the cliff, if she may not step twice on the same ledge in a row?",
    "message_2": "Let's use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let dp[i] be the number of ways the climber can reach the ith ledge without stepping on the same ledge twice in a row. \n\nBase case:\n- dp[1] = 1 (There is only one way to reach the first ledge)\n\nNow, let's find the recursive relation for dp[i]. To reach the ith ledge, the climber can come from any of the previous ledges except the (i-1)th ledge (to avoid stepping on the same ledge twice in a row). So, the climber can come from the (i-2)th ledge, (i-3)th ledge, ..., or the 1st ledge.\n\nTherefore, dp[i] = dp[i-2] + dp[i-3] + ... + dp[1].\n\nNow, we can compute dp[2], dp[3], ..., dp[7] using the recursive relation:\n\n- dp[2] = dp[1] = 1\n- dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 1 + 1 = 2\n- dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] + dp[1] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4\n- dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3] + dp[2] + dp[1] = 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8\n- dp[6] = dp[5] + dp[4] + dp[3] + dp[2] + dp[1] = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 16\n- dp[7] = dp[6] + dp[5] + dp[4] + dp[3] + dp[2] + dp[1] = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 ways for the climber to reach the top of the cliff by stepping on each of the ledges at least once without stepping on the same ledge twice in a row."
