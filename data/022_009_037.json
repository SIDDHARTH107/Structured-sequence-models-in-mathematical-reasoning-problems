    "message_2": "The power series representation of the function $f(z) = e^z$ at $z=0$ is given by the Maclaurin series:\n\n$$f(z) = e^z = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{z^n}{n!}$$\n\nTo determine the radius of convergence, we can use the ratio test. The ratio test states that if $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = L$, then the series converges if $L < 1$, diverges if $L > 1$, and is inconclusive if $L = 1$. In this case, $a_n = \\frac{z^n}{n!}$, so:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{z^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}}{\\frac{z^n}{n!}}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{z}{n+1}\\right|$$\n\nSince the limit does not depend on $z$, the radius of convergence is infinite. This means that the power series converges for all complex numbers $z$.\n\nNow, we want to find the sum of the power series at $z = 1$. Plugging $z = 1$ into the power series, we get:\n\n$$f(1) = e^1 = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1^n}{n!} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!}$$\n\nThis is the well-known series representation of the number $e$:\n\n$$e = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} = 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{24} + \\cdots$$\n\nSo, the sum of the power series at $z = 1$ is equal to $e \\approx 2.71828$."
