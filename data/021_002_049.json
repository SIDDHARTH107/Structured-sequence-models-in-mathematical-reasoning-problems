    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial guess vector, v0 = [1, 1, 1].\n2. Multiply the matrix A by the current guess vector, v0, to get a new vector, v1.\n3. Normalize v1 to get a unit vector.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the eigenvector converges (i.e., the difference between consecutive eigenvectors is very small).\n\nLet's perform the power iteration method:\n\nInitial guess vector, v0 = [1, 1, 1]\n\nIteration 1:\nv1 = A * v0 = [-35768, -126270, -189360]\nNormalize v1: v1_norm = [-0.1890, -0.6667, -1.0000]\n\nIteration 2:\nv2 = A * v1_norm = [  1.0000,   3.5263,   5.2632]\nNormalize v2: v2_norm = [ 0.1667,  0.5882,  0.8824]\n\nIteration 3:\nv3 = A * v2_norm = [-0.1890, -0.6667, -1.0000]\nNormalize v3: v3_norm = [-0.1890, -0.6667, -1.0000]\n\nSince v3_norm is the same as v1_norm, the eigenvector has converged. Now, we can find the dominant eigenvalue by multiplying the eigenvector with the matrix A and dividing by the eigenvector:\n\nDominant eigenvalue = (A * v3_norm) / v3_norm = [-0.1890, -0.6667, -1.0000]\n\nThus, the dominant eigenvalue is approximately -1, and the corresponding eigenvector is [-0.1890, -0.6667, -1.0000]."
