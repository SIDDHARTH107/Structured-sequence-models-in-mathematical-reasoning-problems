Based on the fuzzy logic analysis, the temperature can be classified as hot (H), warm (W), or cool (C) as follows:\n- If the temperature is between 20°C to 24°C, it is cool (C).\n- If the temperature is between 23°C to 27°C, it is warm (W).\n- If the temperature is between 26°C to 30°C, it is hot (H).\n\nIf the current temperature reading is 22.5°C, what is the degree of membership of the temperature in each category (C, W, H) based on the fuzzy logic classification?",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of membership for each category, we can use the following formulas:\n\nFor Cool (C):\nDegree of membership (C) = (24 - T) / (24 - 20), where T is the temperature.\n\nFor Warm (W):\nDegree of membership (W) = (T - 23) / (27 - 23), if T is between 23°C and 27°C.\n\nFor Hot (H):\nDegree of membership (H) = 0, since the temperature is not within the hot range.\n\nGiven the current temperature reading is 22.5°C, we can calculate the degree of membership for each category:\n\nDegree of membership (C) = (24 - 22.5) / (24 - 20) = 1.5 / 4 = 0.375\n\nSince 22.5°C is not within the warm range, the degree of membership for warm (W) is 0.\n\nDegree of membership (H) = 0, as the temperature is not within the hot range.\n\nSo, the degree of membership for the temperature 22.5°C in each category is:\n- Cool (C): 0.375\n- Warm (W): 0\n- Hot (H): 0"
