    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2x - 3y + 4$, we need to find the points where the gradient of the function is zero. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2y - 3$\n\nSetting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:\n\n$2x - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 1$\n\n$2y - 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nSo, the critical point is $(1, \\frac{3}{2})$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the index of this critical point. To do this, we compute the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe Hessian matrix is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are simply the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Both eigenvalues are positive, which means the critical point is a local minimum. In Morse theory, the index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. In this case, there are no negative eigenvalues, so the index of the critical point $(1, \\frac{3}{2})$ is 0."
