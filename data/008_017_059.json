    "message_2": "First, let's write the system in the form Ax = b.\n\nA = |  3   2   1  |\n    |  2  -2   4  |\n    | -1  1.5 -2  |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 15 |\n    |  3 |\n    | -7 |\n\nNow, we will use sparse matrix techniques to solve for x. Sparse matrix techniques are useful when the matrix A has many zero elements. However, in this case, the matrix A does not have many zero elements, so sparse matrix techniques are not particularly beneficial. Instead, we can use other methods such as Gaussian elimination or Cramer's rule to solve the system.\n\nUsing Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Add the first row multiplied by 1/3 to the third row:\n\nA = |  3   2    1  |\n    |  2  -2    4  |\n    |  0   2.5 -1  |\n\nb = | 15 |\n    |  3 |\n    | -2 |\n\n2. Subtract the first row multiplied by 2/3 from the second row:\n\nA = |  3   2    1  |\n    |  0  -4    2  |\n    |  0   2.5 -1  |\n\nb = | 15 |\n    | -7 |\n    | -2 |\n\n3. Divide the second row by -4:\n\nA = |  3   2    1  |\n    |  0   1   -0.5|\n    |  0   2.5 -1  |\n\nb = | 15 |\n    |  1.75 |\n    | -2 |\n\n4. Subtract the second row multiplied by 2.5 from the third row:\n\nA = |  3   2    1  |\n    |  0   1   -0.5|\n    |  0   0    0.25  |\n\nb = | 15 |\n    |  1.75 |\n    | -6.375 |\n\n5. Divide the third row by 0.25:\n\nA = |  3   2    1  |\n    |  0   1   -0.5|\n    |  0   0    1  |\n\nb = | 15 |\n    |  1.75 |\n    | -25.5 |\n\n6. Add the third row multiplied by 0.5 to the second row:\n\nA = |  3   2    1  |\n    |  0   1    0  |\n    |  0   0    1  |\n\nb = | 15 |\n    |  0.25 |\n    | -25.5 |\n\n7. Subtract the third row from the first row:\n\nA = |  3   2    0  |\n    |  0   1    0  |\n    |  0   0    1  |\n\nb = | 40.5 |\n    |  0.25 |\n    | -25.5 |\n\n8. Subtract the second row multiplied by 2 from the first row:\n\nA = |  3   0    0  |\n    |  0   1    0  |\n    |  0   0    1  |\n\nb = | 40 |\n    |  0.25 |\n    | -25.5 |\n\nFinally, divide the first row by 3:\n\nA = |  1   0    0  |\n    |  0   1    0  |\n    |  0   0    1  |\n\nb = | 13.3333 |\n    |  0.25   |\n    | -25.5   |\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\nx = 13.3333\ny = 0.25\nz = -25.5"
