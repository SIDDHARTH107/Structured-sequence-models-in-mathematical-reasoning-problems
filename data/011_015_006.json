    "message_1": "In a party with 6 people, every 2 people are either friends or strangers. What is the minimum number of pairs of friends, or the minimum number of pairs of strangers that must exist at the party?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. We will consider one person at the party and analyze their relationship with the other 5 people. There are two possibilities for each relationship: either they are friends or they are strangers.\n\nCase 1: The person has at least 3 friends among the other 5 people.\nIn this case, we will look at the relationships among these 3 friends. If any of these 3 friends are friends with each other, then we have a group of 3 friends (the original person and the two friends who are friends with each other). If none of these 3 friends are friends with each other, then they form a group of 3 strangers. In either case, we have a group of 3 friends or a group of 3 strangers.\n\nCase 2: The person has at least 3 strangers among the other 5 people.\nIn this case, we will look at the relationships among these 3 strangers. If any of these 3 strangers are friends with each other, then we have a group of 3 friends (the two strangers who are friends with each other and the person who is a stranger to both of them). If none of these 3 strangers are friends with each other, then they form a group of 3 strangers. In either case, we have a group of 3 friends or a group of 3 strangers.\n\nIn both cases, we have either a group of 3 friends or a group of 3 strangers. Since there are 6 people at the party, there are a total of (6 choose 2) = 15 pairs of people. If we have a group of 3 friends, there are (3 choose 2) = 3 pairs of friends, and if we have a group of 3 strangers, there are (3 choose 2) = 3 pairs of strangers. Therefore, the minimum number of pairs of friends or pairs of strangers that must exist at the party is 3."
