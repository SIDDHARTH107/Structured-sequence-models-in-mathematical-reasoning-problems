    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point (3, 4, -2), we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x, y, and z.\n\nThe equation of the surface is x² + y² + z² = 25. Let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 2x\n∂f/∂y = 2y\n∂f/∂z = 2z\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (3, 4, -2):\n\n∂f/∂x(3, 4, -2) = 2(3) = 6\n∂f/∂y(3, 4, -2) = 2(4) = 8\n∂f/∂z(3, 4, -2) = 2(-2) = -4\n\nThe gradient of the surface at the point (3, 4, -2) is given by the vector (6, 8, -4). This vector is also the normal vector to the tangent plane at that point.\n\nNow, we can use the point-normal form of the equation of a plane, which is given by:\n\nA(x - x₀) + B(y - y₀) + C(z - z₀) = 0\n\nwhere (A, B, C) is the normal vector and (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the point on the plane. In our case, (A, B, C) = (6, 8, -4) and (x₀, y₀, z₀) = (3, 4, -2). Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n6(x - 3) + 8(y - 4) - 4(z + 2) = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n6x + 8y - 4z = 50\n\nThis is the equation of the plane tangent to the surface at the point (3, 4, -2)."
