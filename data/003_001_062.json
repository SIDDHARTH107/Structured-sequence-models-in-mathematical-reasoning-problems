    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In other words:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nIn this case, the length of the hypotenuse (c) is 10, and the length of one leg (a) is 8. We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\n10^2 = 8^2 + b^2\n100 = 64 + b^2\n100 - 64 = b^2\n36 = b^2\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the other leg (b):\n\nâˆš36 = b\n6 = b\n\nSo, the length of the other leg is 6."
