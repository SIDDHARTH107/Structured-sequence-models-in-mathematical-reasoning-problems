    "message_2": "To find the diameter of the graph G, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. Since G is a simple graph, it has no loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum and minimum degree of the vertices in the graph. The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case:\n\nΣ(deg(v)) = 2 * 12 = 24\n\nSince there are 8 vertices, the average degree of a vertex is:\n\n24 / 8 = 3\n\nNow, let's consider the two extreme cases:\n\n1. Maximum degree: If one vertex has the maximum possible degree, it would be connected to all other 7 vertices. In this case, the diameter would be 1, as any other vertex can be reached in a single step.\n\n2. Minimum degree: If all vertices have at least the average degree (3), then the graph would be connected. In the worst-case scenario, the graph would be a tree (acyclic connected graph) with one vertex having a degree of 4 and the other 7 vertices having a degree of 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, and 1. In this case, the diameter would be the longest path in the tree, which is 4.\n\nSince the graph has 12 edges, which is more than the minimum number of edges required for a connected graph with 8 vertices (7 edges for a tree), the graph must be connected. Therefore, the diameter of G is between 1 and 4.\n\nTo find the exact diameter, we can use the inequality relating the diameter (D), order (n), and size (m) of a connected graph:\n\nm ≥ (n - 1)(n - 2)/2 - (n - 1 - D)(n - 2 - D)/2\n\nPlugging in the values for our graph (n = 8, m = 12):\n\n12 ≥ (8 - 1)(8 - 2)/2 - (8 - 1 - D)(8 - 2 - D)/2\n\nSolving for D, we get:\n\nD ≤ 2\n\nSince the graph is connected and has more than 7 edges, the diameter of G cannot be 1. Therefore, the diameter of G is 2."
