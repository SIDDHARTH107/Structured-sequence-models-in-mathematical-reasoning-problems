    "message_1": "If a trigonometric function is given by f(x) = 3 cos (2x - π/3), find the amplitude and period of the function.",
    "message_2": "The given function is f(x) = 3 cos(2x - π/3).\n\nThe general form of a cosine function is A cos(Bx - C), where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift.\n\nIn our case, A = 3, B = 2, and C = π/3.\n\nThe amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is |3| = 3.\n\nThe period of the function is given by the formula P = 2π/B. In our case, B = 2, so the period is P = 2π/2 = π.\n\nSo, the amplitude of the function is 3, and the period is π."
