    "message_1": "In a manufacturing process, the probability of producing a defective product is 0.05. If a company produces 500 products, what is the probability that exactly 25 of them will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defective products\n- n is the total number of products produced (in this case, 500)\n- x is the number of defective products (in this case, 25)\n- p is the probability of producing a defective product (in this case, 0.05)\n- nCx is the number of combinations of choosing x items from a set of n items, which can be calculated as n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(25) = (500C25) * (0.05^25) * (0.95^475)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 500C25:\n\n500C25 = 500! / (25! * (500-25)!)\n= 500! / (25! * 475!)\n= 2.456845e+22 (approx.)\n\nNow, let's calculate (0.05^25) and (0.95^475):\n\n0.05^25 = 9.313226e-34 (approx.)\n0.95^475 = 1.798862e-10 (approx.)\n\nNow, multiply all the values together:\n\nP(25) = 2.456845e+22 * 9.313226e-34 * 1.798862e-10\n= 4.079e-21 (approx.)\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 25 defective products out of 500 is approximately 4.079e-21."
