    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn this case, we have a complete graph with 7 vertices, denoted as K7. In a complete graph, each vertex is connected to every other vertex. The degree of each vertex in K7 is 6 (since it is connected to all other 6 vertices).\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index χ'(G) of a graph G is either its maximum degree Δ(G) or Δ(G) + 1. In other words, χ'(G) ∈ {Δ(G), Δ(G) + 1}.\n\nFor K7, the maximum degree Δ(K7) is 6. So, the chromatic index χ'(K7) is either 6 or 7.\n\nHowever, it is known that the chromatic index of a complete graph with an odd number of vertices is equal to the number of vertices. Therefore, the chromatic index of K7 is 7."
