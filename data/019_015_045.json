    "message_2": "To prove that there exists a natural number that cannot be expressed as the sum of three cubes of integers, we will use a proof by contradiction. We will assume that every natural number can be expressed as the sum of three cubes of integers, and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume that for every natural number n, there exist integers a, b, and c such that:\n\nn = a^3 + b^3 + c^3\n\nNow, consider the natural number 4. If our assumption is true, then there must exist integers a, b, and c such that:\n\n4 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3\n\nHowever, we know that the cube of any integer is either of the form 0 (mod 9), 1 (mod 9), or -1 (mod 9). This is because:\n\n0^3 ≡ 0 (mod 9)\n1^3 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n(-1)^3 ≡ -1 (mod 9)\n2^3 ≡ 8 ≡ -1 (mod 9)\n(-2)^3 ≡ -8 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 0 (mod 9)\n\nSince the cube of any integer is either of the form 0 (mod 9), 1 (mod 9), or -1 (mod 9), the sum of three cubes of integers can only be of the form 0 (mod 9), 1 (mod 9), 2 (mod 9), -1 (mod 9), or -2 (mod 9). However, 4 is not of any of these forms modulo 9:\n\n4 ≢ 0 (mod 9)\n4 ≢ 1 (mod 9)\n4 ≢ 2 (mod 9)\n4 ≢ -1 (mod 9)\n4 ≢ -2 (mod 9)\n\nThis contradicts our assumption that every natural number can be expressed as the sum of three cubes of integers. Therefore, there exists a natural number (in this case, 4) that cannot be expressed as the sum of three cubes of integers."
