    "message_1": "A factory produces batches of 500 light bulbs. The manager wants to know the percentage of defective bulbs produced, but inspecting all the bulbs is too time-consuming. The manager takes a random sample of 50 bulbs from each batch and inspects them. If a bulb is defective, it is replaced and not counted again. After inspecting a sample of 50 bulbs, the manager found that 3 bulbs were defective. What is the estimated percentage of defective bulbs in the batch?",
    "message_2": "To estimate the percentage of defective bulbs in the batch, we can use the proportion of defective bulbs found in the sample.\n\nIn the sample of 50 bulbs, 3 were found to be defective. So, the proportion of defective bulbs in the sample is:\n\n3 defective bulbs / 50 bulbs = 0.06\n\nTo express this proportion as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n0.06 * 100 = 6%\n\nSo, the estimated percentage of defective bulbs in the batch is 6%."
