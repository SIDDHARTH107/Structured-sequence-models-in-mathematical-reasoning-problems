    "message_2": "To disconnect a connected graph, we need to remove enough edges such that there is no path between at least two vertices. In other words, we need to create at least two separate components.\n\nA connected graph with n vertices is a tree if it has n-1 edges. In our case, a tree with 7 vertices would have 6 edges. Since our graph has 10 edges, it is not a tree and must contain at least one cycle.\n\nTo disconnect the graph, we can try to create two separate components, each of which is a tree. Let's say the first component has k vertices and the second component has 7-k vertices. Then, the number of edges in the first component would be k-1 and the number of edges in the second component would be (7-k)-1 = 6-k.\n\nThe total number of edges in the two components would be (k-1) + (6-k) = 5. Since our graph has 10 edges, we need to remove 10 - 5 = 5 edges to disconnect the graph and create two separate components, each of which is a tree."
