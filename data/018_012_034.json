Therefore, (A × B) ∩ A = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nNext, let's find B ∩ (A × B):\n\nSimilarly, B contains only single elements and A × B contains ordered pairs, so there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, B ∩ (A × B) = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nNow, let's check if the Cartesian product is associative with respect to intersection:\n\n(A × B) ∩ A = ∅\nB ∩ (A × B) = ∅\n\nSince both expressions result in the empty set, it might seem that the Cartesian product is associative with respect to intersection. However, this is not a general proof, as it only holds for this specific example. In fact, the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to intersection, as we will demonstrate with a counterexample.\n\nConsider the following sets:\n\nA = {1}\nB = {2}\nC = {3}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) × C and A × (B × C):\n\n(A × B) × C = {((1,2),3)}\nA × (B × C) = {(1,(2,3))}\n\nNow, let's find ((A × B) × C) ∩ A and A ∩ (A × (B × C)):\n\n((A × B) × C) ∩ A = ∅\nA ∩ (A × (B × C)) = ∅\n\nIn this case, both expressions result in the empty set, but the Cartesian products themselves are not equal:\n\n(A × B) × C ≠ A × (B × C)\n\nThis counterexample demonstrates that the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to intersection."
