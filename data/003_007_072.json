    "message_2": "To find the smallest angle in the triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and angles A, B, and C opposite those sides, respectively:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nWe want to find the smallest angle, so we will look for the angle opposite the shortest side, which is 7. Let's call this angle A. Then, a = 7, b = 9, and c = 10. Plugging these values into the Law of Cosines formula, we get:\n\n10^2 = 7^2 + 9^2 - 2 * 7 * 9 * cos(A)\n\n100 = 49 + 81 - 126 * cos(A)\n\n100 = 130 - 126 * cos(A)\n\n-30 = -126 * cos(A)\n\ncos(A) = 30/126\n\nNow, we can use the inverse cosine function to find the angle A:\n\nA = arccos(30/126)\n\nA â‰ˆ 78.46 degrees\n\nThe smallest angle in the triangle is approximately 78.46 degrees."
