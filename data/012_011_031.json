    "message_2": "a) In the given graph G, a cut vertex is a vertex whose removal (along with its incident edges) would increase the number of connected components in the graph. Similarly, a bridge is an edge whose removal would increase the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nCut vertices: {2, 4, 7}\nBridges: {(1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 5)}\n\nb) If we add a new edge between vertices 7 and 9, the graph becomes:\n\n```\n     1 -- 2 -- 3\n    /          |\n   4 -- 5      |\n   |    /      |\n   |   /       |\n   6 -- 7 -----8\n        \\\n         9\n```\n\nNow, let's identify the new cut vertices and bridges of the updated graph:\n\nCut vertices: {2, 7}\nBridges: {(1, 2), (2, 3), (7, 9)}\n\nBy adding the new edge between vertices 7 and 9, vertex 4 is no longer a cut vertex, and the bridge (4, 5) is no longer a bridge."
