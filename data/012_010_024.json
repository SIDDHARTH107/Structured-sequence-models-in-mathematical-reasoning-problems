    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum size of a vertex cover is the smallest number of vertices needed to cover all the edges.\n\nIn this graph, we can choose the vertices {2, 4, 6} as a vertex cover:\n\n- Vertex 2 covers edges (1, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 5).\n- Vertex 4 covers edges (1, 4) and (4, 5).\n- Vertex 6 covers edges (3, 6) and (5, 6).\n\nNo other vertex cover has fewer vertices, so the minimum size of a vertex cover for this graph is 3."
