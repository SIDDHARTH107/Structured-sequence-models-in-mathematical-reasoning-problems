    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of this graph such that no two adjacent edges have the same color, we can use the concept of edge chromatic number. The edge chromatic number is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges of a graph so that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn this graph, the maximum degree (the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex) is 4, which occurs at vertices A and B. According to Vizing's theorem, the edge chromatic number is either equal to the maximum degree or one more than the maximum degree. So, the edge chromatic number for this graph is either 4 or 5.\n\nNow, let's try to color the edges using 4 colors:\n\n```\nColor 1: A-B\nColor 2: A-C, B-D\nColor 3: A-D, B-E\nColor 4: A-E, C-D, C-E\n```\n\nWith these color assignments, no two adjacent edges share the same color. Therefore, the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of this graph such that no two adjacent edges have the same color is 4."
