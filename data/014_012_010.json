The corresponding letters are encoded by the row and column values of the Vigenere cipher table. For example, the first letter of the plaintext, \"M\", and the first letter of the key, \"C\", correspond to the cipher letter \"P\".",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Vigenere cipher with the key \"CODE\", we will use the given table to find the corresponding ciphertext.\n\n1. First letter: M (plaintext) and C (key)\n   - Find the row with C and the column with M: P\n2. Second letter: A (plaintext) and O (key)\n   - Since O is not in the table, we will use its equivalent in the table, which is D (O - A = 14, D is the 4th letter)\n   - Find the row with D and the column with A: D\n3. Third letter: T (plaintext) and D (key)\n   - Since T is not in the table, we will use its equivalent in the table, which is G (T - A = 19, G is the 7th letter)\n   - Find the row with D and the column with G: K\n4. Fourth letter: H (plaintext) and E (key)\n   - Find the row with E and the column with H: M\n\nSo, the corresponding ciphertext for the message \"MATH\" with the key \"CODE\" is \"PDKM\"."
