    "message_2": "To prove that there is no integer solution to the equation x^2 - 3y^2 = 7, we can proceed by contradiction. Let's assume that there is an integer solution (x, y) to the equation.\n\nNow, consider the equation modulo 3. That is, we will look at the equation in terms of the remainders when x and y are divided by 3. The equation becomes:\n\nx^2 - 3y^2 ≡ 7 (mod 3)\n\nSince 7 ≡ 1 (mod 3), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx^2 - 3y^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nNow, let's consider the possible remainders of x and y when divided by 3. There are three possibilities: 0, 1, and 2. We can analyze the squares of these remainders modulo 3:\n\n0^2 ≡ 0 (mod 3)\n1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n2^2 ≡ 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom this, we can see that the square of an integer modulo 3 is either 0 or 1. Therefore, x^2 ≡ 0 or x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\n\nNow, let's analyze the equation x^2 - 3y^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3) for each case:\n\n1. If x^2 ≡ 0 (mod 3), then x^2 - 3y^2 ≡ 0 - 3y^2 ≡ -3y^2 (mod 3). Since -3 ≡ 0 (mod 3), this implies that -3y^2 ≡ 0 (mod 3), which is a contradiction because we assumed x^2 - 3y^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3).\n\n2. If x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3), then x^2 - 3y^2 ≡ 1 - 3y^2 (mod 3). For this to be true, we need 1 - 3y^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3), which implies that 3y^2 ≡ 0 (mod 3). This means that y^2 must be a multiple of 3, so y^2 ≡ 0 (mod 3). However, we showed earlier that the square of an integer modulo 3 is either 0 or 1, so this case also leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince both cases lead to contradictions, we can conclude that there is no integer solution (x, y) to the equation x^2 - 3y^2 = 7."
