If we define a relation R on S x P as follows: (a, p) R (b, q) if and only if a + q = b + p, then how many pairs of elements are in the equivalence class [(1,2)]?",
    "message_2": "To find the equivalence class [(1,2)], we need to find all pairs (a, p) and (b, q) in S x P such that (a, p) R (b, q) and (1, 2) R (a, p). \n\nRecall that S is the set of natural numbers less than or equal to 20, and P is the set of prime numbers less than or equal to 20. So, S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 20} and P = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}.\n\nNow, we have the relation (1, 2) R (a, p) if and only if 1 + 2 = a + p, which simplifies to a + p = 3. Since p is a prime number, the only possible value for p is 2 (the smallest prime number). This gives us a = 1.\n\nSo, the only pair (a, p) that satisfies the relation with (1, 2) is (1, 2) itself. Now, we need to find all pairs (b, q) such that (1, 2) R (b, q).\n\nWe have the relation (1, 2) R (b, q) if and only if 1 + 2 = b + q, which simplifies to b + q = 3. Let's consider all possible values for q in P and find the corresponding values for b:\n\n1. If q = 2, then b = 1.\n2. If q = 3, then b = 0 (which is not in S, so this pair is not valid).\n3. If q = 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19, then b would be negative (which is not in S, so these pairs are not valid).\n\nThus, the only valid pair (b, q) is (1, 2). Therefore, the equivalence class [(1,2)] contains only one pair, which is (1, 2)."
