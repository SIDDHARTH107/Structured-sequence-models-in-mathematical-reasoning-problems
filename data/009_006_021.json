    "message_2": "This problem involves a second-order reaction, as the rate depends on the concentrations of both reactants A and B. The general form of a second-order rate equation is:\n\nrate = k [A]^m [B]^n\n\nwhere m and n are the orders of the reaction with respect to reactants A and B, respectively. In this case, m = n = 1, so the rate equation becomes:\n\nrate = k [A] [B]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the concentrations of A and B as the reaction progresses. We can do this by setting up a differential equation:\n\nd[A]/dt = -k [A] [B]\n\nSince [B] = [B]_0 - [A] + [A]_0 (because B is consumed as A is consumed, and the initial concentration of A is [A]_0), we can rewrite the differential equation as:\n\nd[A]/dt = -k [A] ([B]_0 - [A] + [A]_0)\n\nNow, we can separate variables and integrate:\n\n∫(d[A]/([A]([B]_0 - [A] + [A]_0))) = -∫(k dt)\n\nLet's integrate both sides:\n\n∫(d[A]/([A]([B]_0 - [A] + [A]_0))) = -k ∫(dt)\n\nNow, we can integrate from t = 0 to t = 30 min and [A] = [A]_0 to [A] = [A]_t:\n\n∫([A]_0 to [A]_t) (d[A]/([A]([B]_0 - [A] + [A]_0))) = -k ∫(0 to 30 min) (dt)\n\nLet's call the left side integral I:\n\nI = ∫(d[A]/([A]([B]_0 - [A] + [A]_0)))\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let u = [B]_0 - [A] + [A]_0, so du = -d[A]. The integral becomes:\n\nI = -∫(du/(u([A]_0 - u)))\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nI = -∫(du/u) = -ln|u|\n\nNow, we can substitute back for u:\n\nI = -ln|([B]_0 - [A] + [A]_0)|\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n- ln|([B]_0 - [A]_t + [A]_0)| + ln|([B]_0 - [A]_0 + [A]_0)| = -k (30 min)\n\nSimplifying and solving for [A]_t:\n\nln|([B]_0 - [A]_t + [A]_0)| - ln|[B]_0| = -k (30 min)\n\nln|([B]_0 - [A]_t + [A]_0)/[B]_0| = -k (30 min)\n\n([B]_0 - [A]_t + [A]_0)/[B]_0 = e^(-k (30 min))\n\n[B]_0 - [A]_t + [A]_0 = [B]_0 e^(-k (30 min))\n\n[A]_t = [B]_0 - [B]_0 e^(-k (30 min)) + [A]_0 - [B]_0\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n\n[A]_t = 0.05 - 0.05 e^(-0.0075 (30)) + 0.10 - 0.05\n\n[A]_t ≈ 0.05 - 0.05 e^(-0.225) + 0.05\n\n[A]_t ≈ 0.05 - 0.05 (0.798) + 0.05\n\n[A]_t ≈ 0.05 - 0.0399 + 0.05\n\n[A]_t ≈ 0.0601 M\n\nSo, the concentration of A after 30 minutes of the reaction is approximately 0.0601 M."
