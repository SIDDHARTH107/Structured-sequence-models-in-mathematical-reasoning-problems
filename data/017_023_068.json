    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 72. We know that 72 = 2^3 * 3^2. By the Sylow theorems, we can find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups in G.\n\nLet n_2 and n_3 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, respectively. By Sylow's theorem, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3^2 = 9, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 2^3 = 8, and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom condition 1, n_2 can be 1 or 9. From condition 2, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, both of which are normal in G. Let P_2 and P_3 be these subgroups. Then G is the internal direct product of P_2 and P_3, i.e., G ≅ P_2 × P_3. Since P_2 has order 8 and P_3 has order 9, G is isomorphic to C8 × C9, which is isomorphic to C72 (the cyclic group of order 72).\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, which is normal in G. Let P_2 be this subgroup. Since P_2 has order 8, it is isomorphic to one of the five groups of order 8: C8, C4 × C2, D4, Q, or Dic4. Let P_3 be any Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Then the order of P_3 is 9, so P_3 is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3. \n\nBy considering the possible semi-direct products of P_2 and P_3, we can construct several non-abelian groups of order 72. In particular, there are 51 non-abelian groups of order 72 that can be formed in this way.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is normal in G. Let P_3 be this subgroup. Since P_3 has order 9, it is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3. Let P_2 be any Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then the order of P_2 is 8, so P_2 is isomorphic to one of the five groups of order 8: C8, C4 × C2, D4, Q, or Dic4. \n\nBy considering the possible semi-direct products of P_2 and P_3, we can construct several non-abelian groups of order 72. In particular, there are 51 non-abelian groups of order 72 that can be formed in this way.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, G has no unique Sylow subgroups. However, we can still consider the possible semi-direct products of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, we can construct the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2.\n\nIn summary, G can be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C72, the alternating group A4 × C3 × C2, or one of the 51 non-abelian groups of order 72."
