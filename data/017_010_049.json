    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C10, D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10, we will first analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems and then examine the elements and subgroups of G.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G, denoted by n_p, satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. n_p divides the order of G (in this case, 10).\n2. n_p is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n3. All Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other.\n\nSince the order of G is 10, we have two prime factors: 2 and 5. We will now find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nFor the Sylow 2-subgroups, we have p = 2. The possible values of n_2 are 1 and 5 (since they both divide 10). However, n_2 must also be congruent to 1 modulo 2, so n_2 = 1. Therefore, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup of G, which is of order 2.\n\nFor the Sylow 5-subgroups, we have p = 5. The possible values of n_5 are 1 and 2 (since they both divide 10). However, n_5 must also be congruent to 1 modulo 5, so n_5 = 1. Therefore, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup of G, which is of order 5.\n\nNow, let P be the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2 and Q be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. Since both P and Q are normal in G (as they are the unique subgroups of their respective orders), their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 2 * 5 = 10. Thus, PQ = G.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible structures for G:\n\n1. If G is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to C10. In this case, G has an element of order 10, and all other non-identity elements have orders that divide 10.\n\n2. If G is not cyclic, then G must have elements of order 2 and 5 (from the Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 5-subgroup, respectively). Let a be an element of order 2 and b be an element of order 5. Since G is not cyclic, the order of the product ab cannot be 10. Thus, (ab)^2 or (ab)^5 must be the identity element.\n\nIf (ab)^2 is the identity, then G is isomorphic to D5, the dihedral group of order 10. In this case, G has elements of order 2 (rotations) and order 5 (reflections), and the group operation can be described by the relations a^2 = b^5 = (ab)^2 = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nIf (ab)^5 is the identity, then G is a non-abelian group of order 10. In this case, G has elements of order 2 and 5, and the group operation can be described by the relations a^2 = e, b^5 = e, and (ab)^5 = e.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10. The specific isomorphism depends on the properties of the elements and subgroups of G."
