The wave function of the particle is given by $\\psi(x,0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2a}}$, where $a$ is the width of the well. Solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation to find the probability density function of the particle for $t>0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, we first need to write down the equation itself. For a particle of mass m in a potential V(x), the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is given by:\n\n$$\ni\\hbar\\frac{\\partial\\psi(x,t)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} + V(x)\\psi(x,t)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\\psi(x,t)$ is the wave function of the particle at position x and time t. In our case, the mass m = 2 kg, and the potential V(x) = 10x^2.\n\nSince the potential is time-independent, we can use the separation of variables technique to solve the Schrödinger equation. We assume that the wave function can be written as a product of a spatial part and a temporal part:\n\n$$\n\\psi(x,t) = \\phi(x)T(t)\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the Schrödinger equation, we get:\n\n$$\ni\\hbar\\phi(x)\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2}T(t) + 10x^2\\phi(x)T(t)\n$$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $\\phi(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{i\\hbar}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m\\phi(x)}\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} + 10x^2\n$$\n\nThe left-hand side depends only on time, and the right-hand side depends only on position. Since these are independent variables, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call E (the energy eigenvalue):\n\n$$\n\\frac{i\\hbar}{T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = E\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m\\phi(x)}\\frac{d^2\\phi(x)}{dx^2} + 10x^2\\phi(x) = E\\phi(x)\n$$\n\nThe first equation is a simple first-order ordinary differential equation for T(t):\n\n$$\n\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{iE}{\\hbar}T(t)\n$$\n\nThe solution is:\n\n$$\nT(t) = e^{-\\frac{iEt}{\\hbar}}\n$$\n\nThe second equation is a time-independent Schrödinger equation for the harmonic oscillator potential. Solving this equation is more involved and requires the use of ladder operators or Hermite polynomials. However, since we are given the initial wave function $\\psi(x,0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2a}}$, we can assume that this is an eigenstate of the time-independent Schrödinger equation with a corresponding energy eigenvalue E.\n\nNow, we can write the full wave function as:\n\n$$\n\\psi(x,t) = \\phi(x)e^{-\\frac{iEt}{\\hbar}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2a}}$.\n\nFinally, the probability density function is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function:\n\n$$\nP(x,t) = |\\psi(x,t)|^2 = \\phi(x)^2 = \\frac{1}{2a}\n$$\n\nSince the initial wave function is time-independent, the probability density function remains constant for all times t > 0."
