    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape constructed by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. The construction process for a Menger sponge starts with a cube divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3). In the first iteration (level 1), the center cube of each face and the center cube of the entire structure are removed, leaving 20 cubes.\n\nFor each subsequent level, the same process is applied to each remaining cube. So, for level 2, each of the 20 cubes from level 1 is divided into 27 smaller cubes, and the same cubes are removed as before. This results in 20 * (20) = 400 cubes.\n\nFor level 3, the same process is applied to each of the 400 cubes from level 2. This results in 20 * (400) = 8,000 cubes.\n\nSo, a Menger sponge of level 3 requires a total of 8,000 cubes."
