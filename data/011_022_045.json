    "message_1": "A thief has broken into a store with the intention of stealing items. He has a knapsack that can hold a maximum weight of 15 kg. The store has several items with different weights as follows:\n\n- Item 1: 6 kg, Value $30\n- Item 2: 3 kg, Value $14\n- Item 3: 4 kg, Value $16\n- Item 4: 2 kg, Value $9\n- Item 5: 5 kg, Value $20\n\nWhat is the maximum value the thief can carry in his knapsack without exceeding its weight limit, considering that he can only take one item of each kind?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value the thief can carry without exceeding the weight limit, we need to determine the combination of items that provide the highest value while staying within the 15 kg weight limit.\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to calculate the value-to-weight ratio for each item and then prioritize the items based on this ratio.\n\nValue-to-weight ratios:\n- Item 1: $30/6 kg = $5/kg\n- Item 2: $14/3 kg = $4.67/kg\n- Item 3: $16/4 kg = $4/kg\n- Item 4: $9/2 kg = $4.5/kg\n- Item 5: $20/5 kg = $4/kg\n\nNow, let's prioritize the items based on their value-to-weight ratio:\n\n1. Item 1: 6 kg, $30\n2. Item 4: 2 kg, $9\n3. Item 2: 3 kg, $14\n4. Item 3: 4 kg, $16\n5. Item 5: 5 kg, $20\n\nStart by adding the highest priority item (Item 1) to the knapsack:\n\n- Current weight: 6 kg\n- Current value: $30\n\nNext, add the second-highest priority item (Item 4):\n\n- Current weight: 6 kg + 2 kg = 8 kg\n- Current value: $30 + $9 = $39\n\nContinue adding items based on priority, ensuring the weight limit is not exceeded:\n\n- Add Item 2:\n  - Current weight: 8 kg + 3 kg = 11 kg\n  - Current value: $39 + $14 = $53\n\n- Attempt to add Item 3:\n  - Current weight: 11 kg + 4 kg = 15 kg\n  - Current value: $53 + $16 = $69\n\nSince adding Item 3 would exactly meet the weight limit and not exceed it, the thief can take Items 1, 2, 3, and 4 for a total value of $69."
