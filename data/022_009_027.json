    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence of the power series $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}$, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = L$, then the series converges if $L < 1$, diverges if $L > 1$, and is inconclusive if $L = 1$.\n\nIn our case, the general term of the series is $a_n = \\frac{x^n}{n!}$. Let's find the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}}{\\frac{x^n}{n!}}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{x^{n+1}n!}{x^n(n+1)!}\\right|$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{x}{n+1}\\right|$$\n\nAs $n$ goes to infinity, the expression $\\frac{x}{n+1}$ goes to 0 for any finite value of $x$. Therefore, the limit is 0, which is less than 1. This means that the power series converges for all values of $x$ in the complex plane.\n\nThus, the radius of convergence is infinite, and the interval of convergence is the entire complex plane."
