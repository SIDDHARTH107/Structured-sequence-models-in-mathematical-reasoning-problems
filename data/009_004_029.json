    "message_2": "To find the expression for displacement of the mass as a function of time, we can use the equation for simple harmonic motion:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ω * t + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement at time t, A is the amplitude of the motion, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nFirst, we need to find the angular frequency ω. This can be found using the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and m is the mass. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nω = sqrt(100 N/m / 3 kg) = sqrt(100/3) = 10/sqrt(3) rad/s\n\nNow, we need to find the amplitude A and the phase angle φ. Since the mass is initially displaced 5 cm (0.05 m) from its equilibrium position and set in motion, the initial conditions are:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ) = 0.05 m\nv(0) = -A * ω * sin(φ) = 0 m/s\n\nSince the velocity is 0 at t = 0, this means that the mass is at its maximum displacement, so sin(φ) = 0. Therefore, φ = 0 or φ = π. Since x(0) is positive, we choose φ = 0. Thus, the amplitude A is equal to the initial displacement:\n\nA = 0.05 m\n\nNow we can write the expression for the displacement of the mass as a function of time:\n\nx(t) = 0.05 * cos(10/sqrt(3) * t)"
