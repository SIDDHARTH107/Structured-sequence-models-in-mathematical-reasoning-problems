    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(2x + 1) + 3 = 5, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the radical term.\nSubtract 3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n√(2x + 1) = 5 - 3\n√(2x + 1) = 2\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n\n(√(2x + 1))^2 = 2^2\n2x + 1 = 4\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x = 4 - 1\n2x = 3\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution to the radical equation √(2x + 1) + 3 = 5 is x = 3/2."
