    "message_1": "A ball attached to a vertical spring is dropped from a certain height. The spring has a constant k = 3 N/m and the ball has an initial velocity of 5 m/s. The motion of the ball is described by the differential equation y'' + 3y' + 3y = 0, where y is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nCalculate the Lyapunov exponent for this system and determine whether or not the system exhibits chaos.",
    "message_2": "The given differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. It can be written as:\n\ny'' + 3y' + 3y = 0\n\nTo find the Lyapunov exponent, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the given differential equation. The characteristic equation is given by:\n\nr^2 + 3r + 3 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nr = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 3, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nr = (-3 ± √(3^2 - 4*1*3)) / 2*1\nr = (-3 ± √(9 - 12)) / 2\nr = (-3 ± √(-3)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we have complex roots:\n\nr = -3/2 ± (√3/2)i\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent (λ) is given by the real part of the complex roots:\n\nλ = -3/2\n\nSince the Lyapunov exponent is negative, the system is stable and does not exhibit chaos. A positive Lyapunov exponent would indicate a chaotic system, while a negative exponent indicates stability. In this case, the system is stable and does not exhibit chaos."
