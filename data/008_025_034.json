    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n2x + 3y = 7.5\n\nNow, we can see that the two equations are:\n\n2x + 3y = 8\n2x + 3y = 7.5\n\nSince both equations have the same left-hand side but different right-hand sides, they cannot be true at the same time. Therefore, this system of linear equations has no solution."
