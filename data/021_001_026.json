    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we'll first write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  5 ]\n[ 3 -4  5 | -5 ]\n[ 2  1  3 |  4 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nWe'll use the first row as the pivot row. Multiply the first row by -3 and add it to the second row:\n\n```\n-3 * [ 1  2 -1 |  5 ] + [ 3 -4  5 | -5 ] = [ 0 -10  8 | -20 ]\n```\n\nMultiply the first row by -2 and add it to the third row:\n\n```\n-2 * [ 1  2 -1 |  5 ] + [ 2  1  3 |  4 ] = [ 0 -3  5 | -6 ]\n```\n\nNow the augmented matrix looks like this:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  5 ]\n[ 0 -10  8 | -20 ]\n[ 0 -3  5 | -6 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nWe'll use the second row as the pivot row. First, divide the second row by -10 to simplify:\n\n```\n[ 0 -10  8 | -20 ] / -10 = [ 0  1 -0.8 |  2 ]\n```\n\nNow, multiply the second row by 3 and add it to the third row:\n\n```\n3 * [ 0  1 -0.8 |  2 ] + [ 0 -3  5 | -6 ] = [ 0  0  2.4 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow the augmented matrix looks like this:\n\n```\n[ 1  2  -1  |  5 ]\n[ 0  1 -0.8 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0  2.4 |  0 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nDivide the third row by 2.4:\n\n```\n[ 0  0  2.4 |  0 ] / 2.4 = [ 0  0  1 |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow we have z = 0.\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nSubstitute z into the second row:\n\n```\ny - 0.8 * 0 = 2\n```\n\nSo, y = 2.\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nSubstitute y and z into the first row:\n\n```\nx + 2 * 2 - 0 = 5\n```\n\nSo, x = 1.\n\nThe solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 0."
