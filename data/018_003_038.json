    "message_2": "The union of set A and set B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. In this case, A ∪ B = {2, 3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, we need to show that the resulting set {2, 3, 5, 7} is a superset of both set A and set B. A set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nFor set A:\n- 2 is in {2, 3, 5, 7}\n- 3 is in {2, 3, 5, 7}\n- 5 is in {2, 3, 5, 7}\n\nFor set B:\n- 3 is in {2, 3, 5, 7}\n- 5 is in {2, 3, 5, 7}\n- 7 is in {2, 3, 5, 7}\n\nSince every element of set A and set B is also an element of the resulting set {2, 3, 5, 7}, we can conclude that {2, 3, 5, 7} is a superset of both set A and set B."
