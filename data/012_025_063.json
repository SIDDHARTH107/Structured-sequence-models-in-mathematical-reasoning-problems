    "message_2": "To determine if the graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle, we need to find a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F, corresponding to the rows and columns of the adjacency matrix.\n\nWe can start by trying to find a Hamiltonian cycle manually:\n\n1. Start at vertex A: A\n2. Move to vertex B (since AB is connected): A -> B\n3. Move to vertex C (since BC is connected): A -> B -> C\n4. Move to vertex D (since CD is connected): A -> B -> C -> D\n5. Move to vertex F (since DF is connected): A -> B -> C -> D -> F\n6. Move to vertex E (since EF is connected): A -> B -> C -> D -> F -> E\n7. Return to vertex A (since AE is connected): A -> B -> C -> D -> F -> E -> A\n\nWe found a Hamiltonian cycle: A -> B -> C -> D -> F -> E -> A. Therefore, the graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle."
