    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection. In other words, A Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nGiven A = {2, 4, 6, 8} and B = {1, 3, 4, 7}, let's first find the union (A ∪ B) and intersection (A ∩ B) of the sets.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8} (all unique elements from both sets)\nA ∩ B = {4} (elements common to both sets)\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference A Δ B:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8} - {4} = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of set B and set A (B Δ A):\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection of sets are commutative (A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A), we have:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8} - {4} = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}\n\nComparing the results, we see that A Δ B = B Δ A = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}. This demonstrates that the symmetric difference of set A and set B is equal to the symmetric difference of set B and set A, which is consistent with the set theory rules."
