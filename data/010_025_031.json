Let $\\Sigma$ be a compact oriented surface with boundary, and let $M$ be a closed oriented $3$-manifold. \n\nCompute the dimension of the vector space $Z(\\Sigma \\times M)$, where $\\Sigma \\times M$ denotes the product manifold of $\\Sigma$ and $M$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the vector space $Z(\\Sigma \\times M)$, we will use the properties of TQFTs and the structure of the product manifold $\\Sigma \\times M$.\n\nFirst, recall that a TQFT is a functor that assigns to each closed oriented $d$-manifold $M$ a complex number $Z(M)$, and to each $(d-1)$-manifold $\\Sigma$ with boundary a vector space $Z(\\Sigma)$. In our case, $d=3$.\n\nNow, consider the product manifold $\\Sigma \\times M$. Since $\\Sigma$ is a compact oriented surface with boundary and $M$ is a closed oriented $3$-manifold, their product is a $3$-manifold with boundary. The boundary of $\\Sigma \\times M$ is given by $\\partial(\\Sigma \\times M) = (\\partial \\Sigma) \\times M$. \n\nBy the axioms of TQFTs, we have the following relation:\n\n$$Z(\\Sigma \\times M) = Z(\\partial(\\Sigma \\times M)) = Z((\\partial \\Sigma) \\times M).$$\n\nNow, let's consider the boundary $\\partial \\Sigma$. Since $\\Sigma$ is a compact oriented surface, its boundary is a disjoint union of circles. Let $n$ be the number of boundary components of $\\Sigma$. Then, we can write $\\partial \\Sigma = \\bigcup_{i=1}^n S^1_i$, where $S^1_i$ are circles.\n\nThe product manifold $(\\partial \\Sigma) \\times M$ is the disjoint union of $n$ copies of $S^1 \\times M$. Using the disjoint union property of TQFTs, we have:\n\n$$Z((\\partial \\Sigma) \\times M) = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n Z(S^1_i \\times M).$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the dimensions of the vector spaces $Z(S^1_i \\times M)$. Since $S^1_i$ is a circle and $M$ is a closed oriented $3$-manifold, their product $S^1_i \\times M$ is a closed oriented $3$-manifold. By the axioms of TQFTs, we have:\n\n$$Z(S^1_i \\times M) = \\dim Z(S^1_i \\times M).$$\n\nLet $d_i = \\dim Z(S^1_i \\times M)$. Then, the dimension of the vector space $Z(\\Sigma \\times M)$ is given by the sum of the dimensions of the vector spaces $Z(S^1_i \\times M)$:\n\n$$\\dim Z(\\Sigma \\times M) = \\sum_{i=1}^n d_i.$$\n\nIn general, the dimensions $d_i$ depend on the specific TQFT and the manifolds $\\Sigma$ and $M$. However, this expression gives a general formula for the dimension of the vector space $Z(\\Sigma \\times M)$ in terms of the dimensions of the vector spaces associated with the boundary components of $\\Sigma$."
