    "message_2": "To find the length of the opposite side of the triangle, we can use the sine function in the context of the given right triangle. The sine function is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, we have:\n\nsin(30°) = opposite_side / 2\n\nWe know that sin(30°) = 1/2 (from the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle or using a calculator). Now we can solve for the opposite side:\n\n1/2 = opposite_side / 2\n\nTo isolate the opposite_side, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n2 * (1/2) = opposite_side\n\n1 = opposite_side\n\nSo, the length of the opposite side of the triangle is 1."
