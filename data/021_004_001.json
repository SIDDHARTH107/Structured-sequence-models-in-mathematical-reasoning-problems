    "message_2": "The forward difference method is a numerical method used to estimate the derivative of a function. It is based on the idea of approximating the derivative by the slope of a nearby secant line. The formula for the forward difference method is:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h\n\nwhere f'(x) is the estimated derivative of the function f(x) at the point x, and h is the step size.\n\nGiven the function f(x) = x^2 and the point x = 2, we want to estimate the derivative at this point using a step size of h = 0.1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2 + 0.1) - f(2)) / 0.1\n\nFirst, we need to find the values of f(2 + 0.1) and f(2):\n\nf(2 + 0.1) = (2 + 0.1)^2 = 2.1^2 = 4.41\nf(2) = 2^2 = 4\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (4.41 - 4) / 0.1 = 0.41 / 0.1 = 4.1\n\nSo, using the forward difference method with a step size of h = 0.1, the estimated derivative of f(x) = x^2 at x = 2 is approximately 4.1."
