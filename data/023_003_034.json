    "message_1": "A metal bar of length 10 cm is initially at a temperature of 20°C. The ends of the bar are maintained at a fixed temperature of 0°C. At t=0, the temperature of the bar is raised to 100°C and it is left to cool. Using the Fourier series method, determine the temperature distribution of the bar at a time t=2 seconds. Assume that the thermal conductivity of the bar is 100 units and its density is 50 units. Furthermore, assume that the specific heat of the bar is 25 units.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x, t) is the temperature distribution of the bar, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x and t are the position along the bar and time, respectively. The thermal diffusivity α is given by:\n\nα = k / (ρ * c)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density, and c is the specific heat. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\nα = 100 / (50 * 25) = 0.08\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier series solution of the heat equation with the given boundary and initial conditions:\n\nBoundary conditions: u(0, t) = u(10, t) = 0\nInitial condition: u(x, 0) = 100 - 20 = 80\n\nThe Fourier series solution of the heat equation is given by:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [B_n * sin(n * π * x / L) * exp(-α * (n * π / L)² * t)]\n\nwhere L is the length of the bar, B_n are the Fourier coefficients, and n is an integer. To find the Fourier coefficients, we need to use the initial condition:\n\n80 = Σ [B_n * sin(n * π * x / 10)]\n\nWe can find the Fourier coefficients using the following formula:\n\nB_n = (2 / L) * ∫[u(x, 0) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx] from 0 to L\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB_n = (1 / 5) * ∫[80 * sin(n * π * x / 10) dx] from 0 to 10\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\nB_n = (400 / (n * π)) * (-1)^((n - 1) / 2) for odd n\nB_n = 0 for even n\n\nNow, we can plug the Fourier coefficients back into the Fourier series solution:\n\nu(x, t) = Σ [(400 / (n * π)) * (-1)^((n - 1) / 2) * sin(n * π * x / 10) * exp(-0.08 * (n * π / 10)² * 2)] for odd n\n\nSince the series converges quickly, we can approximate the solution by taking the first few terms of the series. Let's take the first 5 odd terms (n = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9):\n\nu(x, 2) ≈ Σ [(400 / (n * π)) * (-1)^((n - 1) / 2) * sin(n * π * x / 10) * exp(-0.08 * (n * π / 10)² * 2)] for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\n\nThis expression gives the temperature distribution of the bar at t = 2 seconds."
