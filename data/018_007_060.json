    "message_2": "The power set of X, denoted as P(X), is the set of all possible subsets of X, including the empty set and X itself. To find the number of elements in the power set of X, we can consider that each element of X has two possibilities: either it is in a subset or it is not. Therefore, for n elements, there are 2^n possible combinations of subsets, which is the cardinality of the power set of X.\n\nNow, let's prove that the cardinality of the power set of X is always greater than n. We will use a proof by contradiction.\n\nAssume that the cardinality of the power set of X is less than or equal to n, i.e., |P(X)| ≤ n. Since we know that |P(X)| = 2^n, this implies that 2^n ≤ n.\n\nHowever, this inequality does not hold for any positive integer n. For example, when n = 1, 2^1 > 1, and for n = 2, 2^2 > 2. Moreover, as n increases, the inequality becomes even more false, since the function 2^n grows exponentially faster than the linear function n.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that |P(X)| ≤ n is incorrect, and we can conclude that the cardinality of the power set of X is always greater than n."
