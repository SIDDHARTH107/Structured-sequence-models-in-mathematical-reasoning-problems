    "message_2": "To solve for x, we will first get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by (x - 2):\n\n(3x + 1)/(x - 2) * (x - 2) = 2 * (x - 2)\n\nThe (x - 2) on the left side of the equation will cancel out:\n\n3x + 1 = 2 * (x - 2)\n\nNow, distribute the 2 on the right side of the equation:\n\n3x + 1 = 2x - 4\n\nNext, subtract 2x from both sides of the equation:\n\n3x - 2x + 1 = 2x - 2x - 4\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx + 1 = -4\n\nFinally, subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx + 1 - 1 = -4 - 1\n\nThis gives us the solution:\n\nx = -5"
