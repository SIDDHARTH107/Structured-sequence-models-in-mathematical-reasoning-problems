    "message_1": "What is the number of line segments required to draw a dragon curve of order 7?\n\nNote: The dragon curve of order 0 consists of a single line segment. To obtain the curve of order 1, you need to take the curve of order 0 and replace the line segment with two smaller ones arranged in a zigzag pattern. In general, to obtain the curve of order n, you need to take the curve of order n-1 and apply a similar zigzag pattern to each line segment.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of line segments required to draw a dragon curve of order 7, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^n\n\nwhere n is the order of the dragon curve.\n\nSo for a dragon curve of order 7, the number of line segments required is:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^7 = 128"
