    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution, elimination, or matrices. In this case, we will use the method of matrices.\n\nFirst, we will write the given system of equations in matrix form:\n\n```\n[ 2  3 -4 |  1 ]\n[ 5  2  1 | 10 ]\n[ 3 -4  2 |  5 ]\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to obtain the row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n\n```\n[ 5  2  1 | 10 ]\n[ 2  3 -4 |  1 ]\n[ 3 -4  2 |  5 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 2 with (-2/5) * Row 1 + Row 2:\n\n```\n[  5   2    1  |  10 ]\n[  0   2.6 -4.4 | -3  ]\n[  3  -4    2   |   5  ]\n```\n\n3. Replace Row 3 with (-3/5) * Row 1 + Row 3:\n\n```\n[  5   2    1  |  10 ]\n[  0   2.6 -4.4 | -3  ]\n[  0  -6.6  1.4 | -11 ]\n```\n\n4. Divide Row 2 by 2.6:\n\n```\n[  5   2    1  |  10 ]\n[  0   1 -1.692| -1.154]\n[  0  -6.6  1.4 | -11 ]\n```\n\n5. Replace Row 3 with (6.6) * Row 2 + Row 3:\n\n```\n[  5   2    1  |  10 ]\n[  0   1 -1.692| -1.154]\n[  0   0 -9.6  | -18.6]\n```\n\n6. Divide Row 3 by -9.6:\n\n```\n[  5   2    1  |  10 ]\n[  0   1 -1.692| -1.154]\n[  0   0   1   |   1.938]\n```\n\nNow that we have the row-echelon form, we can perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. z = 1.938\n2. y = -1.154 + 1.692 * z = -1.154 + 1.692 * 1.938 ≈ 2.308\n3. x = (10 - 2 * y - z) / 5 = (10 - 2 * 2.308 - 1.938) / 5 ≈ 1.077\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is approximately:\n\n[x, y, z] = [1.077, 2.308, 1.938]"
