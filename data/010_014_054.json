    "message_1": "Consider a closed orientable surface $S$ with genus $g$ and let $H^n(S;\\mathbb{Z})$ denote the singular cohomology group of $S$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$. If $n = 2$, what is the dimension of $H^2(S;\\mathbb{Z})$ in terms of the genus $g$?",
    "message_2": "For a closed orientable surface $S$ of genus $g$, we can compute its cohomology groups using the fact that it is a CW complex with $2g+2$ vertices, $3g+1$ edges, and $1$ face. We can then use the cellular cohomology to compute the cohomology groups.\n\nThe cellular chain complex for $S$ is given by:\n\n$$0 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{d_2} \\mathbb{Z}^{3g+1} \\xrightarrow{d_1} \\mathbb{Z}^{2g+2} \\rightarrow 0$$\n\nwhere $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the boundary maps. Since $S$ is a closed orientable surface, we have $H^0(S;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H^1(S;\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}^{2g}$.\n\nNow, we want to compute the dimension of $H^2(S;\\mathbb{Z})$. To do this, we need to compute the kernel and image of the boundary maps. Since $d_1$ is surjective, its image is $\\mathbb{Z}^{2g+2}$. The kernel of $d_2$ is the cohomology group we are interested in, $H^2(S;\\mathbb{Z})$. Since the image of $d_1$ is equal to the kernel of $d_2$, we have:\n\n$$\\text{dim}(H^2(S;\\mathbb{Z})) = \\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(d_2)) = \\text{dim}(\\text{im}(d_1)) = 2g+2 - (3g+1) = -g+1$$\n\nHowever, this result seems incorrect, as the dimension of a cohomology group should be non-negative. The mistake lies in the fact that we computed the dimension of the kernel of $d_2$ by subtracting the dimensions of the domain and image of $d_1$. This is not the correct way to compute the dimension of the kernel of $d_2$.\n\nInstead, we should use the fact that the Euler characteristic of a closed orientable surface of genus $g$ is given by:\n\n$$\\chi(S) = 2 - 2g$$\n\nThe Euler characteristic can also be computed as the alternating sum of the dimensions of the cohomology groups:\n\n$$\\chi(S) = \\text{dim}(H^0(S;\\mathbb{Z})) - \\text{dim}(H^1(S;\\mathbb{Z})) + \\text{dim}(H^2(S;\\mathbb{Z}))$$\n\nPlugging in the known dimensions of $H^0(S;\\mathbb{Z})$ and $H^1(S;\\mathbb{Z})$, we get:\n\n$$2 - 2g = 1 - 2g + \\text{dim}(H^2(S;\\mathbb{Z}))$$\n\nSolving for the dimension of $H^2(S;\\mathbb{Z})$, we find:\n\n$$\\text{dim}(H^2(S;\\mathbb{Z})) = 1$$\n\nSo the dimension of $H^2(S;\\mathbb{Z})$ is $1$, independent of the genus $g$."
