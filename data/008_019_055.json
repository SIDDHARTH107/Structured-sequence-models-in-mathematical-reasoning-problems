    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, multiply the second equation by 3 and the third equation by -1:\n\n(3)(x - 3y + 4z) = (3)(-1)\n(-1)(3x + 2y - 7z) = (-1)(-5)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n3x - 9y + 12z = -3\n-3x - 2y + 7z = 5\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n-11y + 19z = 2  (1)\n\nNext, let's eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, multiply the first equation by -3 and the third equation by 2:\n\n(-3)(2x + 5y - z) = (-3)(7)\n(2)(3x + 2y - 7z) = (2)(-5)\n\nWhich results in:\n\n-6x - 15y + 3z = -21\n6x + 4y - 14z = -10\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n-11y - 11z = -31  (2)\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n\n-11y + 19z = 2   (1)\n-11y - 11z = -31 (2)\n\nTo eliminate y, add equation (1) and equation (2):\n\n8z = -29\n\nNow, solve for z:\n\nz = -29/8\n\nNow, substitute the value of z back into equation (1):\n\n-11y + 19(-29/8) = 2\n\n-11y - 551/8 = 2\n\n-11y = 2 + 551/8\n\n-11y = 559/8\n\ny = -559/88\n\nNow, substitute the values of y and z back into the original first equation:\n\n2x + 5(-559/88) - (-29/8) = 7\n\n2x - 2795/88 + 29/8 = 7\n\n2x = 7 + 2795/88 - 29/8\n\n2x = 7 + 2236/88\n\n2x = 7 + 251/11\n\n2x = 278/11\n\nx = 139/11\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy all three equations are:\n\nx = 139/11\ny = -559/88\nz = -29/8"
