    "message_2": "To determine the winner, we can use the concept of \"winning\" and \"losing\" positions. A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win, while a losing position is one where the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming optimal play from both players.\n\nLet's analyze the possible positions:\n\n1. If there is only 1 stone left, the current player can take it and win. So, this is a winning position.\n2. If there are 2 or 3 stones left, the current player can take 1 or 2 stones, leaving the other player with a losing position (1 stone). So, these are winning positions.\n3. If there are 4 stones left, the current player can take 1, 2, or 5 stones, but taking 5 is not possible. Taking 1 or 2 stones will leave the other player with a winning position (2 or 3 stones). So, this is a losing position.\n4. If there are 5, 6, or 7 stones left, the current player can take 1, 2, or 5 stones, leaving the other player with a losing position (4 stones). So, these are winning positions.\n5. If there are 8 stones left, the current player can take 1, 2, or 5 stones, but taking 5 is not possible. Taking 1 or 2 stones will leave the other player with a winning position (6 or 7 stones). So, this is a losing position.\n6. If there are 9, 10, or 11 stones left, the current player can take 1, 2, or 5 stones, leaving the other player with a losing position (8 stones). So, these are winning positions.\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging: every 4th position (4, 8, 12, 16, etc.) is a losing position, and the other positions are winning positions.\n\nSince the game starts with 20 stones, it is a winning position for the first player. Assuming optimal play from both players, the first player would win the game."
