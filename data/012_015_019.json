    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or not, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 7 vertices, so a connected graph would need at least 6 edges. Since we have 9 edges, it is possible that the graph is connected.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there are any isolated vertices or disconnected components. A simple undirected graph with 7 vertices can have at most 7 * (7 - 1) / 2 = 21 edges. Since we have 9 edges, there are 12 \"missing\" edges. If there were a disconnected component with only one vertex, it would require 6 \"missing\" edges, which is not enough to account for all 12 missing edges.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of having two connected components. If there were two connected components, one with 4 vertices and the other with 3 vertices, the maximum number of edges would be:\n\n4 * (4 - 1) / 2 + 3 * (3 - 1) / 2 = 6 + 3 = 9\n\nSince this is equal to the number of edges we have, it is possible that the graph has two connected components, one with 4 vertices and the other with 3 vertices. Therefore, the graph is not connected, and it has 2 connected components."
