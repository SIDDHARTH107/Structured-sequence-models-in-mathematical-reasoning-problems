    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function ((2x+8)/(x-4)) as x approaches 4, we can first try to simplify the function.\n\nThe function is:\n\n(2x + 8) / (x - 4)\n\nWe can factor out a 2 from the numerator:\n\n2(x + 4) / (x - 4)\n\nNow, we can see that as x approaches 4, both the numerator and denominator approach 0. This is an indeterminate form, so we need to do more work to find the limit.\n\nSince we can't directly substitute x = 4 into the function, we can try to cancel out the common factor (x + 4) in the numerator and denominator. However, there is no common factor in this case, so we can't simplify the function further.\n\nInstead, we can use L'HÃ´pital's Rule, which states that if the limit of the ratio of the derivatives of two functions exists and is finite, then the limit of the original functions is equal to the limit of the ratio of their derivatives.\n\nSo, let's find the derivatives of the numerator and denominator:\n\nd/dx (2x + 8) = 2\nd/dx (x - 4) = 1\n\nNow, we can find the limit of the ratio of the derivatives as x approaches 4:\n\nlim (x->4) (2/1) = 2\n\nSince the limit of the ratio of the derivatives exists and is finite, the limit of the original function ((2x+8)/(x-4)) as x approaches 4 is also 2."
