    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 2x + 1, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x), which will give us the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nStep 1: Find the first derivative, f'(x).\nUsing the power rule, we have:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4) - d/dx(8x^3) + d/dx(2x) + d/dx(1)\nf'(x) = 4(3x^3) - 3(8x^2) + 2\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 24x^2 + 2\n\nStep 2: Find the second derivative, f''(x).\nNow, we'll find the derivative of f'(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3) - d/dx(24x^2) + d/dx(2)\nf''(x) = 3(12x^2) - 2(24x)\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 + 2x + 1 is f''(x) = 36x^2 - 48x."
