    "message_2": "To solve the equation 2cos(2x) - √3 = 0 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π, we first isolate the cosine function:\n\n2cos(2x) = √3\ncos(2x) = √3/2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of 2x for which the cosine function equals √3/2. We know that cos(π/6) = √3/2 and cos(11π/6) = √3/2. Since the cosine function has a period of 2π, we can find all the solutions for 2x in the range 0 ≤ 2x ≤ 4π:\n\n2x = π/6 + 2πn and 2x = 11π/6 + 2πn, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π:\n\nx = (π/6 + 2πn)/2 and x = (11π/6 + 2πn)/2\n\nFor n = 0:\nx = π/6 and x = 11π/6\n\nFor n = 1:\nx = (π/6 + 2π)/2 = 5π/6 and x = (11π/6 + 2π)/2 = 17π/6\n\nHowever, 17π/6 > 2π, so we discard this solution.\n\nThus, the solutions for x in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π are:\n\nx = π/6, 5π/6, and 11π/6."
