    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation, we first need to find the characteristic equation. Let's assume that the solution is of the form $E(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the given differential equation, we get:\n\n$X''(x)T(t) = \\mu_0\\epsilon_0 X(x)T''(t)$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = \\mu_0\\epsilon_0 \\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $x$ and the right side depends only on $t$, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-k^2$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -k^2 = \\mu_0\\epsilon_0 \\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)}$\n\nNow we have two separate ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $X''(x) + k^2X(x) = 0$\n\n2) $T''(t) + \\frac{k^2}{\\mu_0\\epsilon_0}T(t) = 0$\n\nThe general solution for equation (1) is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$\n\nThe general solution for equation (2) is:\n\n$T(t) = C\\cos(\\omega t) + D\\sin(\\omega t)$, where $\\omega = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\epsilon_0}}$\n\nNow, let's use the initial conditions to find the constants $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n\n$E(x, 0) = 5\\times10^3 \\sin(2\\pi \\times 10^9 t)$\n\n$X(x)T(0) = (A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx))(C\\cos(0) + D\\sin(0))$\n\nSince $T(0) = C$, we have:\n\n$E(x, 0) = 5\\times10^3 \\sin(2\\pi \\times 10^9 t) = X(x)C$\n\nNow, we need to find the initial rate of change of electric field intensity:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t}(x, 0) = 0$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(X(x)T(t))|_{t=0} = 0$\n\n$X(x)T'(0) = 0$\n\nSince $X(x)$ is not zero, we must have $T'(0) = 0$. This means that $D = 0$.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$E(x, 0) = X(x)C = 5\\times10^3 \\sin(2\\pi \\times 10^9 t)$\n\nComparing this with the general solution, we can see that $A = 0$, $B = 1$, and $C = 5\\times10^3$. Therefore, the expression for electric field intensity $E(x, t)$ at any point $x$ in free space and time $t$ is:\n\n$E(x, t) = 5\\times10^3 \\sin(kx)\\cos(\\omega t)$, where $\\omega = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\epsilon_0}}$"
