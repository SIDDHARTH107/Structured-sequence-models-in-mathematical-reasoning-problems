    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 12 cm. What is the surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each face and then add them together. A rectangular prism has six faces: two pairs of opposite faces with the same dimensions.\n\n1. The two faces with dimensions length × width (8 cm × 5 cm): 2 × (8 × 5) = 2 × 40 = 80 square cm\n2. The two faces with dimensions length × height (8 cm × 12 cm): 2 × (8 × 12) = 2 × 96 = 192 square cm\n3. The two faces with dimensions width × height (5 cm × 12 cm): 2 × (5 × 12) = 2 × 60 = 120 square cm\n\nNow, add the areas of all the faces together:\n\n80 + 192 + 120 = 392 square cm\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 392 square cm."
