    "message_2": "A △ B represents the symmetric difference between sets A and B, which includes elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. To find A △ B, we can list the elements that are unique to each set:\n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find B △ A. This is the symmetric difference between sets B and A, which is the same as A △ B since the order of the sets does not matter in symmetric difference:\n\nB △ A = A △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of A △ B and B △ A, which is represented by A △ B ∩ B △ A. The intersection of two sets includes elements that are common to both sets. Since A △ B and B △ A are the same sets, their intersection will be the same as the sets themselves:\n\nA △ B ∩ B △ A = {1, 4}"
