    "message_2": "1) To triangulate the square, we can draw one diagonal, which divides the square into two triangles.\n\n2) Now, we subdivide each of the two triangles into four smaller triangles by connecting the midpoints of their sides. For each triangle, this results in 4 smaller triangles, so for the two triangles, we have a total of 2 * 4 = 8 smaller triangles.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 triangles in the resulting subdivision."
