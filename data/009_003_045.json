Suppose that the temperature at $x=0$ is fixed at $u(0,t)=30$ for all $t$, and that the temperature at $x=L$ is fixed at $u(L,t)=50$ for all $t$. The initial temperature distribution is $u(x,0)=40\\sin(\\pi x/L)$. Find the temperature distribution $u(x,t)$ at a time $t=T$, where $T=0.01$ seconds and $L=1$ meter.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T'(t) = kX''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $kX(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{kT(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the separation constant. We now have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $T'(t) + k\\lambda T(t) = 0$\n2) $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\nWe will first solve the spatial equation (2). Since the boundary conditions are homogeneous, we expect a non-trivial solution for $\\lambda > 0$. Thus, we assume $\\lambda = (\\frac{n\\pi}{L})^2$ for some integer $n$. The general solution for the spatial equation is:\n\n$X(x) = A_n\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}) + B_n\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L})$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = 30$ and $u(L,t) = 50$, we get:\n\n$A_n = 0$ and $B_n\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$\n\nSince $B_n\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$ for all integers $n$, we have a non-trivial solution for $B_n$ when $n$ is an odd integer. Thus, the spatial part of the solution is:\n\n$X_n(x) = B_n\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L})$\n\nNow, we solve the temporal equation (1):\n\n$T'(t) + k(\\frac{n\\pi}{L})^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its general solution is:\n\n$T_n(t) = C_n e^{-k(\\frac{n\\pi}{L})^2 t}$\n\nThe overall solution is a linear combination of the product of the spatial and temporal parts:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...} B_n\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}) C_n e^{-k(\\frac{n\\pi}{L})^2 t}$\n\nTo find the coefficients $B_n$ and $C_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = 40\\sin(\\pi x/L)$. At $t=0$, we have:\n\n$40\\sin(\\pi x/L) = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...} B_n\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}) C_n$\n\nSince the initial condition only has the first term of the sine series, we can conclude that $B_1 = 40$ and $C_1 = 1$. All other coefficients are zero. Thus, the solution is:\n\n$u(x,t) = 40\\sin(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}) e^{-k(\\frac{\\pi}{L})^2 t}$\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature distribution at $t=T=0.01$ seconds and $L=1$ meter:\n\n$u(x,0.01) = 40\\sin(\\pi x) e^{-k\\pi^2 (0.01)}$\n\nTo fully determine the solution, we would need the value of the thermal diffusivity $k$. However, the above expression gives the temperature distribution $u(x,t)$ at time $t=0.01$ seconds for any given $k$."
