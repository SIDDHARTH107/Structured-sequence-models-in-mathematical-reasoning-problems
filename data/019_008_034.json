    "message_1": "A factory produces fuzzy balls with a weight of 200 grams each. However, due to manufacturing variations, the weight of the balls can vary by up to 10%. What is the minimum and maximum possible weight of a fuzzy ball produced by the factory?",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum and maximum possible weight of a fuzzy ball, we need to calculate 10% of the standard weight (200 grams) and then subtract and add that value to the standard weight.\n\n10% of 200 grams = (10/100) * 200 = 20 grams\n\nMinimum possible weight = 200 grams - 20 grams = 180 grams\nMaximum possible weight = 200 grams + 20 grams = 220 grams\n\nSo, the minimum possible weight of a fuzzy ball is 180 grams, and the maximum possible weight is 220 grams."
