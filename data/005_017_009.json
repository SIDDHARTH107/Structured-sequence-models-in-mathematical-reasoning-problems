    "message_2": "To find the first two principal components of the dataset, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the dataset.\n2. Subtract the mean from each data point.\n3. Calculate the covariance matrix.\n4. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\n5. Select the eigenvectors corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues as the first two principal components.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of the dataset:\n\nMean = (85 + 92 + 78 + 89 + 90 + 86 + 94 + 91 + 80 + 83 + 87 + 88 + 95 + 84 + 82 + 93 + 79 + 81 + 96 + 77) / 20\nMean = 1765 / 20\nMean = 88.25\n\n2. Subtract the mean from each data point:\n\nCentered data = [-3.25, 3.75, -10.25, 0.75, 1.75, -2.25, 5.75, 2.75, -8.25, -5.25, -1.25, -0.25, 6.75, -4.25, -6.25, 4.75, -9.25, -7.25, 7.75, -11.25]\n\n3. Calculate the covariance matrix:\n\nSince we have only one variable (the data points), the covariance matrix will be a 1x1 matrix, which is just the variance of the centered data.\n\nVariance = sum(centered_data^2) / (n - 1)\nVariance = sum([-3.25^2, 3.75^2, -10.25^2, 0.75^2, 1.75^2, -2.25^2, 5.75^2, 2.75^2, -8.25^2, -5.25^2, -1.25^2, -0.25^2, 6.75^2, -4.25^2, -6.25^2, 4.75^2, -9.25^2, -7.25^2, 7.75^2, -11.25^2]) / 19\nVariance = (10.5625 + 14.0625 + 105.0625 + 0.5625 + 3.0625 + 5.0625 + 33.0625 + 7.5625 + 68.0625 + 27.5625 + 1.5625 + 0.0625 + 45.5625 + 18.0625 + 39.0625 + 22.5625 + 85.5625 + 52.5625 + 60.0625 + 126.5625) / 19\nVariance = 695.25 / 19\nVariance â‰ˆ 36.5921\n\nCovariance matrix = [36.5921]\n\n4. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix:\n\nSince the covariance matrix is a 1x1 matrix, the eigenvalue is just the value itself (36.5921), and the eigenvector is [1].\n\nEigenvalue: 36.5921\nEigenvector: [1]\n\n5. Select the eigenvectors corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues as the first two principal components:\n\nIn this case, we have only one eigenvector, which corresponds to the largest eigenvalue. Therefore, the first principal component is [1]. Since we have only one variable, there is no second principal component.\n\nFirst principal component: [1]\nSecond principal component: None (only one variable in the dataset)"
