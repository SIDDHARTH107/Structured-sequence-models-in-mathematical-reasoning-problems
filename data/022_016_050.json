    "message_2": "To find the image of the circle centered at $0$ with radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ under the mapping $f(z)$, we first need to find the Riemann mapping $f(z)$. We know that $f(0) = 1+i$, and we want to map the unit disk $D$ conformally to the region $G$. \n\nA standard conformal mapping from the unit disk to the right half-plane is given by the function:\n\n$$g(z) = \\frac{1+z}{1-z}$$\n\nHowever, we need to adjust this mapping to satisfy the condition $f(0) = 1+i$. To do this, we can compose $g(z)$ with a rotation and a dilation. Let $h(z) = a g(z) + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are complex constants. We want to find $a$ and $b$ such that $h(0) = 1+i$.\n\nPlugging in $z=0$ into the expression for $h(z)$, we get:\n\n$$h(0) = a g(0) + b = a + b$$\n\nSince we want $h(0) = 1+i$, we have $a + b = 1+i$. Now, we need to find $a$ and $b$ such that the image of the unit circle under $h(z)$ is the boundary of the region $G$. The boundary of $G$ is the imaginary axis, which is a straight line. \n\nWe know that the image of the unit circle under $g(z)$ is the real axis. To map the real axis to the imaginary axis, we can simply multiply by $i$. Thus, we can choose $a=i$ and $b=1$. This gives us the desired Riemann mapping:\n\n$$f(z) = i g(z) + 1 = i \\frac{1+z}{1-z} + 1$$\n\nNow we want to find the image of the circle centered at $0$ with radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ under this mapping. The circle can be parametrized by $z(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{i\\theta}$, where $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. Plugging this into the expression for $f(z)$, we get:\n\n$$f(z(\\theta)) = i \\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}e^{i\\theta}}{1-\\frac{1}{2}e^{i\\theta}} + 1$$\n\nTo find the image of the circle, we can simplify this expression:\n\n$$f(z(\\theta)) = i \\frac{2+e^{i\\theta}}{2-e^{i\\theta}} + 1 = i \\frac{(2+e^{i\\theta})(2+e^{-i\\theta})}{(2-e^{i\\theta})(2+e^{-i\\theta})} + 1$$\n\nUsing the identity $e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta} = 2\\cos\\theta$, we can simplify the expression further:\n\n$$f(z(\\theta)) = i \\frac{(2+e^{i\\theta})(2+e^{-i\\theta})}{(2-e^{i\\theta})(2+e^{-i\\theta})} + 1 = i \\frac{4+4\\cos\\theta+1}{4-4\\cos\\theta+1} + 1$$\n\n$$f(z(\\theta)) = i \\frac{5+4\\cos\\theta}{5-4\\cos\\theta} + 1$$\n\nThis is the parametric equation for the image of the circle centered at $0$ with radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ under the mapping $f(z)$. The image is an ellipse with center at $1+i$ and semi-major and semi-minor axes given by the coefficients of the $\\cos\\theta$ term in the numerator and denominator, respectively."
