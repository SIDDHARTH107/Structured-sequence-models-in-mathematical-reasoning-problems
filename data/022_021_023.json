    "message_2": "The Laplace transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫(e^(-st) * f(t)) dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nWe want to find the Laplace transform of f(t) = 2t^2 + 5t + 9. We'll do this by finding the Laplace transform of each term separately and then adding them together.\n\n1. For the first term, 2t^2:\n\nL{2t^2} = ∫(e^(-st) * 2t^2) dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice. Let u = t^2 and dv = e^(-st) * 2t dt. Then, du = 2t dt and v = -e^(-st)/s. Now, we can use integration by parts again with u = t and dv = -e^(-st)/s dt. Then, du = dt and v = e^(-st)/s^2.\n\nUsing integration by parts twice, we get:\n\nL{2t^2} = (-e^(-st) * t^2 / s) - ∫(-e^(-st) * 2t / s) dt, from 0 to infinity\n= (2/s) * ∫(e^(-st) * t) dt, from 0 to infinity\n= (2/s) * (e^(-st) * t / s^2 - ∫(e^(-st) / s^2) dt), from 0 to infinity\n= (2/s) * (e^(-st) * t / s^2 - e^(-st) / s^3), from 0 to infinity\n\nNow, we evaluate the limits:\n\nL{2t^2} = (2/s) * (0 - 0) - (2/s) * (0 - 1/s^3)\n= 2/s^4\n\n2. For the second term, 5t:\n\nL{5t} = ∫(e^(-st) * 5t) dt, from 0 to infinity\n\nUsing integration by parts with u = t and dv = 5e^(-st) dt, we get du = dt and v = -5e^(-st)/s. Thus,\n\nL{5t} = (-5e^(-st) * t / s) - ∫(-5e^(-st) / s) dt, from 0 to infinity\n= (5/s) * (e^(-st) * t - ∫(e^(-st)) dt), from 0 to infinity\n= (5/s) * (e^(-st) * t + e^(-st) / s), from 0 to infinity\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nL{5t} = (5/s) * (0 - 0) - (5/s) * (0 - 1/s)\n= 5/s^2\n\n3. For the third term, 9:\n\nL{9} = ∫(e^(-st) * 9) dt, from 0 to infinity\n= 9 * ∫(e^(-st)) dt, from 0 to infinity\n= 9 * (-e^(-st) / s), from 0 to infinity\n\nEvaluating the limits:\n\nL{9} = 9 * (0 - (-1/s))\n= 9/s\n\nNow, we add the Laplace transforms of each term together:\n\nL{2t^2 + 5t + 9} = L{2t^2} + L{5t} + L{9}\n= 2/s^4 + 5/s^2 + 9/s\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of f(t) = 2t^2 + 5t + 9 is F(s) = 2/s^4 + 5/s^2 + 9/s."
