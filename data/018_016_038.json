    "message_1": "Let A = {1,2,3} and B = {4,5}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B and the Cartesian product of B and A. Next, find the union of these two Cartesian products. Show that the union of the Cartesian products is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted as A × B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of B and A, denoted as B × A. This is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b ∈ B and a ∈ A.\n\nB × A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNext, we will find the union of these two Cartesian products, denoted as (A × B) ∪ (B × A). This is the set of all elements that are in either A × B or B × A or both.\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's check if the union of the Cartesian products is commutative. Commutativity means that the order of the sets in the union operation does not matter, i.e., (A × B) ∪ (B × A) = (B × A) ∪ (A × B). In this case, we can see that the union of the Cartesian products is indeed commutative:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\n(B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nAs we can see, both sets are equal, so the union of the Cartesian products is commutative."
