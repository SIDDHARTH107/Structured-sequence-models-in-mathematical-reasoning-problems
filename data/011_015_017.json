    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using Ramsey Theory. In this case, we are looking for the minimum number of vertices in a complete graph such that every edge is either colored red (representing friendship) or blue (representing non-friendship), and there is either a red triangle (three people who know each other) or a blue triangle (three people who do not know each other).\n\nThe Ramsey number R(3,3) represents the minimum number of vertices required to guarantee either a red triangle or a blue triangle. It is known that R(3,3) = 6. Since there are 6 people at the party, we are guaranteed to have either a red triangle or a blue triangle.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible friendship alliances:\n\n1. If there is a red triangle (three people who know each other), then the other three people can either know each other (forming another red triangle) or not know each other (forming a blue triangle). In this case, there are 2 possible friendship alliances.\n\n2. If there is a blue triangle (three people who do not know each other), then the other three people must form a red triangle (otherwise, we would have a blue triangle and a blue hexagon, which is not allowed). In this case, there is 1 possible friendship alliance.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 2 + 1 = 3 possible ways of friendship alliances at the party."
