    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve process to each side of an equilateral triangle. In each iteration, every straight line segment is replaced by a Koch curve segment with 4 parts, each 1/3 the length of the original segment.\n\nLet's denote the total length of the Koch island at the nth iteration as L_n. The initial triangle has 3 sides, each with a length of 1 unit. So, L_0 = 3.\n\nAt the first iteration (n=1), each side of the triangle is replaced by a Koch curve segment with 4 parts, each 1/3 the length of the original segment. So, the total length of the Koch island at the first iteration is L_1 = 3 * 4 * (1/3) = 4.\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the total length of the Koch island is 4/3 times the length of the previous iteration. Therefore, we can express the total length at the nth iteration as:\n\nL_n = L_(n-1) * (4/3)\n\nNow, we want to find the total length of the Koch island at the 5th iteration (n=5). We can use the formula above to calculate the total length at each iteration:\n\nL_1 = 4 (already calculated)\nL_2 = L_1 * (4/3) = 4 * (4/3) = 16/3\nL_3 = L_2 * (4/3) = (16/3) * (4/3) = 64/9\nL_4 = L_3 * (4/3) = (64/9) * (4/3) = 256/27\nL_5 = L_4 * (4/3) = (256/27) * (4/3) = 1024/81\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch island at the 5th iteration is 1024/81 units."
