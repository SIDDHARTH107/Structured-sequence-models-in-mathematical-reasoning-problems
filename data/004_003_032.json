    "message_1": "A farmer has 400 meters of fencing and wants to enclose a rectangular plot of land. What is the maximum area she can enclose?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter, the farmer should create a rectangle with the length and width as close as possible to each other. In other words, the farmer should create a square.\n\nSince the farmer has 400 meters of fencing, we can set up the following equation for the perimeter of the square:\n\nPerimeter = 4 * side_length\n400 = 4 * side_length\n\nNow, we can solve for the side_length:\n\nside_length = 400 / 4\nside_length = 100 meters\n\nSo, the farmer should create a square with side lengths of 100 meters. To find the maximum area, we can use the formula for the area of a square:\n\nArea = side_length^2\nArea = 100^2\nArea = 10,000 square meters\n\nThe maximum area the farmer can enclose with 400 meters of fencing is 10,000 square meters."
