    "message_1": "Suppose a system exhibits chaotic behavior with a Lyapunov exponent of 0.5. If the initial condition is known to within an uncertainty of 0.001, what is the maximum prediction time for which the uncertainty will remain within 10% of the initial uncertainty?",
    "message_2": "The Lyapunov exponent (λ) is a measure of the rate at which nearby trajectories in a dynamical system diverge from each other. In this case, the Lyapunov exponent is given as 0.5. The initial uncertainty (Δx₀) is 0.001, and we want to find the maximum prediction time (t) for which the uncertainty remains within 10% of the initial uncertainty.\n\nThe formula relating the Lyapunov exponent, initial uncertainty, and uncertainty at time t (Δx(t)) is:\n\nΔx(t) = Δx₀ * e^(λt)\n\nWe want the uncertainty at time t to be within 10% of the initial uncertainty, so:\n\nΔx(t) ≤ 1.1 * Δx₀\n\nSubstituting the formula for Δx(t) and the given values:\n\nΔx₀ * e^(λt) ≤ 1.1 * Δx₀\n\nDivide both sides by Δx₀:\n\ne^(λt) ≤ 1.1\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nλt ≤ ln(1.1)\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt ≤ ln(1.1) / λ\n\nSubstitute the given value for λ:\n\nt ≤ ln(1.1) / 0.5\n\nCalculate the value:\n\nt ≤ 0.0953 / 0.5\nt ≤ 0.1906\n\nSo, the maximum prediction time for which the uncertainty will remain within 10% of the initial uncertainty is approximately 0.1906 time units."
