    "message_1": "A group of 20 students took a math test. The teacher assigned 10 students to a control group and 10 students to an experimental group. The control group received no additional instruction, while the experimental group received a one-hour tutorial before taking the test. The mean score for the control group was 75 and the standard deviation was 5. The mean score for the experimental group was 82 and the standard deviation was 4. Determine whether there is a significant difference in scores between the control and experimental groups using a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine whether there is a significant difference in scores between the control and experimental groups, we will perform a two-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference between the two groups, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant difference.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the pooled standard deviation (Sp):\n\nSp = sqrt[((n1 - 1) * s1^2 + (n2 - 1) * s2^2) / (n1 + n2 - 2)]\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of the control and experimental groups, and s1 and s2 are their standard deviations.\n\nSp = sqrt[((10 - 1) * 5^2 + (10 - 1) * 4^2) / (10 + 10 - 2)]\nSp = sqrt[(9 * 25 + 9 * 16) / 18]\nSp = sqrt[(225 + 144) / 18]\nSp = sqrt[369 / 18]\nSp = sqrt[20.5]\nSp ≈ 4.53\n\nNext, we calculate the t-score:\n\nt = (M1 - M2) / (Sp * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2))\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the mean scores of the control and experimental groups.\n\nt = (75 - 82) / (4.53 * sqrt(1/10 + 1/10))\nt = (-7) / (4.53 * sqrt(1/5))\nt = (-7) / (4.53 * sqrt(0.2))\nt ≈ -3.49\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 18 degrees of freedom (n1 + n2 - 2).\n\nUsing a t-distribution table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately ±2.101.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-3.49) is less than the critical t-value (-2.101), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that there is a significant difference in scores between the control and experimental groups at a significance level of 0.05."
