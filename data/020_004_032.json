    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces two types of products: chairs and tables. Each chair requires 3 meters of fabric and 2 hours of labor, and each table requires 4 meters of fabric and 3 hours of labor. The manufacturer has 60 meters of fabric and 36 hours of labor available in a week to produce chairs and tables. The profit of each chair is $30 and each table is $50. How many chairs and tables should the manufacturer produce in a week to maximize the profit?",
