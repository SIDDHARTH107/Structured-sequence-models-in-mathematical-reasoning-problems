    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to create a numerical problem for Deontic logic as it deals with normative statements rather than quantitative values or equations. Deontic logic is concerned with the logic of obligation, permission, and prohibition. A question related to Deontic logic would be framed around determining what actions are permitted, prohibited, or obligatory in a certain scenario. For example, \"In a company setting, if it is obligatory for employees to submit weekly reports, and John fails to do so, what deontic statement can be applied to John's action?\"",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, we can analyze John's action using deontic logic. Since it is obligatory for employees to submit weekly reports and John fails to do so, his action can be considered as a violation of the obligation. Therefore, the deontic statement that can be applied to John's action is that it is prohibited."
