    "message_2": "To determine the minimum number of colors required to properly color the vertices of a simple graph with 7 vertices, we need to consider the graph's maximum degree (Δ), which is the highest number of edges connected to a single vertex.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, we have a complete graph where each vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this case, the maximum degree (Δ) is 6, as each vertex is connected to the other 6 vertices.\n\nAccording to the graph coloring theorem, the minimum number of colors required to properly color a graph is Δ + 1 if the graph is not bipartite. However, if the graph is bipartite, the minimum number of colors required is 2.\n\nIn this case, since the graph is not bipartite (a complete graph with an odd number of vertices is never bipartite), the minimum number of colors required to properly color the vertices is Δ + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7."
