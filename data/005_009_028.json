    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the differences between the observed ages and the hypothesized median (25).\n2. Rank the absolute differences, ignoring the signs.\n3. Sum the ranks of the positive differences and the ranks of the negative differences.\n4. Calculate the test statistic (W) as the smaller of the two sums.\n5. Compare the test statistic (W) to the critical value for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test at the desired significance level (usually 0.05).\n\nLet's perform the test:\n\n1. Calculate the differences:\n\n-6, 1, 6, 13, -6, -4, 23, 4, -4, 7, 1, 1, -1, 6, -7, -6, 5, -3, 1, 3, -6, 0, 1, 6, 10, 11, 4, -3, -6, -1, 5, -6, -3, -4, 12, 0, -1, 2, 20, -2, -1, 1, -1, -2, 4, 2, -3, -2, 14\n\n2. Rank the absolute differences (ignoring signs):\n\n1, 1.5, 6.5, 19, 1, 3, 25, 4.5, 3, 8, 1.5, 1.5, 1, 6.5, 2, 1, 5, 2.5, 1.5, 4, 1, 0, 1.5, 6.5, 15, 16, 4.5, 2.5, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2.5, 3, 18, 0, 1, 3.5, 24, 3.5, 1, 1.5, 1, 3.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5, 20\n\n3. Sum the ranks of the positive differences and the ranks of the negative differences:\n\nPositive differences: 1.5 + 6.5 + 19 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 6.5 + 5 + 1.5 + 6.5 + 15 + 16 + 4.5 + 1.5 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1.5 + 1 + 3.5 + 24 + 3.5 + 1.5 + 1 + 3.5 + 4.5 + 3.5 + 3.5 + 20 = 166.5\n\nNegative differences: 1 + 1 + 3 + 4.5 + 3 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 2.5 + 1.5 + 4 + 1 + 2.5 + 3 + 18 + 2.5 + 3.5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3.5 + 4.5 + 3.5 + 2.5 + 3.5 = 98.5\n\n4. Calculate the test statistic (W) as the smaller of the two sums:\n\nW = min(166.5, 98.5) = 98.5\n\n5. Compare the test statistic (W) to the critical value for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test at the desired significance level (usually 0.05).\n\nFor a sample size of 50 and a significance level of 0.05, the critical value for a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test is 67. Since our test statistic (W = 98.5) is greater than the critical value (67), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion: There is not enough evidence to conclude that the median age is different from 25."
