    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices in the graph such that each vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the matching. In other words, every vertex is paired with another vertex, and no two pairs share a vertex.\n\nIn this graph, we can see that it has an odd number of vertices (5). For a graph to have a perfect matching, it must have an even number of vertices. Therefore, there can be no perfect matchings in this graph. The maximum number of perfect matchings that can be identified in this graph is 0."
