    "message_2": "To simplify the given trigonometric expression, we need to rewrite the terms in terms of sin(x) and cos(x). Recall that:\n\ntan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x)\nsec(x) = 1 / cos(x)\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the given expression:\n\ntan(x)sec(x) - sin(x)cos(x) = (sin(x) / cos(x)) * (1 / cos(x)) - sin(x)cos(x)\n\nNow, simplify the expression:\n\n(sin(x) / cos^2(x)) - sin(x)cos(x)\n\nTo express the entire expression in terms of sin(x) and cos(x), we can find a common denominator for the two terms:\n\n(sin(x) - sin(x)cos^3(x)) / cos^2(x)\n\nThis is the simplified expression in terms of sin(x) and cos(x):\n\n(sin(x) - sin(x)cos^3(x)) / cos^2(x)"
