    "message_2": "Yes, we can construct an intuitionistic proof to show that the sum of an odd number x and an even number y is odd.\n\nLet x be an odd number and y be an even number. By definition, we can represent x and y as follows:\n\nx = 2m + 1 (where m is an integer)\ny = 2n (where n is an integer)\n\nNow, we want to show that the sum x + y is odd. Let's compute the sum:\n\nx + y = (2m + 1) + (2n)\n\nUsing the distributive property, we can rewrite the sum as:\n\nx + y = 2m + 2n + 1\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the first two terms:\n\nx + y = 2(m + n) + 1\n\nSince m and n are integers, their sum (m + n) is also an integer. Let's denote this sum as p, where p = m + n. Thus, we can rewrite the sum as:\n\nx + y = 2p + 1\n\nThis is the definition of an odd number, where p is an integer. Therefore, we have shown that the sum of an odd number x and an even number y is odd."
