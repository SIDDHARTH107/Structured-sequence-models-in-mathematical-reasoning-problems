    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem a student can solve: \n\nThe equation of a curve is y = x^2 + 3x + 2. Find the slope of the tangent line of the curve at point x = 2.",
    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line at a given point on the curve, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to x, which represents the slope of the curve at any point x.\n\nThe given function is y = x^2 + 3x + 2.\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we have:\n\ndy/dx = d(x^2)/dx + d(3x)/dx + d(2)/dx\n\ndy/dx = 2x + 3 + 0\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at x = 2. Substitute x = 2 into the derivative:\n\ndy/dx = 2(2) + 3\n\ndy/dx = 4 + 3\n\ndy/dx = 7\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at the point x = 2 is 7."
