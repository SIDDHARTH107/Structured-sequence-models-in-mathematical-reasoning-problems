    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nA ∩ B = {4, 6}\n\nSo, A ∆ B = {2, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and (A ∩ B):\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ (A ∩ B) = ({2, 8} ∪ {4, 6}) - ({2, 8} ∩ {4, 6})\n\n{2, 8} ∪ {4, 6} = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n{2, 8} ∩ {4, 6} = {}\n\nSo, (A ∆ B) ∆ (A ∩ B) = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection. We need to show that:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C)\n\nLet's use the given sets A and B, and let C = {2, 4, 6, 8}. Then:\n\nA ∆ B = {2, 8}\nA ∩ C = {2, 4, 6}\nB ∩ C = {4, 6, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∩ C) and (B ∩ C):\n\n(A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C) = ({2, 4, 6} ∪ {4, 6, 8}) - ({2, 4, 6} ∩ {4, 6, 8})\n\n{2, 4, 6} ∪ {4, 6, 8} = {2, 4, 6, 8}\n{2, 4, 6} ∩ {4, 6, 8} = {4, 6}\n\nSo, (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C) = {2, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of (A ∆ B) and C:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = {2, 8} ∩ {2, 4, 6, 8} = {2, 8}\n\nSince (A ∆ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C), the symmetric difference is distributive over intersection."
