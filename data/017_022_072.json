    "message_1": "Consider a group G of order 60. Let H be a subgroup of G such that the order of H is 6. Determine the number of distinct subgroups of G that are isomorphic to H.",
    "message_2": "Since the order of G is 60, we can write it as a product of its prime factors: 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. Now, let's consider the order of H, which is 6. We can write it as a product of its prime factors: 6 = 2 * 3.\n\nBy Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order 2^2 = 4) in G divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1, 3, 5, or 15. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (subgroups of order 3) in G divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups are 1, 4, 10, or 20.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroups of G that are isomorphic to H. Since H has order 6, it must contain a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 4 and a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3. Let's denote the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G as n_2 and the number of Sylow 3-subgroups as n_3.\n\nBy the counting formula for the number of distinct subgroups isomorphic to H, we have:\n\n|H| = (n_2 * (n_2 - 1) * n_3 * (n_3 - 1)) / 2.\n\nWe can now try different combinations of n_2 and n_3 to find the number of distinct subgroups isomorphic to H:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then |H| = 0, which is not possible since H exists.\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then |H| = 0, which is not possible.\n3. If n_2 = 5 and n_3 = 1, then |H| = 0, which is not possible.\n4. If n_2 = 15 and n_3 = 1, then |H| = 0, which is not possible.\n5. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then |H| = 0, which is not possible.\n6. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then |H| = 6, which is a possible solution.\n7. If n_2 = 5 and n_3 = 4, then |H| = 60, which is not possible since there cannot be more subgroups isomorphic to H than the order of G.\n8. If n_2 = 15 and n_3 = 4, then |H| = 840, which is not possible.\n9. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 10, then |H| = 0, which is not possible.\n10. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 10, then |H| = 60, which is not possible.\n11. If n_2 = 5 and n_3 = 10, then |H| = 200, which is not possible.\n12. If n_2 = 15 and n_3 = 10, then |H| = 2100, which is not possible.\n13. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 20, then |H| = 0, which is not possible.\n14. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 20, then |H| = 1140, which is not possible.\n15. If n_2 = 5 and n_3 = 20, then |H| = 3800, which is not possible.\n16. If n_2 = 15 and n_3 = 20, then |H| = 39900, which is not possible.\n\nThe only possible solution is when n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, which gives us |H| = 6. Therefore, there are 6 distinct subgroups of G that are isomorphic to H."
