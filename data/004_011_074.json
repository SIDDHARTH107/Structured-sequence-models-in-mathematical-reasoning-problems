Find the rate at which the water level is rising when the water is 6 feet deep. (Hint: Use related rates equations for the volume and surface area of a cone)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the related rates equation for the volume of a cone. The volume V of a cone with radius r and height h is given by the formula:\n\nV = (1/3)πr^2h\n\nWe are given that the tank is being filled at a rate of 5 cubic feet per minute, so dV/dt = 5 ft³/min. We want to find the rate at which the water level is rising, which is dh/dt, when the water is 6 feet deep (h = 6).\n\nSince the tank has a fixed shape, the ratio of the radius to the height is constant:\n\nr/h = 5/10 = 1/2\n\nSo, r = (1/2)h.\n\nNow, we will differentiate the volume equation with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = d/dt[(1/3)πr^2h]\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\n5 = (1/3)π(2r(dr/dt)h + r^2(dh/dt))\n\nNow, we will substitute r = (1/2)h:\n\n5 = (1/3)π((1/2)h)^2(dh/dt) + (1/2)h(2(1/2)h(dh/dt))\n\nWhen the water is 6 feet deep (h = 6), we can find the corresponding radius:\n\nr = (1/2)(6) = 3\n\nNow, we will substitute h = 6 and r = 3 into the equation:\n\n5 = (1/3)π(3^2(dh/dt) + 3(6)(dh/dt))\n\n5 = (1/3)π(9(dh/dt) + 18(dh/dt))\n\nNow, we will solve for dh/dt:\n\n5 = (1/3)π(27(dh/dt))\n\n15 = π(27(dh/dt))\n\n15/(27π) = dh/dt\n\ndh/dt = 5/(9π)\n\nSo, the rate at which the water level is rising when the water is 6 feet deep is 5/(9π) feet per minute."
