    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 2x for -π < x < π, we need to calculate the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is odd, we know that a_n = 0 for all n. We only need to calculate the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe general formula for b_n is:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L)) dx, where the integral is taken over one period of the function.\n\nIn this case, L = π, so the formula becomes:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * ∫(2x * sin(n * x)) dx, where the integral is taken from -π to π.\n\nNow, we integrate by parts:\n\nLet u = 2x, dv = sin(n * x) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = -(1/n) * cos(n * x)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * [-(2x/n) * cos(n * x) + (2/n) * ∫cos(n * x) dx] evaluated from -π to π\n\nNow, we integrate the remaining term:\n\n(2/n) * ∫cos(n * x) dx = (2/n) * (1/n) * sin(n * x)\n\nSo, b_n = (2/π) * [-(2x/n) * cos(n * x) + (2/n^2) * sin(n * x)] evaluated from -π to π\n\nb_n = (2/π) * {[-(2π/n) * cos(n * π) + (2/n^2) * sin(n * π)] - [-(2(-π)/n) * cos(-n * π) + (2/n^2) * sin(-n * π)]}\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n and sin(n * π) = 0, we get:\n\nb_n = (2/π) * {[-(2π/n) * (-1)^n + 0] - [-(2(-π)/n) * (-1)^(-n) + 0]}\n\nb_n = (2/π) * {(-1)^n * 2π/n + (-1)^(-n) * 2π/n}\n\nb_n = (4/π) * {(-1)^n * π/n}\n\nSo, the Fourier series of the function f(x) = 2x for -π < x < π is:\n\nf(x) = ∑[(4/π) * ((-1)^n * π/n) * sin(n * x)], where the sum is taken over all odd n."
