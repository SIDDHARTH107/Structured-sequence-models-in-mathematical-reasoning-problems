    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve, and its length increases with each order. The length of the Hilbert curve at each order can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nLength = n * (2^(order) - 1)\n\nwhere n is the length of one side of the square in which the curve is drawn, and order is the order of the Hilbert curve.\n\nFor a 5th order Hilbert curve, we have:\n\nLength = n * (2^5 - 1)\nLength = n * (32 - 1)\nLength = n * 31\n\nThe total length of the 5th order Hilbert curve is 31 times the length of one side of the square (n). Without knowing the length of one side of the square, we can only express the total length as 31n."
