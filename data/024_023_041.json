    "message_2": "The given equation represents a 3-dimensional sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin (0, 0, 0) in the Euclidean space R^3. The symmetries of M are the transformations that preserve the geometric structure of the sphere. In this case, the symmetries are the rotations and reflections that map the sphere onto itself.\n\n1. Rotations: The sphere is invariant under rotations about any axis passing through the origin. These rotations can be represented by 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1, which form the special orthogonal group SO(3).\n\n2. Reflections: The sphere is also invariant under reflections about any plane passing through the origin. These reflections can be represented by 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant -1.\n\nThe combination of rotations and reflections forms the orthogonal group O(3), which is the group of all 3x3 orthogonal matrices. Therefore, the symmetries of M are described by the orthogonal group O(3)."
