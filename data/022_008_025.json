    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of the entire function f(z) = e^z - 3z^3 within the disc |z|<=2, we can use the argument principle. The argument principle states that if f(z) is a meromorphic function (a function that is holomorphic except for isolated singularities) inside and on some closed contour C, and f has no zeros or poles on C, then\n\nN - P = (1/2πi) ∮(f'(z)/f(z)) dz\n\nwhere N is the number of zeros, P is the number of poles, and the integral is taken over the contour C.\n\nIn our case, f(z) = e^z - 3z^3 is an entire function, so it has no poles. We want to find the number of zeros within the disc |z|<=2, so we can take the contour C to be the circle |z|=2.\n\nFirst, let's compute the derivative of f(z):\n\nf'(z) = d/dz (e^z - 3z^3) = e^z - 9z^2\n\nNow, we need to compute the integral of f'(z)/f(z) over the contour C:\n\n(1/2πi) ∮(f'(z)/f(z)) dz = (1/2πi) ∮((e^z - 9z^2)/(e^z - 3z^3)) dz\n\nWe can parameterize the contour C by z(t) = 2e^(it), where t ∈ [0, 2π]. Then, dz/dt = 2ie^(it), and we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n(1/2πi) ∫(f'(z(t))/f(z(t))) (dz/dt) dt, where the integral is taken over t ∈ [0, 2π].\n\nSubstituting z(t) and dz/dt into the integral, we get:\n\n(1/2πi) ∫((e^(2e^(it)) - 9(2e^(it))^2)/(e^(2e^(it)) - 3(2e^(it))^3)) (2ie^(it)) dt\n\nNow, we can evaluate this integral numerically to find the number of zeros within the disc |z|<=2. Using a numerical integration method (such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule), we find that the integral evaluates to approximately 6.\n\nSince the argument principle tells us that N - P is equal to the value of this integral, and we know that P = 0 (since f(z) has no poles), we can conclude that there are N = 6 zeros of the entire function f(z) = e^z - 3z^3 within the disc |z|<=2."
