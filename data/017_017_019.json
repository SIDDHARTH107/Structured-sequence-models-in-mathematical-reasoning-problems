    "message_2": "Let's denote the element of order 15 in G as a. Since the order of a is 15, we know that the subgroup generated by a, denoted as ⟨a⟩, has order 15. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group, so the order of any subgroup of G must be a divisor of 30. The divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.\n\nSince G is non-abelian, there must exist an element b in G that does not commute with a, i.e., ab ≠ ba. We know that the order of b cannot be 1 (since b would be the identity element), 15 (since ⟨b⟩ would intersect non-trivially with ⟨a⟩), or 30 (since G would be cyclic and thus abelian). Therefore, the order of b must be one of the divisors 2, 3, 5, 6, or 10.\n\nWe can eliminate the possibilities of the order of b being 3, 5, or 6 as follows:\n\n- If the order of b is 3 or 5, then the subgroup generated by b, ⟨b⟩, would have order 3 or 5, and ⟨a⟩ and ⟨b⟩ would be disjoint except for the identity element. In this case, the product of the orders of ⟨a⟩ and ⟨b⟩ would be 45 or 75, which is greater than the order of G, which is a contradiction.\n- If the order of b is 6, then ⟨b⟩ would have an element of order 2 and an element of order 3. Since the order of a is 15, a has elements of order 3 and 5. Thus, G would have a normal Sylow 3-subgroup and a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, which would force G to be a direct product of these subgroups and thus abelian, which is a contradiction.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that the order of b is 2. Let's show that G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15.\n\nConsider the dihedral group D15, which has order 30 and is generated by two elements r and s, where r has order 15, s has order 2, and srs = r^(-1). We will construct an isomorphism φ: G → D15 as follows:\n\n1. Define φ(a^k) = r^k for all integers k (0 ≤ k ≤ 14).\n2. Define φ(b) = s.\n\nWe need to show that φ is a homomorphism and bijective.\n\nFirst, let's show that φ is a homomorphism. We need to show that φ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b) and φ(ba) = φ(b)φ(a). We have:\n\n- φ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b) since φ(ab) = φ(a)s = r^1s = rs.\n- φ(ba) = φ(b)φ(a) since φ(ba) = φ(b)a = sa = r^(-1)a = r^(-1)r^1 = r^(-1)srs = r^(-1) = srs.\n\nNow let's show that φ is injective. Suppose that φ(x) = φ(y) for some x, y in G. Then x and y must be of the form x = a^k and y = a^l for some integers k and l (0 ≤ k, l ≤ 14), or x = ba^k and y = ba^l for some integers k and l (0 ≤ k, l ≤ 14). In either case, we have:\n\n- If x = a^k and y = a^l, then φ(x) = r^k and φ(y) = r^l. Since r^k = r^l, we have k = l (mod 15), so x = y.\n- If x = ba^k and y = ba^l, then φ(x) = sr^k and φ(y) = sr^l. Since sr^k = sr^l, we have r^k = r^l, so k = l (mod 15), and thus x = y.\n\nFinally, let's show that φ is surjective. Every element of D15 is of the form r^k or sr^k for some integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 14). We have:\n\n- φ(a^k) = r^k for all integers k (0 ≤ k ≤ 14).\n- φ(ba^k) = s(r^k) = sr^k for all integers k (0 ≤ k ≤ 14).\n\nSince φ is a homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15."
