    "message_2": "First, we need to find the parametrization of the 2-dimensional sphere with radius 3. We can use spherical coordinates for this purpose. Let x = 3sin(θ)cos(ϕ) and y = 3sin(θ)sin(ϕ), where θ and ϕ are the polar and azimuthal angles, respectively. Then, the point p = (1, 2) corresponds to θ = π/2 and ϕ = π/2.\n\nNow, we need to express the function f in terms of θ and ϕ. We have:\n\nf(θ, ϕ) = 2(3sin(θ)cos(ϕ))^2 - (3sin(θ)sin(ϕ))^2 = 18sin^2(θ)(2cos^2(ϕ) - sin^2(ϕ))\n\nNext, we need to compute the Laplacian of f in spherical coordinates. The Laplacian in spherical coordinates is given by:\n\nΔf = (1/r^2)∂/∂r(r^2∂f/∂r) + (1/(r^2sin(θ)))∂/∂θ(sin(θ)∂f/∂θ) + (1/(r^2sin^2(θ)))∂^2f/∂ϕ^2\n\nSince f does not depend on r, the first term is zero. Now, we compute the remaining derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂θ = 36sin(θ)cos(θ)(2cos^2(ϕ) - sin^2(ϕ))\n∂/∂θ(sin(θ)∂f/∂θ) = 36cos^2(θ)(2cos^2(ϕ) - sin^2(ϕ)) - 72sin^2(θ)cos(θ)sin(ϕ)cos(ϕ)\n\n∂^2f/∂ϕ^2 = 72sin^2(θ)(cos(2ϕ))\n\nNow, we can compute the Laplacian:\n\nΔf = (1/(9sin(θ)))∂/∂θ(sin(θ)∂f/∂θ) + (1/(9sin^2(θ)))∂^2f/∂ϕ^2\nΔf = (1/9)[(1/sin(θ))(36cos^2(θ)(2cos^2(ϕ) - sin^2(ϕ)) - 72sin^2(θ)cos(θ)sin(ϕ)cos(ϕ)) + (1/sin^2(θ))(72sin^2(θ)(cos(2ϕ)))]\n\nFinally, we evaluate the Laplacian at the point p = (1, 2), which corresponds to θ = π/2 and ϕ = π/2:\n\nΔf(π/2, π/2) = (1/9)[(1/sin(π/2))(36cos^2(π/2)(2cos^2(π/2) - sin^2(π/2)) - 72sin^2(π/2)cos(π/2)sin(π/2)cos(π/2)) + (1/sin^2(π/2))(72sin^2(π/2)(cos(2π/2)))]\n\nΔf(π/2, π/2) = (1/9)[(1)(0 - 0) + (1)(0)] = 0\n\nSo, the Laplacian of f on M at the point p = (1, 2) is 0."
