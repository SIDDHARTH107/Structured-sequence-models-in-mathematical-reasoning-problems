    "message_1": "A company produces two products, X and Y, using two machines, A and B. The production of one unit of X requires 1 hour on machine A and 2 hours on machine B, while the production of one unit of Y requires 2 hours on machine A and 1 hour on machine B. The profit for one unit of X is $5 and the profit for one unit of Y is $6. Machine A is available for only 12 hours per day, and machine B is available for only 16 hours per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit? Use tabu search to find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is used to find the optimal solution in a large solution space. It uses a memory structure called the \"tabu list\" to keep track of previously visited solutions and avoid cycling back to them. In this problem, we will use tabu search to find the optimal production plan for the company.\n\nStep 1: Define the objective function and constraints\nObjective: Maximize profit = 5X + 6Y\nConstraints:\n1. X + 2Y ≤ 12 (Machine A availability)\n2. 2X + Y ≤ 16 (Machine B availability)\n3. X, Y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity)\n\nStep 2: Initialize the tabu list and set the initial solution\nTabu list: An empty list to store visited solutions.\nInitial solution: (X=0, Y=0)\n\nStep 3: Define the neighborhood function\nA neighborhood function generates a set of neighboring solutions from the current solution. In this problem, we can define the neighborhood function as adding or subtracting 1 unit of X or Y, while still satisfying the constraints.\n\nStep 4: Perform the tabu search\n1. Generate neighboring solutions from the current solution.\n2. Evaluate the objective function for each neighboring solution.\n3. Choose the best solution that is not in the tabu list and update the current solution.\n4. Update the tabu list by adding the new solution and removing the oldest one if the list exceeds a certain size.\n5. Repeat steps 1-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or no improvement in the objective function for a certain number of iterations).\n\nAfter performing the tabu search, we find the optimal solution to be (X=4, Y=4). This means the company should produce 4 units of product X and 4 units of product Y to maximize its profit. The maximum profit is 5(4) + 6(4) = $44."
