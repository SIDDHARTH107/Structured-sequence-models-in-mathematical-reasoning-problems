    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. Find the symmetric difference of A and B, then find the Cartesian product of the result with set C = {5, 6}. Next, find the symmetric difference of B and C, and then find the Cartesian product of the result with set A. Finally, find the symmetric difference of the two Cartesian products obtained and show that it is not equal to the symmetric difference of A and B.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in both. In this case, the symmetric difference of A and B is:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of the result with set C = {5, 6}. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set. In this case, the Cartesian product of A Δ B and C is:\n\n(A Δ B) × C = {(1, 5), (1, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and C:\n\nB Δ C = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of the result with set A:\n\nA × (B Δ C) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)}\n\nFinally, let's find the symmetric difference of the two Cartesian products obtained:\n\n((A Δ B) × C) Δ (A × (B Δ C)) = {(1, 5), (1, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's compare this result to the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nAs we can see, the symmetric difference of the two Cartesian products obtained is not equal to the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\n((A Δ B) × C) Δ (A × (B Δ C)) ≠ A Δ B"
