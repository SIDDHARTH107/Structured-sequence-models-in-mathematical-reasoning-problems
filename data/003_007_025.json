    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, and the angle between sides a and b as γ. In our case, a = 8 meters, b = 10 meters, and c = 6 meters. We want to find the angle γ.\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines, we have:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(γ)\n\nPlugging in the values for a, b, and c, we get:\n\n6² = 8² + 10² - 2 * 8 * 10 * cos(γ)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n36 = 64 + 100 - 160 * cos(γ)\n\nNow, we isolate the cos(γ) term:\n\n160 * cos(γ) = 64 + 100 - 36\n\n160 * cos(γ) = 128\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 160:\n\ncos(γ) = 128 / 160\n\ncos(γ) = 0.8\n\nNow, we find the angle γ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of 0.8:\n\nγ = arccos(0.8)\n\nγ ≈ 36.87°\n\nSo, the angle between the sides measuring 8 meters and 10 meters is approximately 36.87°."
