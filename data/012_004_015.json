    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree of the graph G, we can use Kruskal's algorithm. First, we sort the edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n{2,3} -> 2\n{4,5} -> 2\n{1,3} -> 3\n{3,5} -> 3\n{4,6} -> 3\n{2,4} -> 5\n{5,6} -> 5\n{1,2} -> 6\n{3,4} -> 4\n{5,7} -> 7\n{6,7} -> 8\n\nNow, we start adding edges to the minimum spanning tree, making sure not to create any cycles:\n\n1. Add {2,3} -> 2\n2. Add {4,5} -> 2\n3. Add {1,3} -> 3\n4. Add {3,5} -> 3 (skip, as it would create a cycle)\n5. Add {4,6} -> 3\n6. Add {2,4} -> 5 (skip, as it would create a cycle)\n7. Add {5,6} -> 5 (skip, as it would create a cycle)\n8. Add {1,2} -> 6\n9. Add {3,4} -> 4 (skip, as it would create a cycle)\n10. Add {5,7} -> 7\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is formed by the following edges:\n\n{2,3} -> 2\n{4,5} -> 2\n{1,3} -> 3\n{4,6} -> 3\n{1,2} -> 6\n{5,7} -> 7\n\nThe total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 23."
