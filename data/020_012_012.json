    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, X and Y, which require raw materials A and B. Each unit of X requires 6 units of A and 4 units of B, while each unit of Y requires 4 units of A and 5 units of B. If the company has 360 units of A and 300 units of B available, what is the maximum number of products they can produce?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced. The constraints for raw materials A and B can be represented by the following inequalities:\n\n6x + 4y ≤ 360 (raw material A constraint)\n4x + 5y ≤ 300 (raw material B constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the total number of products produced, which is x + y.\n\nFirst, we can solve the inequalities for y:\n\ny ≤ (360 - 6x) / 4\ny ≤ (300 - 4x) / 5\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region for x and y, which is the area where both inequalities are satisfied. We can start by finding the intersection points of the inequalities:\n\n(360 - 6x) / 4 = (300 - 4x) / 5\n\nMultiplying both sides by 20 to eliminate fractions:\n\n5(360 - 6x) = 4(300 - 4x)\n1800 - 30x = 1200 - 16x\n14x = 600\nx = 42.857\n\nSince x must be an integer, we can round down to x = 42. Now, we can find the corresponding value of y:\n\ny ≤ (360 - 6 * 42) / 4\ny ≤ (360 - 252) / 4\ny ≤ 108 / 4\ny ≤ 27\n\nSo, the maximum number of product X that can be produced is 42, and the maximum number of product Y that can be produced is 27. Therefore, the maximum number of products the company can produce is 42 + 27 = 69."
