    "message_1": "Consider a $4 \\times 4$ Latin square where the entries in the first row are $1, 2, 3,$ and $4$, in some order. How many distinct Latin squares can be obtained by filling in the remaining entries?",
    "message_2": "Let's first fix the order of the first row as 1, 2, 3, and 4. We will count the number of Latin squares with this fixed first row and then multiply by the number of possible permutations of the first row.\n\nNow, let's fill in the second row. Since the first row is fixed, the second row must be a permutation of 2, 3, 4, and 1. There are 3! = 6 possible permutations for the second row.\n\nNext, let's fill in the third row. The first two rows determine the possible entries for the third row. There are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: The second row has the form (2, 3, 4, 1). In this case, the third row must be a permutation of 3, 4, 1, and 2. There are 2 possible permutations: (3, 4, 1, 2) and (4, 1, 2, 3).\n\nCase 2: The second row has any other form. In this case, there are 2 possible permutations for the third row.\n\nSo, for each of the 6 possible second rows, there are either 2 or 3 possible third rows. The total number of possible third rows is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14.\n\nFinally, let's fill in the fourth row. Since the first three rows are fixed, the fourth row is uniquely determined. Therefore, there is only 1 possible permutation for the fourth row.\n\nNow, we need to account for the different possible orders of the first row. There are 4! = 24 possible permutations for the first row. So, the total number of distinct Latin squares is 24 (number of first row permutations) * 14 (number of third row permutations given the first row) = 336."
