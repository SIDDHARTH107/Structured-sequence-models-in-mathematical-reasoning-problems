    "message_2": "The clique number of a graph is the size of the largest complete subgraph (i.e., the largest group of vertices in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge). Let's analyze the given graph:\n\nVertices: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\nEdges: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE, DF, EF, FG\n\nWe can start by looking for cliques of size 4 or larger. However, since vertex G has only one edge (FG), it cannot be part of a clique larger than 2. Similarly, vertex H has no edges, so it cannot be part of any clique. Therefore, we can focus on finding the largest clique among the remaining vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F).\n\nNow, let's look for cliques of size 3:\n\n1. A is connected to B, C, and D. The subgraph ABC is a clique of size 3, as all pairs of vertices are connected (AB, AC, BC).\n2. B is connected to A, C, D, and E. We already found the clique ABC. The subgraph BDE is also a clique of size 3, as all pairs of vertices are connected (BD, BE, DE).\n3. C is connected to A, B, D, and E. We already found the clique ABC. The subgraph CDE is also a clique of size 3, as all pairs of vertices are connected (CD, CE, DE).\n4. D is connected to A, B, C, E, and F. We already found the cliques BDE and CDE.\n5. E is connected to B, C, D, and F. We already found the cliques BDE and CDE.\n6. F is connected to D, E, and G. The subgraph DEF is a clique of size 3, as all pairs of vertices are connected (DE, DF, EF).\n\nWe found four cliques of size 3: ABC, BDE, CDE, and DEF. Since there are no cliques of size 4 or larger, the clique number of the graph is 3."
