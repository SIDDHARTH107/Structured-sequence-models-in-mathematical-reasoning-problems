    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. The profits per unit for X and Y are $30 and $20, respectively. The production cost for each product is $450 for X and $300 for Y. The company has a daily production capacity of 120 units.\n\nUsing the Grey Wolf Optimizer, what is the optimal number of units to produce for each product so the company can maximize its daily profit?",
    "message_2": "The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is used to solve complex optimization problems. However, the problem you presented can be solved using linear programming, which is a more straightforward approach.\n\nLet x be the number of units of product X and y be the number of units of product Y. The objective function to maximize is the total profit:\n\nP = 30x + 20y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx + y ≤ 120 (production capacity constraint)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this linear programming problem, we can use the graphical method. First, we'll plot the constraint inequalities on a coordinate plane:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 120\n2. x ≥ 0\n3. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. In this case, it's the triangle with vertices (0,0), (120,0), and (0,120).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 30(0) + 20(0) = 0\n2. P(120,0) = 30(120) + 20(0) = 3600\n3. P(0,120) = 30(0) + 20(120) = 2400\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at vertex (120,0), which means the company should produce 120 units of product X and 0 units of product Y to maximize its daily profit. The maximum daily profit will be $3600."
