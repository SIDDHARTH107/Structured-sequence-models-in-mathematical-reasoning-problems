    "message_2": "A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the set, and no two edges share a common vertex.\n\nIn the given graph, one possible perfect matching is:\n\n- Edge connecting vertices 1 and 2\n- Edge connecting vertices 3 and 4\n- Edge connecting vertices 5 and 6\n\nThis perfect matching covers all the vertices, and each vertex is connected to exactly one edge in the set."
