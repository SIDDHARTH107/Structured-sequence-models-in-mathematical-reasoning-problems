    "message_2": "The phase shift of a trigonometric function is the horizontal shift of the function along the x-axis. For the given function y = 2sin(3x - π/4), the phase shift can be found by setting the argument of the sine function equal to zero:\n\n3x - π/4 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n3x = π/4\nx = (π/4) / 3\nx = π/12\n\nThe phase shift of the function y = 2sin(3x - π/4) is π/12."
