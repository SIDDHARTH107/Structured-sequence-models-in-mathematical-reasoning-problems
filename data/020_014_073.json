    "message_1": "A manufacturer has to produce 2000 units of a particular product. The cost function of producing each unit is given by  𝐶(𝑥)=0.005(𝑥^3)−2(𝑥^2)+400𝑥+200, where 𝑥 is the number of units produced. However, due to certain technical constraints, the manufacturer can only produce between 400 to 600 units in one production run. Determine the number of production runs required to minimize the total cost of production.",
    "message_2": "To minimize the total cost of production, we need to find the optimal number of units to produce in each production run within the given constraint of 400 to 600 units. \n\nFirst, let's find the critical points of the cost function by taking the derivative with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\nC'(x) = 0.015(x^2) - 4x + 400\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points within the interval [400, 600]. We can do this by solving the quadratic equation:\n\n0.015(x^2) - 4x + 400 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(-4) ± √((-4)^2 - 4(0.015)(400))) / (2 * 0.015)\n\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 24)) / 0.03\n\nSince the discriminant (16 - 24) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. This means that the minimum cost occurs at one of the endpoints of the interval [400, 600].\n\nNow, we need to compare the cost of producing 400 units and 600 units in one production run:\n\nC(400) = 0.005(400^3) - 2(400^2) + 400(400) + 200 = 120,200\nC(600) = 0.005(600^3) - 2(600^2) + 400(600) + 200 = 260,200\n\nSince the cost of producing 400 units is lower than the cost of producing 600 units, the manufacturer should produce 400 units in each production run to minimize the total cost.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of production runs required to produce 2000 units:\n\nNumber of production runs = Total units required / Units per production run = 2000 / 400 = 5\n\nTherefore, the manufacturer needs 5 production runs to minimize the total cost of production."
