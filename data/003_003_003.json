    "message_2": "Using the unit circle to find trigonometric values, sin(π/3) is equal to sin(60°). In a unit circle, sin(θ) represents the y-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the circle. For a 60° angle, the y-coordinate is √3/2. Therefore, sin(π/3) = sin(60°) = √3/2."
