    "message_1": "A certain type of computer system failure occurs at a rate of 0.005 per hour. What is the probability that this type of failure will occur at least once during a 24-hour period?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events (in this case, computer system failures) occurring in a fixed interval of time (24 hours).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given time period, λ is the average rate of events per time period, e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, the rate of failure is 0.005 per hour, and we want to find the probability of at least one failure occurring in a 24-hour period. To find this probability, we can first find the probability of no failures occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of no failures (k = 0) in a 24-hour period:\n\nλ = 0.005 failures per hour * 24 hours = 0.12 failures per 24-hour period\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.12) * 0.12^0) / 0! = (e^(-0.12) * 1) / 1 = e^(-0.12)\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one failure, which is the complement of the probability of no failures:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-0.12)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 1 - 0.8878 = 0.1122\n\nSo, the probability that this type of failure will occur at least once during a 24-hour period is approximately 0.1122 or 11.22%."
