    "message_2": "To determine if the graph G contains a Hamiltonian cycle, we can try to find a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. Let's label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F, corresponding to the rows and columns of the adjacency matrix.\n\nWe can start at vertex A and try to find a Hamiltonian cycle:\n\n1. A → B → C → E → D → F → A\n\nThis cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex A. Therefore, the graph G contains a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\nThe Hamiltonian cycle is: A → B → C → E → D → F → A."
