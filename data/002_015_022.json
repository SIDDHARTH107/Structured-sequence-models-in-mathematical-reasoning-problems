    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter is given as 70 meters, the radius is half of that, which is 35 meters.\n\nC = 2 * 3.14159 * 35\nC ≈ 219.9115\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the park is approximately 219.91 meters."
