    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(x) + 5cos(x) with respect to x, we'll differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe derivative of sin(x) with respect to x is cos(x), and the derivative of cos(x) with respect to x is -sin(x).\n\nSo, the derivative of y with respect to x, denoted as y'(x) or dy/dx, is:\n\ny'(x) = 3cos(x) - 5sin(x)\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the derivative at x = π/2:\n\ny'(π/2) = 3cos(π/2) - 5sin(π/2)\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1, we have:\n\ny'(π/2) = 3(0) - 5(1) = -5\n\nSo, the derivative of y = 3sin(x) + 5cos(x) at x = π/2 is -5."
