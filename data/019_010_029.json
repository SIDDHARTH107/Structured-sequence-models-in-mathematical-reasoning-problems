    "message_1": "Consider the following linear logic formula: A ⊗ B ⊸ C, where ⊗ denotes the additive conjunction and ⊸ denotes the linear implication. If A and B are true with a degree of confidence of 0.6 and 0.3 respectively, and the degree of confidence of C is 0.8, what is the degree of confidence of the formula A ⊗ B ⊸ C?",
    "message_2": "In linear logic, the additive conjunction (⊗) and linear implication (⊸) are not directly related to probability or degree of confidence. However, we can try to interpret the given information in terms of probability to provide an answer.\n\nLet's assume that the degree of confidence represents the probability of each statement being true. In this case, we have:\n\nP(A) = 0.6\nP(B) = 0.3\nP(C) = 0.8\n\nThe formula A ⊗ B ⊸ C can be interpreted as \"if A and B are true, then C is true.\" To find the degree of confidence of this formula, we can first find the probability of A and B being true together, which is given by the joint probability P(A and B). Assuming independence, we have:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that C is true given that A and B are true. This can be represented as P(C | A and B). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:\n\nP(C | A and B) = P(A and B | C) * P(C) / P(A and B)\n\nWe are given P(C) = 0.8, but we don't have enough information to determine P(A and B | C). However, since we are looking for the degree of confidence of the formula A ⊗ B ⊸ C, we can make an assumption that if A and B are true, then C is true with a high degree of confidence. In this case, let's assume P(A and B | C) = 1.\n\nNow we can calculate P(C | A and B):\n\nP(C | A and B) = 1 * 0.8 / 0.18 ≈ 4.44\n\nHowever, probabilities cannot be greater than 1. This means that our assumption of P(A and B | C) = 1 is not valid in this context. Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot determine the exact degree of confidence of the formula A ⊗ B ⊸ C."
