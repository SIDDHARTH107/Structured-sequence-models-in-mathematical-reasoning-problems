    "message_2": "To determine whether the statement \"There exists an element in A that is not in B\" is true or false using intuitionistic logic, we need to examine the elements in set A and check if any of them are not in set B.\n\nSet A = {2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet B = {3, 5, 7, 11}\n\nComparing the elements in both sets, we can see that:\n\n- 2 is in A but not in B\n- 3 is in both A and B\n- 4 is in A but not in B\n- 5 is in both A and B\n\nSince there are elements in A (specifically, 2 and 4) that are not in B, the statement \"There exists an element in A that is not in B\" is true."
