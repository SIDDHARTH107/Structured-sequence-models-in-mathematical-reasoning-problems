    "message_1": "A company has a production process that involves two distinct stages. Each stage can be staffed by one of two workers, worker A or worker B. Worker A can complete the first stage in 4 hours and the second stage in 5 hours. Worker B can complete the first stage in 5 hours and the second stage in 4 hours. If the company needs to produce 100 units of a product, how many hours should they allocate to each worker to minimize the total time needed to complete the production process? Also, determine the total time needed to complete the production process.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units produced by worker A and y be the number of units produced by worker B. Since the company needs to produce 100 units, we have:\n\nx + y = 100\n\nNow, let's find the time needed for each worker to produce x and y units, respectively.\n\nFor worker A, the time needed for the first stage is (4 hours/unit) * x units = 4x hours, and for the second stage, it's (5 hours/unit) * x units = 5x hours.\n\nFor worker B, the time needed for the first stage is (5 hours/unit) * y units = 5y hours, and for the second stage, it's (4 hours/unit) * y units = 4y hours.\n\nThe total time needed for the production process is the sum of the time needed for each worker:\n\nTotal time = 4x + 5x + 5y + 4y = 9x + 9y\n\nSince x + y = 100, we can rewrite the equation for the total time as:\n\nTotal time = 9x + 9(100 - x) = 9x + 900 - 9x\n\nTotal time = 900\n\nTo minimize the total time needed to complete the production process, the company should allocate the work evenly between the two workers. This means that each worker should produce 50 units of the product:\n\nx = 50 (worker A)\ny = 50 (worker B)\n\nThe total time needed to complete the production process is 900 hours."
