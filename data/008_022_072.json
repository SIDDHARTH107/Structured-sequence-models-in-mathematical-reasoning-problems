    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n| 2  3 | 10 |\n| 4  6.1 | 24 |\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to solve the system. We will start by dividing the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  1.5 | 5 |\n| 4  6.1 | 24 |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the 4 in the second row by subtracting 4 times the first row from the second row:\n\n| 1  1.5 | 5 |\n| 0  0.1 | 4 |\n\nNow, we will divide the second row by 0.1 to get a leading 1:\n\n| 1  1.5 | 5 |\n| 0  1 | 40 |\n\nFinally, we will eliminate the 1.5 in the first row by subtracting 1.5 times the second row from the first row:\n\n| 1  0 | -55 |\n| 0  1 | 40 |\n\nThe resulting matrix represents the system of equations x = -55 and y = 40. Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = -55 and y = 40."
