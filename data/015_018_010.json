    "message_2": "To solve the Duffing oscillator equation, we can use numerical methods, as there is no general closed-form solution for this non-linear differential equation. One common numerical method is the Runge-Kutta method. Here, we will use the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve the given Duffing oscillator equation.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the second-order differential equation as a system of two first-order differential equations:\n\n1. x'(t) = y(t)\n2. y'(t) = -δy(t) - αx(t) - βx(t)^3 + γ cos(ωt)\n\nNow, let's implement the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve this system of equations:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Parameters\ndelta = 0.1\nalpha = 1\nbeta = -1\ngamma = 0.3\nomega = 1.2\n\n# Initial conditions\nx0 = 0.5\ny0 = 0.1\n\n# Time settings\nt0 = 0\ntf = 50\ndt = 0.01\nn = int((tf - t0) / dt)\n\n# Functions\ndef dxdt(t, x, y):\n    return y\n\ndef dydt(t, x, y):\n    return -delta * y - alpha * x - beta * x**3 + gamma * np.cos(omega * t)\n\n# 4th order Runge-Kutta method\nt = np.linspace(t0, tf, n)\nx = np.zeros(n)\ny = np.zeros(n)\nx[0] = x0\ny[0] = y0\n\nfor i in range(n - 1):\n    k1_x = dxdt(t[i], x[i], y[i])\n    k1_y = dydt(t[i], x[i], y[i])\n    \n    k2_x = dxdt(t[i] + dt / 2, x[i] + k1_x * dt / 2, y[i] + k1_y * dt / 2)\n    k2_y = dydt(t[i] + dt / 2, x[i] + k1_x * dt / 2, y[i] + k1_y * dt / 2)\n    \n    k3_x = dxdt(t[i] + dt / 2, x[i] + k2_x * dt / 2, y[i] + k2_y * dt / 2)\n    k3_y = dydt(t[i] + dt / 2, x[i] + k2_x * dt / 2, y[i] + k2_y * dt / 2)\n    \n    k4_x = dxdt(t[i] + dt, x[i] + k3_x * dt, y[i] + k3_y * dt)\n    k4_y = dydt(t[i] + dt, x[i] + k3_x * dt, y[i] + k3_y * dt)\n    \n    x[i + 1] = x[i] + (k1_x + 2 * k2_x + 2 * k3_x + k4_x) * dt / 6\n    y[i + 1] = y[i] + (k1_y + 2 * k2_y + 2 * k3_y + k4_y) * dt / 6\n\n# Plotting the solution\nplt.plot(t, x)\nplt.xlabel('Time (t)')\nplt.ylabel('Position (x)')\nplt.title('Duffing Oscillator')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis Python code will generate a plot of the position x(t) of the Duffing oscillator over time. Note that the solution is an approximation, as we are using a numerical method to solve the non-linear differential equation."
