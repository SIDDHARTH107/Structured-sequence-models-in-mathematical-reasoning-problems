    "message_2": "a) To determine the total impedance of the RLC circuit, we first need to find the reactance of the capacitor and the inductor.\n\nThe reactance of the capacitor (X_C) is given by the formula:\n\nX_C = 1 / (2 * π * f * C)\n\nwhere f is the frequency (50 Hz) and C is the capacitance (3 µF = 3 * 10^-6 F).\n\nX_C = 1 / (2 * π * 50 * 3 * 10^-6)\nX_C ≈ 1060.66 Ω\n\nThe reactance of the inductor (X_L) is given by the formula:\n\nX_L = 2 * π * f * L\n\nwhere L is the inductance (0.05 H).\n\nX_L = 2 * π * 50 * 0.05\nX_L ≈ 15.71 Ω\n\nNow we can find the total impedance (Z) using the formula:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2)\n\nwhere R is the resistance (200 Ω).\n\nZ = √(200^2 + (15.71 - 1060.66)^2)\nZ ≈ 208.97 Ω\n\nb) To find the maximum current that flows through the circuit, we can use Ohm's law:\n\nI_max = V_max / Z\n\nwhere V_max is the maximum voltage (12 V).\n\nI_max = 12 / 208.97\nI_max ≈ 0.057 A\n\nc) To calculate the phase angle (ϕ) between the current and voltage, we can use the formula:\n\nϕ = arctan((X_L - X_C) / R)\n\nϕ = arctan((15.71 - 1060.66) / 200)\nϕ ≈ -1.46 radians\n\nTo convert radians to degrees:\n\nϕ ≈ -1.46 * (180 / π)\nϕ ≈ -83.6°\n\nSo, the phase angle between the current and voltage is approximately -83.6°."
