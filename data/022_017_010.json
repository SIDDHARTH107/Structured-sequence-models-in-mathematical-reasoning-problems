    "message_2": "To find the general solution to the given complex differential equation, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is obtained by replacing the derivatives with powers of a variable, say $r$. So, we have:\n\n$r^2 + 2r + 5 = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn our case, $a = 1$, $b = 2$, and $c = 5$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$r = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(5)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$r = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{-16}}{2}$\n\n$r = -1 \\pm 2i$\n\nNow that we have the roots, we can write the general solution to the complex differential equation as:\n\n$z(t) = C_1 e^{(-1 + 2i)t} + C_2 e^{(-1 - 2i)t}$\n\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are arbitrary complex constants."
