    "message_2": "To disconnect an undirected graph, we need to ensure that there is no path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we need to create at least one isolated vertex or separate the graph into two or more disconnected subgraphs.\n\nThe minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph can be found using the concept of vertex connectivity. The vertex connectivity (k) of a graph is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed to disconnect the graph.\n\nUsing Menger's theorem, we can relate vertex connectivity (k) to edge connectivity (λ) as follows:\n\nk ≤ λ\n\nEdge connectivity (λ) is the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph.\n\nIn our case, we have 8 vertices, and we want to find the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph.\n\nLet's consider the most connected graph with 8 vertices, which is a complete graph (K8). In a complete graph, each vertex is connected to every other vertex. The number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is given by the formula:\n\nE = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nFor our graph with 8 vertices:\n\nE = 8 * (8 - 1) / 2 = 8 * 7 / 2 = 28\n\nHowever, our graph has only 12 edges, which means it's not a complete graph. The maximum vertex degree in our graph is 7 (since it's less connected than K8). Let's assume that there is a vertex with a degree of 7 (connected to all other vertices). To disconnect the graph, we need to remove all 7 edges connected to this vertex. This will create an isolated vertex and disconnect the graph.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph is 7."
