    "message_1": "A company wants to plan its production schedule for the next month. The production can be of two types of products: Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of production time and earns a profit of $20, while each unit of Product B requires 3 hours of production time and earns a profit of $30. The company has a total of 200 production hours available for the next month. However, the company's machinery cannot produce fractional amounts of either product type. How many units of each product should the company produce in the next month to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe total production time constraint can be represented as:\n2x + 3y ≤ 200\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit, which can be represented as:\nProfit = 20x + 30y\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the graphical method by finding the feasible region and then testing the corner points to find the maximum profit.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the inequality:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 200\n\nTo graph the inequality, we can find the intercepts:\n\nWhen x = 0:\n2(0) + 3y = 200\ny = 200/3 ≈ 66.67\n\nWhen y = 0:\n2x + 3(0) = 200\nx = 100\n\nSo, the intercepts are (0, 66.67) and (100, 0). We can now graph the line 2x + 3y = 200 and shade the area below the line, since we want the production time to be less than or equal to 200 hours.\n\nThe feasible region will be a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 66.67), and (100, 0). Since the company cannot produce fractional amounts of products, we need to find the integer coordinates within the feasible region.\n\nThe corner points of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 66), and (100, 0). Now we will test these points to find the maximum profit:\n\n1. (0, 0): Profit = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\n2. (0, 66): Profit = 20(0) + 30(66) = $1980\n3. (100, 0): Profit = 20(100) + 30(0) = $2000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 100 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B, resulting in a profit of $2000."
