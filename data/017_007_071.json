    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 6 is isomorphic to either C6 or D3, we will first use the Sylow Theorems to analyze the possible structure of G. Then, we will construct the isomorphisms for each case.\n\nBy the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of G must divide the order of G, which is 6. Let n_2 and n_3 be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups, respectively. Then, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 6 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n2. n_3 divides 6 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce that n_2 = 1 or 3, and n_3 = 1. Since there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup, it must be normal in G. Let P be this normal Sylow 3-subgroup. P has order 3, so it is isomorphic to C3.\n\nNow, consider the two possible cases for n_2:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, which must also be normal in G. Let Q be this normal Sylow 2-subgroup. Q has order 2, so it is isomorphic to C2.\n\nSince P and Q are both normal in G, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, we have |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 6. Thus, PQ = G. Since P is isomorphic to C3 and Q is isomorphic to C2, G is isomorphic to the direct product C3 x C2, which is the cyclic group C6.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, none of which are normal in G. Let Q1, Q2, and Q3 be these Sylow 2-subgroups, each of order 2. Since P is normal in G, we can form the semi-direct product of P and Qi for each i = 1, 2, 3. Let Hi = P ⋊ Qi.\n\nEach Hi has order 6, so it is isomorphic to either C6 or D3. However, we have already shown that if G is isomorphic to C6, then there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, which contradicts the assumption that n_2 = 3. Therefore, each Hi must be isomorphic to D3. Since G has the same order as Hi, G must also be isomorphic to D3.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a group G of order 6 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C6 or the dihedral group D3, depending on the number of Sylow 2-subgroups."
