    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem related to moral hazard in game theory:\n\nTwo individuals, Amy and Bill, run an insurance company together. Amy is responsible for setting premiums and Bill is responsible for handling claims. They both have perfect information about the company's finances and customers. If the premiums are too high, customers will go to a competitor, but if the premiums are too low, the company may go bankrupt. If a claim is filed, Bill can either process it honestly or he can exaggerate the amount of the claim in order to maximize his own profits. \n\nAssume that the insurance company has 100 customers and each customer has a 10% chance of filing a claim with an average value of $500. The cost of processing a claim is $100. The total amount of premiums collected is $50,000. The cost of running the company (excluding claims payouts and processing costs) is $5,000. \n\nIf Amy sets premiums at $550 per customer and Bill processes claims honestly, what is the expected profit of the insurance company? If Bill exaggerates just one claim by $200, what is the new expected profit of the insurance company?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the expected profit of the insurance company when Amy sets premiums at $550 per customer and Bill processes claims honestly.\n\nTotal premiums collected: 100 customers * $550/customer = $55,000\n\nExpected number of claims: 100 customers * 10% chance of filing a claim = 10 claims\n\nExpected claims payout: 10 claims * $500/claim = $5,000\n\nClaims processing cost: 10 claims * $100/claim = $1,000\n\nTotal cost (claims payout, processing cost, and company running cost): $5,000 + $1,000 + $5,000 = $11,000\n\nExpected profit: Total premiums collected - Total cost = $55,000 - $11,000 = $44,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit if Bill exaggerates just one claim by $200.\n\nNew claims payout: ($5,000 + $200) = $5,200\n\nTotal cost (new claims payout, processing cost, and company running cost): $5,200 + $1,000 + $5,000 = $11,200\n\nNew expected profit: Total premiums collected - Total cost = $55,000 - $11,200 = $43,800\n\nSo, if Bill exaggerates just one claim by $200, the new expected profit of the insurance company is $43,800."
