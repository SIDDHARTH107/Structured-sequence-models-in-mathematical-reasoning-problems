    "message_2": "To find all the rational points on the given elliptic curve, we will use the method of finding a rational parametrization. \n\nConsider the equation of the elliptic curve: $y^2 = x^3 - 2x$. We can rewrite this as:\n\n$y^2 = x(x^2 - 2)$.\n\nNow, let's make a substitution: $x = u^2$ and $y = uv$. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n$(uv)^2 = (u^2)((u^2)^2 - 2)$.\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$v^2 = u^2 - 2$.\n\nNow, let's make another substitution: $v = \\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime integers. Then, we have:\n\n$\\frac{p^2}{q^2} = u^2 - 2$.\n\nRearranging and clearing the denominator, we get:\n\n$p^2 = q^2(u^2 - 2)$.\n\nSince $p^2$ is a square, $q^2(u^2 - 2)$ must also be a square. Let $k^2 = u^2 - 2$, then $u^2 = k^2 + 2$. Now, we have:\n\n$p^2 = q^2k^2$.\n\nSince $p$ and $q$ are coprime, $p = mq$ and $q = np$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. Then, we have:\n\n$(mq)^2 = (np)^2k^2$.\n\nDividing both sides by $q^2$, we get:\n\n$m^2 = n^2k^2$.\n\nNow, we have a Pythagorean triple $(m, n, k)$, and we can use the standard parametrization of Pythagorean triples:\n\n$m = r^2 - s^2$,\n$n = 2rs$,\n$k = r^2 + s^2$,\n\nwhere $r$ and $s$ are coprime integers and $r > s > 0$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $n = 2rs$, and since $q = np$, we have:\n\n$q = 2rsp$.\n\nNow, we can find $x$ and $y$ in terms of $r$, $s$, and $p$:\n\n$x = u^2 = k^2 + 2 = (r^2 + s^2)^2 + 2$,\n$y = uv = \\frac{p}{q}u = \\frac{p(r^2 + s^2)}{2rsp}$.\n\nThus, the rational points on the elliptic curve are given by:\n\n$(x, y) = \\left((r^2 + s^2)^2 + 2, \\frac{p(r^2 + s^2)}{2rsp}\\right)$,\n\nwhere $r$, $s$, and $p$ are coprime integers, and $r > s > 0$."
