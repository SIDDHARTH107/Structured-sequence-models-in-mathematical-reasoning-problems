    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal pattern that doubles the number of segments with each iteration. The length of each segment remains the same throughout the iterations. After the first 6 iterations, the total length of the Dragon curve can be calculated as follows:\n\nInitial length (1st iteration): 1 segment\n2nd iteration: 2 segments\n3rd iteration: 4 segments\n4th iteration: 8 segments\n5th iteration: 16 segments\n6th iteration: 32 segments\n\nTotal number of segments after 6 iterations = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63 segments\n\nSince the length of each segment is 1 unit, the total length of the Dragon curve after the first 6 iterations is 63 units."
