    "message_2": "To show that the given curve is birational to the line $\\mathbb{P}^1$, we need to find a rational map from the curve to the line and a rational map from the line to the curve such that their composition is the identity map.\n\nLet's consider the rational map $\\phi: (x:y:z) \\mapsto (x:y)$ from the curve to the line. This map is well-defined since at least one of $x$ and $y$ must be nonzero for any point on the curve. If both $x$ and $y$ were zero, then $z^3 = 0$, which implies $z = 0$, contradicting the fact that we are in projective space.\n\nNow, let's find a rational map $\\psi: (u:v) \\mapsto (x:y:z)$ from the line to the curve. We can define this map as follows:\n\n$$\\psi(u:v) = (u^3:v^3:(u^2v + uv^2))$$\n\nWe need to check that this map is well-defined and that the image of this map lies on the curve. First, note that at least one of $u$ and $v$ must be nonzero, so the point $(u^3:v^3:(u^2v + uv^2))$ is well-defined in projective space. Now, let's check that the image of this map lies on the curve:\n\n$$f(u^3, v^3, u^2v + uv^2) = (u^3)^3 + (v^3)^3 + (u^2v + uv^2)^3 - 3(u^3)(v^3)(u^2v + uv^2)$$\n\nUsing the identity $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)$, we can rewrite the above expression as:\n\n$$(u^3 + v^3 + (u^2v + uv^2))((u^3)^2 + (v^3)^2 + (u^2v + uv^2)^2 - (u^3)(v^3) - (u^3)(u^2v + uv^2) - (v^3)(u^2v + uv^2))$$\n\nNow, note that $u^3 + v^3 + (u^2v + uv^2) = (u+v)(u^2 - uv + v^2) = 0$, since $u+v = 0$ or $u^2 - uv + v^2 = 0$. Therefore, the image of the map $\\psi$ lies on the curve.\n\nFinally, let's check that the composition of the maps $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ is the identity map. We have:\n\n$$\\phi(\\psi(u:v)) = \\phi(u^3, v^3, u^2v + uv^2) = (u^3:v^3)$$\n\nSince $(u^3:v^3) \\sim (u:v)$ in projective space, the composition of the maps is indeed the identity map. Thus, the curve is birational to the line $\\mathbb{P}^1$, and we have found the birational transformation between them."
