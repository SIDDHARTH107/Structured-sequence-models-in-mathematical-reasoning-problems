    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12 with exactly one element of order 2. Since the order of G is 12, by the Sylow theorems, G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup P. Let Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since there is only one element of order 2 in G, Q must be cyclic and of order 4. \n\nNow, consider the elements of P and Q. Since P is normal in G, we have that PQ is a subgroup of G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, we have that |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 3 * 4 = 12. Thus, G = PQ.\n\nSince G = PQ and Q is cyclic, G is a semidirect product of P and Q. In this case, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of Z3 and Z4, denoted as Z3 ⋊ Z4. This group is non-abelian and has a unique element of order 2.\n\nNow, let's relate G to the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, and the dihedral group D6:\n\n1. C12: The cyclic group of order 12 is generated by a single element of order 12. It is abelian and has more than one element of order 2. Therefore, G is not isomorphic to C12.\n\n2. A4: The alternating group A4 is the group of even permutations of 4 elements. It has order 12 and three elements of order 2. Since G has only one element of order 2, G is not isomorphic to A4.\n\n3. D6: The dihedral group D6 is the group of symmetries of a regular hexagon. It has order 12 and six elements of order 2. Again, since G has only one element of order 2, G is not isomorphic to D6.\n\nIn conclusion, the structure of G is Z3 ⋊ Z4, and it is not isomorphic to C12, A4, or D6."
