    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. To find the minimum size of the vertex cover, we want to cover all the edges with the least number of vertices.\n\nIn this graph, we can observe that vertex 4 is connected to vertices 2, 3, 5, and 6. So, if we include vertex 4 in our vertex cover, we can cover the edges (2,4), (3,4), (4,5), and (4,6). Now, we only need to cover the edges (1,2) and (1,3). We can do this by including vertex 1 in our vertex cover. \n\nThus, the minimum size of the vertex cover for this graph is 2, with the vertex cover being {1, 4}."
