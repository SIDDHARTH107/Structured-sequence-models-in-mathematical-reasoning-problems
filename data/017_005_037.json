    "message_2": "Since G is a group of order 125, we know that |G| = 125 = 5^3. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides 125\n\nThe only possibility for n_5 is 1, which means there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup, say P, of order 5^3 in G. Since P is the unique 5-Sylow subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup of G (by Sylow's Theorem). Now, we consider the factor group G/P.\n\nSince |G| = 5^3 and |P| = 5^3, we have |G/P| = |G|/|P| = 1, which means G/P is the trivial group. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and the trivial group, i.e., G ≅ P × {e}.\n\nNow, we need to determine if P is cyclic. Since P is a p-group (a group of order p^n, where p is prime), we can apply the following result:\n\nA p-group of order p^n is cyclic if and only if it has a unique subgroup of order p^(n-1).\n\nLet's check if P has a unique subgroup of order 5^2 = 25. By the Sylow Theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in P, denoted by n'_5, must satisfy:\n\n1. n'_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n'_5 divides 5^3 / 5 = 5^2\n\nThe only possibilities for n'_5 are 1 and 25. If n'_5 = 1, then P has a unique subgroup of order 25, and P is cyclic. If n'_5 = 25, then P has 25 subgroups of order 25, and P is not cyclic.\n\nHowever, we can apply a result from group theory that states that a group of order p^2 (where p is prime) is always abelian. Since P has order 5^3, it must have a subgroup of order 5^2, say H. Then, H has order 5^2, and by the result mentioned above, H is abelian. Moreover, since H is a subgroup of P, and P is a normal subgroup of G, we have that G is also abelian.\n\nNow, we can conclude that G is isomorphic to a direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25. Since G is abelian, it must be isomorphic to either C_125 (cyclic group of order 125) or C_5 × C_25 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 5 and 25). We cannot determine which one it is without more information about G."
