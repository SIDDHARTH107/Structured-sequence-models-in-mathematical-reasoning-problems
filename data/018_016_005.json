    "message_1": "Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. Find A x B union B x A. Show that the result is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "To find A x B and B x A, we need to find the Cartesian products of the sets A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of A x B and B x A. The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nA x B ∪ B x A = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's check if the result is commutative. Commutativity means that the order of the operation does not matter, i.e., A x B = B x A. In this case, we can see that:\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nA x B ≠ B x A\n\nThe Cartesian product is not commutative because the order of the elements in the ordered pairs matters. In A x B, the first element of each pair comes from set A, while in B x A, the first element of each pair comes from set B."
