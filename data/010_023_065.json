They are asked to compute the fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The student should present their work and provide an answer.",
    "message_2": "To compute the fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, we can use the Wirtinger presentation. The Wirtinger presentation is a method for computing the fundamental group of the complement of a knot using an oriented knot diagram.\n\nFirst, let's draw an oriented diagram of the trefoil knot. The trefoil knot can be represented by the following braid word: σ1σ2σ1, where σ1 and σ2 are the first and second generators of the braid group B3.\n\nNext, we need to choose a base point on the knot, which is not on any of the crossings. Let's call this base point x0.\n\nNow, we will label the arcs in the knot diagram that connect the crossings. We will label them as x1, x2, and x3.\n\nFor each crossing, we will write a relation between the arcs involved in the crossing. The relation will be of the form x_i = x_j * x_k * x_j^(-1), where x_i is the overcrossing arc, and x_j and x_k are the two undercrossing arcs.\n\nFor the trefoil knot, we have the following relations:\n\n1. At the first crossing: x1 = x2 * x3 * x2^(-1)\n2. At the second crossing: x2 = x3 * x1 * x3^(-1)\n3. At the third crossing: x3 = x1 * x2 * x1^(-1)\n\nNow, we can write the Wirtinger presentation of the fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot as:\n\nπ1 = ⟨x1, x2, x3 | x1 = x2 * x3 * x2^(-1), x2 = x3 * x1 * x3^(-1), x3 = x1 * x2 * x1^(-1)⟩\n\nThis presentation is isomorphic to the braid group B3, which is isomorphic to the free group on two generators. Therefore, the fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot is:\n\nπ1 = ⟨a, b⟩\n\nThis is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian and has infinite order."
