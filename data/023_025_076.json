    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series coefficients for the given pressure distribution, we can use the double Fourier series representation:\n\np(x, y) = ∑∑[A_mn * sin(m * π * x/a) * sin(n * π * y/b)]\n\nwhere a = 2 meters, b = 3 meters, and A_mn are the Fourier coefficients.\n\nTo find A_mn, we can use the following formula:\n\nA_mn = (4/(a * b)) * ∫∫[p(x, y) * sin(m * π * x/a) * sin(n * π * y/b) dx dy]\n\nwhere the integration is performed over the rectangle 0 ≤ x ≤ a and 0 ≤ y ≤ b.\n\nFor the given pressure distribution p(x, y) = 10sin(6πx)sin(4πy), we can see that it already has the form of a single term in the Fourier series with m = 6 and n = 4. Therefore, all other coefficients A_mn will be zero except for A_64.\n\nNow, we can find A_64:\n\nA_64 = (4/(2 * 3)) * ∫∫[10sin(6πx)sin(4πy) * sin(6 * π * x/2) * sin(4 * π * y/3) dx dy]\n\nSince the integrand is already in the desired form, we can directly compare it with the formula for A_mn:\n\nA_64 = 10\n\nNow that we have the Fourier series coefficient, we can determine the maximum stress induced in the plate. The maximum stress occurs when the deflection of the plate is maximum. The deflection w(x, y) can be found using the following formula:\n\nw(x, y) = (A_mn * a^2 * b^2) / (D * (m^2/a^2 + n^2/b^2)^2)\n\nwhere D is the flexural rigidity of the plate, which depends on the material properties and thickness of the plate. To find the maximum stress, we need to find the maximum deflection.\n\nSince we only have one non-zero coefficient A_64, the deflection formula simplifies to:\n\nw(x, y) = (10 * 2^2 * 3^2) / (D * (6^2/2^2 + 4^2/3^2)^2)\n\nThe maximum deflection occurs when sin(m * π * x/a) = sin(n * π * y/b) = 1. Therefore, the maximum deflection is:\n\nw_max = (10 * 2^2 * 3^2) / (D * (6^2/2^2 + 4^2/3^2)^2)\n\nThe maximum stress in the plate can be found using the following formula:\n\nσ_max = (6 * D * (m^2/a^2 + n^2/b^2) * w_max) / (a * b)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nσ_max = (6 * D * (6^2/2^2 + 4^2/3^2) * (10 * 2^2 * 3^2) / (D * (6^2/2^2 + 4^2/3^2)^2)) / (2 * 3)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nσ_max = (60 * 2^2 * 3^2) / (6^2/2^2 + 4^2/3^2)\n\nσ_max = (60 * 4 * 9) / (9 + 16/3)\n\nσ_max = 2160 / (43/3)\n\nσ_max = 6480 / 43\n\nσ_max ≈ 150.7 N/m²\n\nTherefore, the maximum stress induced in the plate is approximately 150.7 N/m²."
