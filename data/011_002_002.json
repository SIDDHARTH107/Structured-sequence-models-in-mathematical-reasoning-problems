    "message_2": "To choose 2 out of 7 different colors of shirts, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 7 different colors of shirts), k is the number of items we want to choose (in this case, 2), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, for this problem, we have:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!)\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!5!)\n\nC(7, 2) = (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1)(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(7, 2) = (7 × 6) / (2 × 1)\n\nC(7, 2) = 42 / 2\n\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nSo, there are 21 ways to choose 2 out of 7 different colors of shirts to wear for a week."
