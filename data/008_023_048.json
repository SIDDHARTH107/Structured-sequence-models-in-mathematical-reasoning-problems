    "message_2": "To find the best approximate solution for the given noisy data, we can use the method of least squares. We can rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form as:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y), and B is the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 3  2 |\n    | 4 -5 |\n    | 5  4 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = |  7.5  |\n    | -3.6  |\n    | 12.3  |\n\nTo find the best approximate solution, we can use the normal equation:\n\nA^T * A * X = A^T * B\n\nFirst, we need to find the transpose of matrix A (A^T):\n\nA^T = | 3  4  5 |\n      | 2 -5  4 |\n\nNow, we can find the product of A^T and A:\n\nA^T * A = | 3  4  5 |   | 3  2 |\n          | 2 -5  4 | * | 4 -5 |\n                       | 5  4 |\n\n          = | 50   0  |\n            |  0  45  |\n\nNext, we find the product of A^T and B:\n\nA^T * B = | 3  4  5 |   |  7.5  |\n          | 2 -5  4 | * | -3.6  |\n                       | 12.3  |\n\n          = | 50.1 |\n            | 45.6 |\n\nNow, we can solve the normal equation:\n\n| 50   0 |   | x |   | 50.1 |\n|  0  45 | * | y | = | 45.6 |\n\nDivide each row by the corresponding diagonal element:\n\n| x |   | 50.1 / 50 |\n| y | = | 45.6 / 45 |\n\nSo, the best approximate solution for the given noisy data is:\n\nx ≈ 1.002\ny ≈ 1.013"
