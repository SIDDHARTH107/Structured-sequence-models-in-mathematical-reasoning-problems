The following chart depicts the cost (in thousands of dollars) to transport one unit of product from each warehouse to each retail store:\n\n| Warehouse | Store 1 | Store 2 | Store 3 | Store 4 | Store 5 | Store 6 | Store 7 |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 1         | 8       | 15      | 22      | 17      | 11      | 9       | 13      |\n| 2         | 12      | 9       | 10      | 20      | 16      | 14      | 18      |\n| 3         | 21      | 11      | 14      | 13      | 12      | 17      | 19      |\n| 4         | 10      | 18      | 19      | 11      | 9       | 16      | 14      |\n\nAssuming that each warehouse has a fixed amount of product to allocate, and each retail store has a fixed demand, determine the minimum cost allocation that meets all demands. The warehouse product availability is:\n\n| Warehouse | Product Availability |\n|-----------|----------------------|\n| 1         | 300                  |\n| 2         | 200                  |\n| 3         | 400                  |\n| 4         | 150                  |\n\nAlso, the demand of the retail stores is:\n\n| Store | Demand |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 200    |\n| 2     | 300    |\n| 3     | 150    |\n| 4     | 250    |\n| 5     | 100    |\n| 6     | 200    |\n| 7     | 150    |\n\nWhat should be the allocation of products from each warehouse to each store in order to minimize the cost of transportation while meeting all demands?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the cost of transportation while meeting all demands, we can use the transportation algorithm. The transportation algorithm is an optimization technique used to determine the most cost-effective way to allocate resources from multiple sources to multiple destinations.\n\nStep 1: Create a transportation table with supply and demand values.\n\n| Warehouse | Store 1 | Store 2 | Store 3 | Store 4 | Store 5 | Store 6 | Store 7 | Supply |\n|-----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------|\n| 1         | 8       | 15      | 22      | 17      | 11      | 9       | 13      | 300   |\n| 2         | 12      | 9       | 10      | 20      | 16      | 14      | 18      | 200   |\n| 3         | 21      | 11      | 14      | 13      | 12      | 17      | 19      | 400   |\n| 4         | 10      | 18      | 19      | 11      | 9       | 16      | 14      | 150   |\n| Demand    | 200     | 300     | 150     | 250     | 100     | 200     | 150     |       |\n\nStep 2: Allocate resources using the least-cost method.\n\n1.

Allocate 200 units from Warehouse 2 to Store 2 (9 * 200 = 1800).\n4. Allocate 150 units from Warehouse 3 to Store 3 (14 * 150 = 2100).\n5. Allocate 250 units from Warehouse 3 to Store 4 (13 * 250 = 3250).\n6. Allocate 150 units from Warehouse 3 to Store 7 (19 * 150 = 2850).\n7.
