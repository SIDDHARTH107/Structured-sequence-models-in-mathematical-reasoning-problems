    "message_1": "A thin film of aluminum oxide with a thickness of 200 nm is deposited on a silicon wafer. The wave speed of electromagnetic waves in the aluminum oxide film is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. Using the Fourier transform, what is the range of frequencies of a plane wave in the film?",
    "message_2": "To find the range of frequencies of a plane wave in the aluminum oxide film, we need to consider the possible wavelengths that can fit within the film's thickness. The thickness of the film acts as a boundary condition for the wavelengths that can propagate within it.\n\nThe thickness of the film is 200 nm, which is equal to 200 x 10^(-9) meters. The smallest wavelength that can fit within the film is twice the thickness (due to the standing wave condition), which is 400 x 10^(-9) meters.\n\nNow, we can use the wave speed (v) and the smallest wavelength (λ) to find the highest frequency (f) that can propagate within the film:\n\nv = λf\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for frequency:\n\nf = v / λ\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nf = (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (400 x 10^(-9) m)\n\nf = (3.0 x 10^8 m/s) / (4.0 x 10^(-7) m)\n\nf = 7.5 x 10^14 Hz\n\nThe highest frequency that can propagate within the film is 7.5 x 10^14 Hz. Since the range of frequencies starts from zero, the range of frequencies of a plane wave in the aluminum oxide film is from 0 Hz to 7.5 x 10^14 Hz."
