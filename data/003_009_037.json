    "message_2": "Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, with a = 6 and b = 8 being the sides adjacent to the 45-degree angle. We will use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the third side, c.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, C = 45 degrees, a = 6, and b = 8. First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = 45 * (π / 180) = π / 4\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\nc^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 - 2 * 6 * 8 * cos(π / 4)\nc^2 = 36 + 64 - 96 * (√2 / 2)\nc^2 = 100 - 48√2\n\nSince we are looking for an integer value for the side c, let's check if the expression under the square root is a perfect square:\n\n100 - 48√2 = (10 - 4√2)^2\n100 - 48√2 = 100 - 80√2 + 32 * 2\n100 - 48√2 = 100 - 48√2\n\nSo, the expression under the square root is indeed a perfect square, and we can take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = 10 - 4√2\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 6 + 8 + (10 - 4√2)\nPerimeter = 24 - 4√2\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is 24 - 4√2 units."
