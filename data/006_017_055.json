    "message_1": "A study found that on average, 1 out of every 1000 cars that pass a certain intersection will be involved in a rear-end collision. If 10,000 cars pass through the intersection in a day, what is the probability that at least 10 rear-end collisions will occur that day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, rear-end collisions) in a fixed interval (in this case, a day) given the average rate of occurrence (1 out of every 1000 cars).\n\nThe formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing k events (rear-end collisions)\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of occurrence (number of rear-end collisions per day)\n- k is the number of events we want to find the probability for\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we need to find the average rate of occurrence (λ) for rear-end collisions per day. Since 1 out of every 1000 cars is involved in a rear-end collision and 10,000 cars pass through the intersection in a day, we can calculate λ as follows:\n\nλ = (1/1000) * 10000 = 10 rear-end collisions per day\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least 10 rear-end collisions occurring in a day. To do this, we can find the probability of 0 to 9 rear-end collisions occurring and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least 10 collisions:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9)\n\nWe can calculate the probability of 0 to 9 rear-end collisions using the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for λ and k into the Poisson distribution formula and calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-10) * 10^0) / 0! ≈ 0.000045\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-10) * 10^1) / 1! ≈ 0.00045\nP(X = 2) = (e^(-10) * 10^2) / 2! ≈ 0.00225\nP(X = 3) = (e^(-10) * 10^3) / 3! ≈ 0.00750\nP(X = 4) = (e^(-10) * 10^4) / 4! ≈ 0.01875\nP(X = 5) = (e^(-10) * 10^5) / 5! ≈ 0.03750\nP(X = 6) = (e^(-10) * 10^6) / 6! ≈ 0.06250\nP(X = 7) = (e^(-10) * 10^7) / 7! ≈ 0.08929\nP(X = 8) = (e^(-10) * 10^8) / 8! ≈ 0.11161\nP(X = 9) = (e^(-10) * 10^9) / 9! ≈ 0.12346\n\nNow, we can add up these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 9) ≈ 0.000045 + 0.00045 + 0.00225 + 0.00750 + 0.01875 + 0.03750 + 0.06250 + 0.08929 + 0.11161 + 0.12346 ≈ 0.45236\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least 10 rear-end collisions:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X ≤ 9) ≈ 1 - 0.45236 ≈ 0.54764\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 rear-end collisions will occur in a day is approximately 54.76%."
