    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B and B × A.\n\nA × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}\n= {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nB × A = {(b, a) | b ∈ B, a ∈ A}\n= {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference between A × B and B × A. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.\n\n(A × B) Δ (B × A) = {x | x ∈ (A × B) or x ∈ (B × A), but not both}\n= {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNotice that the symmetric difference is not equal to the Cartesian product of the symmetric differences of A and B, i.e., (A Δ B) × (B Δ A) ≠ (A × B) Δ (B × A).\n\nThe symmetric difference of A and B is:\nA Δ B = {1, 4}\n\nThe Cartesian product of the symmetric differences of A and B is:\n(A Δ B) × (B Δ A) = {(1, 4), (4, 1)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) Δ (B × A) ≠ (A Δ B) × (B Δ A). Therefore, the symmetric difference of two sets is not commutative with respect to Cartesian product."
