    "message_1": "Consider a topological quantum field theory defined over a closed surface S. The partition function of this theory is given by a function Z(q), where q is a coupling constant. Suppose that the value of the partition function at q=2 is known to be Z(2)=5. Find Z(-1), the value of the partition function at q=-1.",
    "message_2": "To find the value of the partition function Z(-1), we need more information about the function Z(q) or the properties of the topological quantum field theory. The given information, Z(2) = 5, is not sufficient to determine the value of Z(-1) without additional context or constraints on the function Z(q). Please provide more information or constraints on the function Z(q) to proceed with the problem."
