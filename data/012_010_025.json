    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum-sized vertex cover is the smallest possible set of vertices that still covers all edges.\n\nIn this graph, we can find a minimum-sized vertex cover by selecting the following vertices: {B, D, F}. This set of vertices covers all the edges in the graph:\n\n- Edge AB is covered by vertex B\n- Edge BC is covered by vertex B\n- Edge BD is covered by vertex B and D\n- Edge CD is covered by vertex D\n- Edge DE is covered by vertex D\n- Edge DF is covered by vertex D and F\n- Edge EF is covered by vertex F\n- Edge FG is covered by vertex F\n\nThus, the minimum-sized vertex cover for this graph is {B, D, F}, and its size is 3."
