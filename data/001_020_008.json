    "message_2": "To find the vertex and slope of the equation y = |x - 3| - 2, we first need to analyze the equation. This is an absolute value function, which has a V-shaped graph. The vertex of the graph is the point where the V-shape changes direction.\n\nThe general form of an absolute value function is y = a|x - h| + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the graph. In this case, the equation is y = 1|x - 3| - 2, so the vertex is (h, k) = (3, -2).\n\nNow, let's find the slope. Since this is an absolute value function, it has two different slopes on either side of the vertex. To find these slopes, we can rewrite the equation as two separate linear equations:\n\n1. For x < 3, the expression inside the absolute value (x - 3) is negative, so |x - 3| = -(x - 3). The equation becomes y = -1(x - 3) - 2, which simplifies to y = -x + 1. The slope for this part of the graph is -1.\n\n2. For x > 3, the expression inside the absolute value (x - 3) is positive, so |x - 3| = x - 3. The equation becomes y = 1(x - 3) - 2, which simplifies to y = x - 5. The slope for this part of the graph is 1.\n\nIn summary, the vertex of the equation y = |x - 3| - 2 is (3, -2), and the slopes are -1 for x < 3 and 1 for x > 3."
