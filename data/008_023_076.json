    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations with noisy data, we can use the least squares method. First, let's rewrite the system in matrix form:\n\nA * X = B\n\nwhere A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column vector of constants:\n\nA = | 2  3  1 |\n    | 4 -2  3 |\n    | 1  2 -1 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10.5 |\n    |  4.8 |\n    |  2.1 |\n\nNow, we can use the least squares method to find the best approximate solution for X. The least squares method involves finding the pseudo-inverse of A, which can be calculated as:\n\nA_pseudo_inverse = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T\n\nwhere A^T is the transpose of A, and (A^T * A)^(-1) is the inverse of the product of A^T and A.\n\nFirst, let's find A^T:\n\nA^T = |  2  4  1 |\n      |  3 -2  2 |\n      |  1  3 -1 |\n\nNext, let's find the product of A^T and A:\n\nA^T * A = | 21 -10  9 |\n          |-10  17 -5 |\n          |  9  -5  11 |\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of the product:\n\n(A^T * A)^(-1) = |  0.0406  0.0194 -0.0291 |\n                |  0.0194  0.0661  0.0097 |\n                | -0.0291  0.0097  0.1078 |\n\nFinally, let's find the pseudo-inverse of A:\n\nA_pseudo_inverse = (A^T * A)^(-1) * A^T = |  0.0406  0.0194 -0.0291 | * |  2  4  1 |\n                                          |  0.0194  0.0661  0.0097 |   |  3 -2  2 |\n                                          | -0.0291  0.0097  0.1078 |   |  1  3 -1 |\n\nA_pseudo_inverse = |  0.1111  0.2222 -0.1111 |\n                   |  0.2222 -0.1111  0.2222 |\n                   | -0.1111  0.2222  0.1111 |\n\nNow, we can find the best approximate solution for X:\n\nX = A_pseudo_inverse * B = |  0.1111  0.2222 -0.1111 | * | 10.5 |\n                            |  0.2222 -0.1111  0.2222 |   |  4.8 |\n                            | -0.1111  0.2222  0.1111 |   |  2.1 |\n\nX = | 1.00 |\n    | 1.00 |\n    | 1.00 |\n\nSo, the best approximate solution for the system of linear equations with noisy data is x = 1.00, y = 1.00, and z = 1.00, to two significant figures."
