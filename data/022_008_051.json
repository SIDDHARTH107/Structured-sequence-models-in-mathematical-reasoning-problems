    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of f(z) in the upper half plane, we can use the argument principle. The argument principle states that for a meromorphic function f(z) in a simply connected domain D, if f(z) has no zeros or poles on the boundary of D, then\n\n∮(∂D) (f'(z) / f(z)) dz = 2πi(N - P),\n\nwhere N is the number of zeros of f(z) inside D, P is the number of poles of f(z) inside D, and the integral is taken over the boundary ∂D of the domain D.\n\nIn our case, f(z) = z^4 - 2z^2 + 5 is an entire function, so it has no poles. We want to find the number of zeros in the upper half plane, so we can choose D to be the upper half plane. The boundary of the upper half plane is the real axis.\n\nLet's compute f'(z):\n\nf'(z) = 4z^3 - 4z.\n\nNow we need to compute the integral\n\n∮(∂D) (f'(z) / f(z)) dz.\n\nSince the boundary of the upper half plane is the real axis, we can parametrize it by z = x + 0i, where x ∈ (-∞, ∞). Then dz = dx, and the integral becomes\n\n∫(−∞, ∞) (f'(x) / f(x)) dx.\n\nNow we can plug in the expressions for f(x) and f'(x):\n\n∫(−∞, ∞) ((4x^3 - 4x) / (x^4 - 2x^2 + 5)) dx.\n\nThis integral is not easy to compute directly. However, we can use the fact that f(z) is an even function (i.e., f(-z) = f(z)) and f'(z) is an odd function (i.e., f'(-z) = -f'(z)). This means that the integrand is an odd function, and the integral over the entire real axis is zero:\n\n∫(−∞, ∞) ((4x^3 - 4x) / (x^4 - 2x^2 + 5)) dx = 0.\n\nAccording to the argument principle, this integral is equal to 2πi(N - P), where N is the number of zeros in the upper half plane and P is the number of poles in the upper half plane. Since f(z) is entire, it has no poles, so P = 0. Therefore, we have\n\n0 = 2πi(N - 0),\n\nwhich implies that N = 0.\n\nSo, there are no zeros of f(z) in the upper half plane with multiplicity."
