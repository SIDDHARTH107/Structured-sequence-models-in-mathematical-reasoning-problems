    "message_1": "In a manufacturing plant, it is known that the probability of a worker sustaining severe injuries in any given month is 0.08. What is the probability that out of a sample of 50 workers, at least 3 workers will sustain severe injuries in a month?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, severe injuries) in n trials (workers)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as \"n choose k\"\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 50 workers)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of workers with severe injuries)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.08)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (in this case, 0.92)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 3 workers will sustain severe injuries, which means we need to find the probability of 3 or more workers sustaining severe injuries. To do this, we can find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 workers sustaining severe injuries and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, we need to calculate P(X = 0), P(X = 1), and P(X = 2), and then find 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)).\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * (0.08)^0 * (0.92)^50\nP(X = 1) = C(50, 1) * (0.08)^1 * (0.92)^49\nP(X = 2) = C(50, 2) * (0.08)^2 * (0.92)^48\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute these values:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.0000023\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.0001217\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.0029644\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 3 workers sustaining severe injuries:\n\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2))\nP(X ≥ 3) = 1 - (0.0000023 + 0.0001217 + 0.0029644)\nP(X ≥ 3) ≈ 1 - 0.0030884\nP(X ≥ 3) ≈ 0.9969116\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 workers out of 50 will sustain severe injuries in a month is approximately 0.9969, or 99.69%."
