    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(3,3) is the smallest integer N such that any complete graph with N vertices and edges colored in red and blue will contain either a complete red subgraph of size 3 or a complete blue subgraph of size 3. \n\nTo find R(3,3), we can use the following formula:\n\nR(m,n) = R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1)\n\nFor R(3,3), we first need to find R(2,3) and R(3,2). Since R(2,n) and R(n,2) are always equal to n, we have:\n\nR(2,3) = 3\nR(3,2) = 2\n\nNow, we can find R(3,3):\n\nR(3,3) = R(2,3) + R(3,2) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the Ramsey number R(3,3) is 5. This means that in any complete graph with at least 5 vertices and edges colored in red and blue, there will always be either a complete red subgraph of size 3 or a complete blue subgraph of size 3."
