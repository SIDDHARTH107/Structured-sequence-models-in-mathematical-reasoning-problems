    "message_2": "The largest circular disk that can be inscribed inside the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set has a diameter equal to the distance between the cusp of the cardioid and the boundary of the set. This distance is 1/4.\n\nSince the diameter is 1/4, the radius of the largest circular disk is 1/8. To find the area of the disk, we use the formula for the area of a circle:\n\nArea = π * r^2\n\nArea = π * (1/8)^2\n\nArea = π * 1/64\n\nArea ≈ 0.04908738521234052\n\nRounded off to two decimal places, the area of the largest circular disk that can be inscribed inside the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is approximately 0.05."
