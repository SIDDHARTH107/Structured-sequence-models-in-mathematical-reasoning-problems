    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from a larger square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 smaller squares, and the middle square is removed. \n\nTo find the total number of squares in the 7th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of squares = (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 7th iteration:\n\nTotal number of squares = (8^7 - 1) / 7\nTotal number of squares = (2097152 - 1) / 7\nTotal number of squares = 2097151 / 7\nTotal number of squares = 299593\n\nSo, there are 299,593 squares in the 7th iteration of the Sierpinski sieve."
