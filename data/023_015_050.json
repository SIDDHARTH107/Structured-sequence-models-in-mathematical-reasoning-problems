    "message_1": "A guitar string is plucked and oscillates with a maximum amplitude of 8 mm. The length of the string is 0.64 m and its mass is 2.2 g. The tension in the string is 600 N. Find the fundamental frequency of the string vibration. Use Fourier transform to solve the wave propagation problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the fundamental frequency of the string vibration, we can use the formula:\n\nf1 = (1 / 2L) * sqrt(T / μ)\n\nwhere f1 is the fundamental frequency, L is the length of the string, T is the tension in the string, and μ is the linear mass density of the string.\n\nFirst, we need to find the linear mass density (μ) of the string. We can do this by dividing the mass of the string by its length:\n\nμ = (2.2 g) / (0.64 m) = 0.0022 kg / 0.64 m = 0.0034375 kg/m\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nf1 = (1 / (2 * 0.64 m)) * sqrt(600 N / 0.0034375 kg/m)\n\nf1 = (1 / 1.28 m) * sqrt(174657.534 N/kg)\n\nf1 = 0.78125 Hz * sqrt(174657.534 N/kg)\n\nf1 ≈ 0.78125 Hz * 417.925 Hz\n\nf1 ≈ 326.4 Hz\n\nThe fundamental frequency of the string vibration is approximately 326.4 Hz.\n\nRegarding the Fourier transform, it is not necessary to use it in this case, as the problem can be solved directly using the formula for the fundamental frequency of a vibrating string. Fourier transform is typically used for analyzing complex waveforms and decomposing them into their constituent frequencies, but in this case, we are only interested in the fundamental frequency of a simple vibrating string."
