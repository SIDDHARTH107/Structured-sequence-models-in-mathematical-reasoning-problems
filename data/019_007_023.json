    "message_1": "Sorry, but I cannot provide a numerical problem for this topic as non-monotonic logic is a mathematical theory used to reason about uncertain or incomplete information based on rules that can be revised or retracted. It is not directly related to numerical calculations. Can I suggest a different topic or area of mathematics for which I can provide a numerical problem?",
    "message_2": "Of course! Here are a few different topics and areas of mathematics for which I can provide numerical problems:\n\n1. Algebra: Solve the equation 3x - 7 = 11.\n2. Geometry: Find the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.\n3. Calculus: Find the derivative of the function f(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 5.\n4. Probability: In a deck of 52 playing cards, what is the probability of drawing a red card (hearts or diamonds)?\n5. Trigonometry: Find the value of sin(30Â°).\n\nPlease let me know which topic you would like to explore, or if you have a specific problem in mind, feel free to provide it."
