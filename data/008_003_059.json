    "message_2": "To find the rank of matrix A, we need to perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form and then count the number of non-zero rows.\n\nMatrix A:\n\\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 & 7 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 6 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2/5 times the first row from the second row, and subtract 1/5 times the first row from the third row.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 & 7 \\\\ 0 & 2.4 & 4.6 \\\\ 0 & 0.8 & 1.6 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by 2.4, and subtract 1/3 times the second row from the third row.\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 & 7 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1.9167 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nNow, the matrix is in row echelon form. There are 2 non-zero rows, so the rank of matrix A is 2."
