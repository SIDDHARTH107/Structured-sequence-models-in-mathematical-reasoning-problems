    "message_2": "G1 and G2 are not isomorphic. Here's why:\n\nFirst, let's analyze the degree of each vertex in both graphs:\n\nFor G1:\n- Vertex 1 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 2 and 3)\n- Vertex 2 has degree 3 (connected to vertices 1, 3, and 4)\n- Vertex 3 has degree 3 (connected to vertices 1, 2, and 4)\n- Vertex 4 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 2 and 3)\n\nFor G2:\n- Vertex 1 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 2 and 4)\n- Vertex 2 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 1 and 3)\n- Vertex 3 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 2 and 4)\n- Vertex 4 has degree 2 (connected to vertices 1 and 3)\n\nFrom the degree sequence, we can see that G1 has two vertices of degree 3, while G2 has no vertices of degree 3. Since the degree sequences are not the same, the two graphs cannot be isomorphic."
