    "message_2": "To find a point on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 (mod 19) that has order 8, we first need to find all the points on the curve. We can do this by iterating through all possible x and y values modulo 19 and checking if they satisfy the equation.\n\nHere's a list of all the points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 (mod 19):\n\n(0, 5), (0, 14), (1, 6), (1, 13), (2, 3), (2, 16), (3, 9), (3, 10), (4, 4), (4, 15), (6, 6), (6, 13), (7, 3), (7, 16), (9, 7), (9, 12), (11, 5), (11, 14), (12, 9), (12, 10), (13, 7), (13, 12), (14, 4), (14, 15), (15, 9), (15, 10), (16, 6), (16, 13), (17, 3), (17, 16), (18, 7), (18, 12)\n\nNow, we need to find a point with order 8. The order of a point P is the smallest positive integer n such that nP = O, where O is the point at infinity and nP is the result of adding P to itself n times.\n\nWe can use the double-and-add algorithm to compute the multiples of each point until we find a point with order 8. After checking the points, we find that the point (1, 6) has order 8:\n\n1 * (1, 6) = (1, 6)\n2 * (1, 6) = (12, 10)\n3 * (1, 6) = (13, 12)\n4 * (1, 6) = (7, 16)\n5 * (1, 6) = (7, 3)\n6 * (1, 6) = (13, 7)\n7 * (1, 6) = (12, 9)\n8 * (1, 6) = O (point at infinity)\n\nSo, the point (1, 6) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 modulo 19 has order 8."
