    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 2000, we need to find the smallest prime number p such that 2^p - 1 > 2000.\n\nLet's test prime numbers starting from 11 (since 2^11 - 1 = 2047, which is greater than 2000):\n\n- p = 11: 2^11 - 1 = 2047, which is not a prime number.\n- p = 13: 2^13 - 1 = 8191, which is a prime number.\n\nSo, the smallest Mersenne prime number greater than 2000 is 8191."
