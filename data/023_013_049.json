    "message_1": "A metal rod, 2 meters in length, initially has a temperature distribution given by T(x) = 20 + 10 sin(πx/L) degrees Celsius, where x is the distance along the rod and L is the length of the rod. If the ends of the rod are kept at a constant temperature of 5 degrees Celsius, use Fourier analysis and the Fourier transform to determine the temperature distribution of the rod at time t when the initial temperature is changed to T(x) = 10 sin(2πx/L) degrees Celsius.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nSince the initial temperature distribution is given by T(x,0) = 10 sin(2πx/L), we will use Fourier analysis to express the solution of the heat equation as a series of sine functions:\n\nT(x,t) = Σ [B_n sin(nπx/L) e^(-αn²π²t/L²)]\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n, we will use the initial temperature distribution:\n\n10 sin(2πx/L) = Σ [B_n sin(nπx/L)]\n\nNow, we will use the orthogonality property of sine functions to find B_n:\n\n∫[0,L] 10 sin(2πx/L) sin(mπx/L) dx = ∫[0,L] B_m sin(mπx/L) sin(mπx/L) dx\n\nBy calculating the integral, we find that:\n\nB_m = (20/L) ∫[0,L] sin(2πx/L) sin(mπx/L) dx\n\nFor m = 2, we have:\n\nB_2 = (20/L) ∫[0,L] sin(2πx/L) sin(2πx/L) dx = 10\n\nFor m ≠ 2, we have:\n\nB_m = 0\n\nSo, the temperature distribution T(x,t) is given by:\n\nT(x,t) = 10 sin(2πx/L) e^(-α4π²t/L²)\n\nNow, we need to account for the fact that the ends of the rod are kept at a constant temperature of 5 degrees Celsius. To do this, we will add a constant term to the temperature distribution:\n\nT(x,t) = 5 + 10 sin(2πx/L) e^(-α4π²t/L²)\n\nThis is the temperature distribution of the rod at time t when the initial temperature is changed to T(x) = 10 sin(2πx/L) degrees Celsius, and the ends of the rod are kept at a constant temperature of 5 degrees Celsius."
