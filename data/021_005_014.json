    "message_2": "To solve the given initial value problem using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the differential equation and the initial condition.\n2. Choose the step size (h) and the range of x values.\n3. Calculate the intermediate values k1, k2, k3, and k4.\n4. Update the y value using the weighted average of the intermediate values.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the desired range of x values.\n\nGiven differential equation: dy/dx = -2xy\nInitial condition: y(0) = 1\nStep size (h): 0.1\nRange of x values: [0, 1]\n\nNow, let's implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n1. Initialize x and y values:\nx = 0\ny = 1\n\n2. Iterate through the range of x values with the given step size:\nfor i in range(10):  # Since we want to find y at x = 1.0, and step size is 0.1, we need to iterate 10 times.\n    k1 = -2 * x * y\n    k2 = -2 * (x + 0.5 * h) * (y + 0.5 * h * k1)\n    k3 = -2 * (x + 0.5 * h) * (y + 0.5 * h * k2)\n    k4 = -2 * (x + h) * (y + h * k3)\n\n    y_new = y + (h / 6) * (k1 + 2 * k2 + 2 * k3 + k4)\n    x_new = x + h\n\n    x = x_new\n    y = y_new\n\nAfter iterating 10 times, we get the value of y at x = 1.0:\n\ny(1.0) â‰ˆ 0.367879\n\nThus, the value of y at x = 1.0 using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of 0.1 is approximately 0.367879."
