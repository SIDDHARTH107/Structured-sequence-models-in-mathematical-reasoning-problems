    "message_2": "To determine the stability of the system using the Fourier transform, we first need to substitute s = jω (where j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency) in the transfer function G(s). This will give us the frequency response of the system, G(jω).\n\nG(jω) = 1/((jω)^2 + 2(jω) + 2)\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n\nG(jω) = 1/(ω^2 - 2jω + 2)\n\nTo analyze the stability of the system, we need to check the poles of the transfer function. Poles are the values of s (or jω) that make the denominator of the transfer function equal to zero. If all poles have negative real parts, the system is stable.\n\nLet's find the poles by setting the denominator equal to zero:\n\nω^2 - 2jω + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in ω. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nω = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2j, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nω = (2j ± √((-2j)^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\n\nω = (2j ± √(4j^2 - 8)) / 2\n\nω = (2j ± √(-8 + 4j^2)) / 2\n\nSince j^2 = -1, we can simplify the expression further:\n\nω = (2j ± √(-8 + 4(-1))) / 2\n\nω = (2j ± √(-4)) / 2\n\nThe square root of a negative number results in a complex number with an imaginary part. This means that the poles of the transfer function have non-zero imaginary parts. However, the real parts of the poles are both zero, which means the system is marginally stable.\n\nIn conclusion, the closed-loop control system with the transfer function G(s) = 1/(s^2 + 2s + 2) is marginally stable."
