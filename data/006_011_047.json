    "message_1": "A factory has 150 employees and 5 out of every 100 employees get injured on the job each year. What is the probability that at least 7 employees will get injured this year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the total number of employees, k is the number of employees getting injured, p is the probability of an employee getting injured, and nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nIn this case, n = 150, p = 5/100 = 0.05, and we want to find the probability that at least 7 employees get injured, which means we need to find the probability for k = 7, 8, 9, ..., 150.\n\nTo find the probability of at least 7 employees getting injured, we can find the probability of 6 or fewer employees getting injured and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X >= 7) = 1 - P(X <= 6)\n\nNow, we need to find P(X <= 6):\n\nP(X <= 6) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + ... + P(X = 6)\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to find the probabilities for each value of k:\n\nP(X = 0) = (150C0) * (0.05^0) * (0.95^150)\nP(X = 1) = (150C1) * (0.05^1) * (0.95^149)\nP(X = 2) = (150C2) * (0.05^2) * (0.95^148)\n...\nP(X = 6) = (150C6) * (0.05^6) * (0.95^144)\n\nNow, we can calculate these probabilities and sum them up:\n\nP(X <= 6) ≈ 0.0114 + 0.0571 + 0.1428 + 0.2142 + 0.2142 + 0.1501 ≈ 0.79\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least 7 employees getting injured:\n\nP(X >= 7) = 1 - P(X <= 6) = 1 - 0.79 = 0.21\n\nSo, the probability that at least 7 employees will get injured this year is approximately 0.21 or 21%."
