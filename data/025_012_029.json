    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line passing through points P(3, 4) and Q(5, 7), we first need to find the slope (m) of the line. The slope can be found using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of points P and Q:\n\nm = (7 - 4) / (5 - 3) = 3 / 2\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nUsing point P(3, 4) and the slope m = 3/2:\n\ny - 4 = (3/2)(x - 3)\n\nDistribute the 3/2:\n\ny - 4 = (3/2)x - 9/2\n\nAdd 4 to both sides:\n\ny = (3/2)x - 9/2 + 8/2\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = (3/2)x - 1/2\n\nNow we have the equation of the line: y = (3/2)x - 1/2\n\nWe are given the elliptic curve equation: y^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2\n\nTo find the point where the line intersects the elliptic curve, we can substitute the equation of the line into the elliptic curve equation:\n\n[(3/2)x - 1/2]^2 = x^3 - 2x + 2\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n(9/4)x^2 - (3/2)x + 1/4 = x^3 - 2x + 2\n\nNow, we need to find the x-coordinate of the intersection point. Since we already have two points on the line (P and Q), we know that the line intersects the elliptic curve at a third point. To find this point, we can set up a polynomial equation by subtracting the left side of the line equation from the right side of the elliptic curve equation:\n\nx^3 - (9/4)x^2 + (5/2)x - 7/4 = 0\n\nNow, we have a cubic polynomial equation:\n\nx^3 - (9/4)x^2 + (5/2)x - 7/4 = 0\n\nWe know that the polynomial has roots at x = 3 and x = 5 (corresponding to points P and Q). We can use synthetic division to find the remaining root.\n\nUsing synthetic division with x = 3:\n\n3 |  1  -(9/4)  (5/2)  -(7/4)\n     |          3    0      15/2\n     ------------------------------\n       1   3/4    5/2    23/4\n\nThe quotient is x^2 + (3/4)x + (5/2), which means the remaining factor is (x - 3).\n\nUsing synthetic division with x = 5:\n\n5 |  1  (3/4)  (5/2)\n     |         5    25/4\n     -------------------\n       1  (23/4)  (45/4)\n\nThe quotient is x + (23/4), which means the remaining factor is (x - 5).\n\nNow, we have factored the polynomial as (x - 3)(x - 5)(x + 23/4) = 0. Since we already know the roots x = 3 and x = 5, the remaining root is x = -23/4.\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the intersection point, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging it into the equation of the line:\n\ny = (3/2)(-23/4) - 1/2\n\ny = (-69/4) - 1/2\n\ny = (-69/4) - 2/4\n\ny = -71/4\n\nSo, the third intersection point is (-23/4, -71/4)."
