    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nQuestion: Consider the rational curve given parametrically by $x(t) = \\frac{5t^2 - 3t - 1}{t^2+1}$ and $y(t) = \\frac{8t^3 - 6t^2 + 3t}{t^3+3t}$. Determine the degree of this curve.\n\nTo solve this problem, the student would need to know the definition of the degree of a rational curve and be able to use properties of rational functions to simplify the expression for the curve and then find the degree.",
    "message_2": "To determine the degree of the rational curve, we need to find the degree of the polynomial that represents the curve when it is expressed in the form of $F(x, y) = 0$. To do this, we will eliminate the parameter $t$ from the given parametric equations.\n\nWe have $x(t) = \\frac{5t^2 - 3t - 1}{t^2+1}$ and $y(t) = \\frac{8t^3 - 6t^2 + 3t}{t^3+3t}$.\n\nFirst, let's solve the equation for $x(t)$ for $t$:\n\n$x(t)(t^2 + 1) = 5t^2 - 3t - 1$\n\n$t^2 + 1 = \\frac{5t^2 - 3t - 1}{x(t)}$\n\n$t^2 = \\frac{5t^2 - 3t - 1 - x(t)(5t^2 - 3t - 1)}{x(t)}$\n\nNow, let's solve the equation for $y(t)$ for $t$:\n\n$y(t)(t^3 + 3t) = 8t^3 - 6t^2 + 3t$\n\n$t^3 + 3t = \\frac{8t^3 - 6t^2 + 3t}{y(t)}$\n\n$t^3 = \\frac{8t^3 - 6t^2 + 3t - y(t)(8t^3 - 6t^2 + 3t)}{y(t)}$\n\nNow we have expressions for $t^2$ and $t^3$ in terms of $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. We can substitute the expression for $t^2$ into the expression for $t^3$:\n\n$t^3 = \\frac{8(\\frac{5t^2 - 3t - 1 - x(t)(5t^2 - 3t - 1)}{x(t)}) - 6t^2 + 3t - y(t)(8(\\frac{5t^2 - 3t - 1 - x(t)(5t^2 - 3t - 1)}{x(t)}) - 6t^2 + 3t)}{y(t)}$\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression and collect terms to find the degree of the polynomial that represents the curve:\n\n$F(x, y) = -40x^3y + 120x^2y^2 - 80xy^3 + 9x^2 - 6xy + y^2 = 0$\n\nThe degree of this polynomial is 3, which is the highest power of the variables $x$ and $y$. Therefore, the degree of the rational curve is 3."
