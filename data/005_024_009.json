The following list shows the quantity of each fruit sold during a week:\n\n- 25 kg of apples\n- 20 kg of bananas\n- 15 kg of oranges\n- 10 kg of grapes\n\nCreate a pie chart to represent the sales data using data mining techniques, and calculate the percentage of each fruit sold during the week.",
    "message_2": "As an AI language model, I cannot create visual images like pie charts. However, I can help you calculate the percentages of each fruit sold during the week, which you can then use to create a pie chart using any data visualization tool or software.\n\nFirst, let's find the total quantity of fruits sold during the week:\n\nTotal quantity = 25 kg (apples) + 20 kg (bananas) + 15 kg (oranges) + 10 kg (grapes)\nTotal quantity = 70 kg\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage of each fruit sold:\n\nPercentage of apples = (25 kg / 70 kg) * 100\nPercentage of apples = 35.71%\n\nPercentage of bananas = (20 kg / 70 kg) * 100\nPercentage of bananas = 28.57%\n\nPercentage of oranges = (15 kg / 70 kg) * 100\nPercentage of oranges = 21.43%\n\nPercentage of grapes = (10 kg / 70 kg) * 100\nPercentage of grapes = 14.29%\n\nNow you can use these percentages to create a pie chart with the following data:\n\n- Apples: 35.71%\n- Bananas: 28.57%\n- Oranges: 21.43%\n- Grapes: 14.29%"
