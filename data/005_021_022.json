If a researcher randomly selects 100 employees, what is the probability that the mean salary of the sample will be between $48,000 and $52,000 using bootstrapping technique?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the mean salary of the sample will be between $48,000 and $52,000 using the bootstrapping technique, we first need to calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM) for the sample. The SEM is calculated as follows:\n\nSEM = (Standard Deviation) / sqrt(Sample Size)\n\nIn this case, the standard deviation is $8,000, and the sample size is 100.\n\nSEM = 8000 / sqrt(100) = 8000 / 10 = 800\n\nNow, we need to calculate the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the desired range ($48,000 and $52,000). The z-score is calculated as follows:\n\nz = (X - Mean) / SEM\n\nFor the lower bound ($48,000):\n\nz_lower = (48000 - 50000) / 800 = -2000 / 800 = -2.5\n\nFor the upper bound ($52,000):\n\nz_upper = (52000 - 50000) / 800 = 2000 / 800 = 2.5\n\nNow, we can use a standard normal distribution table or calculator to find the probability that the sample mean falls between these z-scores. The probability for a z-score of 2.5 is 0.9938, and the probability for a z-score of -2.5 is 0.0062. To find the probability that the sample mean falls between these z-scores, we subtract the lower probability from the upper probability:\n\nProbability = 0.9938 - 0.0062 = 0.9876\n\nTherefore, using the bootstrapping technique, there is a 98.76% probability that the mean salary of the sample will be between $48,000 and $52,000."
