    "message_1": "Suppose that a medical study is conducted to investigate the survival time of patients with a specific disease. The study follows 60 patients for a total of 50 weeks. After the end of the study, it is found that 20% of patients survived for at least 45 weeks. \n\nWhat is the probability that a patient with this disease will survive for at least 45 weeks? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "The probability that a patient with this disease will survive for at least 45 weeks can be calculated using the given information.\n\nNumber of patients in the study = 60\nNumber of patients who survived for at least 45 weeks = 20% of 60\n\nTo find the number of patients who survived for at least 45 weeks, multiply the total number of patients by the percentage:\n\nNumber of patients who survived for at least 45 weeks = 60 * 0.20 = 12\n\nNow, to find the probability, divide the number of patients who survived for at least 45 weeks by the total number of patients:\n\nProbability = (Number of patients who survived for at least 45 weeks) / (Total number of patients)\nProbability = 12 / 60\n\nProbability = 0.20\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the probability that a patient with this disease will survive for at least 45 weeks is 0.20 or 20%."
