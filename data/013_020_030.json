    "message_1": "The Beauty Contest game involves a group of players choosing a number between 0 and 100, with the winner being the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers chosen. If there are 10 players and their chosen numbers are {10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55}, who will be the winner according to the game rules, and what is their winning number?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the average of all the chosen numbers:\n\n(10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30 + 35 + 40 + 45 + 50 + 55) / 10 = 325 / 10 = 32.5\n\nNow, we need to find 2/3 of the average:\n\n(2/3) * 32.5 = 21.6667 (rounded to four decimal places)\n\nNow, we need to find the player whose number is closest to 21.6667. The closest numbers are 20 and 25. The difference between 20 and 21.6667 is 1.6667, and the difference between 25 and 21.6667 is 3.3333. Since 1.6667 is smaller than 3.3333, the winning number is 20.\n\nSo, the winner is the player who chose the number 20."
