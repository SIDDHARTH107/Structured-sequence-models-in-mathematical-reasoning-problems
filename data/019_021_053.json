    "message_1": "In a game of rock-paper-scissors, Player A wins 40% of the time, Player B wins 35% of the time, and they tie 25% of the time. If they play 100 games, what is the expected number of games that Player A will win?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected number of games Player A will win, we can multiply the probability of Player A winning (40%) by the total number of games played (100).\n\nExpected number of games won by Player A = (Probability of Player A winning) × (Total number of games)\n= 0.40 × 100\n= 40\n\nSo, Player A is expected to win 40 games out of 100."
