    "message_1": "A company wants to estimate the average age of its employees. They have a total of 200 employees, but it is impractical to survey all of them. Therefore, the company decides to take a sample of 50 employees. If the sample mean age is 35 years and the sample standard deviation is 5 years, what is the 95% confidence interval for the true mean age of all employees?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true mean age of all employees, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Sample Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 35 years, the sample standard deviation is 5 years, and the sample size is 50 employees. The critical value for a 95% confidence interval with a large sample size (n > 30) is approximately 1.96 (from the Z-table).\n\nConfidence Interval = 35 ± (1.96 * (5 / √50))\n\nFirst, calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 5 / √50 ≈ 0.7071\n\nNext, calculate the margin of error:\n\nMargin of Error = 1.96 * 0.7071 ≈ 1.3859\n\nFinally, calculate the confidence interval:\n\nLower Bound = 35 - 1.3859 ≈ 33.6141\nUpper Bound = 35 + 1.3859 ≈ 36.3859\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true mean age of all employees is approximately 33.61 to 36.39 years."
