    "message_1": "Using the fact that every group of order 36 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, determine which group of order 36 is isomorphic to the following presentation: \n\n⟨a, b | a^9 = b^4 = 1, ba = a^3b⟩",
    "message_2": "To determine which group of order 36 is isomorphic to the given presentation, we can analyze the given relations and compare them to the known structures of the groups of order 36.\n\nThe presentation is given by:\n⟨a, b | a^9 = b^4 = 1, ba = a^3b⟩\n\nFirst, let's look at the orders of the elements a and b. We have a^9 = 1 and b^4 = 1, so the order of a is 9 and the order of b is 4. The order of the group is the least common multiple of the orders of its generators, which is lcm(9, 4) = 36. So, the group has order 36 as expected.\n\nNow, let's analyze the third relation: ba = a^3b. This relation shows that the group is non-abelian since ab ≠ ba. Therefore, we can rule out the cyclic group C36 and the alternating group A4 × C3, as both of these are abelian groups.\n\nNow we need to determine which of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36 the given presentation corresponds to. The nine non-abelian groups of order 36 can be represented by the following presentations:\n\n1. C9 ⋊ C4 (semi-direct product)\n2. C9 ⋊ C4 (another semi-direct product)\n3. C3 ⋊ (C3 × C4)\n4. C3 ⋊ (C3 × C4) (another semi-direct product)\n5. (C3 × C3) ⋊ C4\n6. (C3 × C3) ⋊ C4 (another semi-direct product)\n7. C3 ⋊ (C3 ⋊ C4)\n8. C3 ⋊ (C3 ⋊ C4) (another semi-direct product)\n9. C3 ⋊ (C3 ⋊ C4) (yet another semi-direct product)\n\nThe given presentation has a generator a of order 9 and a generator b of order 4. This suggests that the group is a semi-direct product of C9 and C4. Comparing the given presentation to the presentations of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, we can see that it matches the presentation of the first group:\n\n1. C9 ⋊ C4 (semi-direct product): ⟨a, b | a^9 = b^4 = 1, ba = a^3b⟩\n\nThus, the group of order 36 that is isomorphic to the given presentation is the first non-abelian group of order 36, which is the semi-direct product of C9 and C4, denoted as C9 ⋊ C4."
