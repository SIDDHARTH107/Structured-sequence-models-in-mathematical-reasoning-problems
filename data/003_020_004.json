    "message_1": "A boat is located 300 meters away from the base of a cliff. The angle of elevation from the boat to the top of the cliff is 30 degrees. What is the height of the cliff?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the cliff, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this problem, we have the angle of elevation (30 degrees) and the distance from the boat to the base of the cliff (300 meters). We want to find the height of the cliff, which is the side opposite the angle.\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(30°) = height / 300\n\nFirst, we need to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into our equation:\n\n0.577 = height / 300\n\nTo solve for the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 300:\n\nheight = 0.577 * 300\n\nheight ≈ 173.1 meters\n\nSo, the height of the cliff is approximately 173.1 meters."
