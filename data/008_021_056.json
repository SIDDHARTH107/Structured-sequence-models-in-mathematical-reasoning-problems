    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the method of inverse matrices, we first need to find the inverse of the coefficient matrix. The coefficient matrix is:\n\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\ 3 & 4 & 5 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nTo determine if the inverse exists, we need to find the determinant of the matrix A. If the determinant is non-zero, the inverse exists, and if the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular, and the inverse does not exist.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix A is given by:\n\n$det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)$\n\nFor our matrix A, this is:\n\n$det(A) = 1(15 - 20) - 2(10 - 12) + 3(8 - 9)$\n$det(A) = 1(-5) - 2(-2) + 3(-1)$\n$det(A) = -5 + 4 - 3$\n$det(A) = -4$\n\nSince the determinant of the matrix A is non-zero (-4), the inverse of the matrix A exists. Now we can find the inverse of A and use it to solve the system of linear equations.\n\nHowever, the problem asks to determine if the solution exists or not when the coefficient matrix is singular. In this case, the coefficient matrix is not singular, as the determinant is non-zero. Therefore, we cannot answer the question as it is based on a singular matrix, and our matrix A is not singular."
