    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, you can use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter (d)\n\nGiven the diameter (d) is 10 cm, the formula becomes:\n\nC = π * 10\n\nUsing the value of π as approximately 3.14159, the calculation is:\n\nC = 3.14159 * 10\n\nC ≈ 31.4159 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 31.4159 cm."
