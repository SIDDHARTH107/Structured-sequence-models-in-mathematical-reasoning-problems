    "message_2": "In the Dictator Game, the dictator must offer the receiver more than $10. To maximize the amount the dictator can keep for themselves, they can offer the receiver just slightly more than $10, for example, $10.01. In this case, the dictator can keep $100 - $10.01 = $89.99 for themselves."
