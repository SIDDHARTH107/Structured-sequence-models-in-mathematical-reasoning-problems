    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one earthquake occurring in the next 10 years, we can first find the probability of no earthquakes occurring in the next 10 years and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of no earthquake in a given year is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97.\n\nThe probability of no earthquakes occurring in 10 consecutive years is (0.97)^10.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least one earthquake occurring in the next 10 years by subtracting the probability of no earthquakes from 1:\n\nProbability of at least one earthquake = 1 - (0.97)^10 â‰ˆ 0.262\n\nSo, there is approximately a 26.2% chance of at least one earthquake occurring in the next 10 years."
