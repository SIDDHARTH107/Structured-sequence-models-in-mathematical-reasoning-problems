    "message_2": "There are three distinct groups of order 10: the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, and the non-abelian group of order 10.\n\nTo demonstrate that every group of order 10 is isomorphic to one of these three groups, let G be a group of order 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, where 2 and 5 are prime numbers, by the Sylow theorems, G has a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 2 and a Sylow 5-subgroup Q of order 5.\n\nNow, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in G divides 2 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, there must be exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which implies that Q is a normal subgroup of G. Similarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups in G divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. This means that there can be either one or five Sylow 2-subgroups.\n\nCase 1: There is only one Sylow 2-subgroup.\nIn this case, P is also a normal subgroup of G. Since P and Q are both normal subgroups, their product PQ is also a subgroup of G. Moreover, since P and Q have relatively prime orders, |PQ| = |P| * |Q| = 2 * 5 = 10. Thus, PQ = G. Since P and Q are both cyclic (P has order 2 and Q has order 5), G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is the cyclic group C10.\n\nCase 2: There are five Sylow 2-subgroups.\nIn this case, P is not a normal subgroup of G. However, Q is still a normal subgroup of G. Let x be an element of P and y be an element of Q. Since |x| = 2 and |y| = 5, we have x^2 = e and y^5 = e, where e is the identity element of G. Now, consider the element xy. Since Q is normal in G, we have (xy)^2 = x(yx)y = x(yyx)y = x(yy)x = x^2 = e. Thus, |xy| = 2.\n\nNow, we have two possibilities: either G is abelian or G is non-abelian.\n\nIf G is abelian, then G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is the cyclic group C10, as in Case 1.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then G is generated by x and y, with the relations x^2 = y^5 = e and xy = yx^(-1). This is precisely the presentation of the dihedral group D5.\n\nIn conclusion, every group of order 10 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C10, the dihedral group D5, or the non-abelian group of order 10 (which is also D5 in this case)."
