    "message_2": "To find the complex solutions of the equation z^2 + 2z + 2 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nz = (-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\nz = (-2 ± √(4 - 8)) / 2\nz = (-2 ± √(-4)) / 2\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression under the square root as follows:\n\n√(-4) = √(4 * -1) = √(4) * √(-1) = 2i\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nz = (-2 ± 2i) / 2\n\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the numerator:\n\nz = (2(-1 ± i)) / 2\n\nFinally, we can cancel out the 2 from the numerator and denominator:\n\nz = -1 ± i\n\nThus, the complex solutions of the equation z^2 + 2z + 2 = 0 are z = -1 + i and z = -1 - i."
