    "message_1": "A tower is located on a hill that is 400 meters high. From the top of the tower, an observer sees a boat out at sea at an angle of depression of 20 degrees. What is the minimum distance between the boat and the hill? (Assume that the observer is standing on the ground at the foot of the tower.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. Let's denote the distance between the boat and the hill as x, and the distance between the boat and the observer as y. We can create a right triangle with the hill's height (400 meters), the distance x, and the angle of depression (20 degrees).\n\nSince the angle of depression is 20 degrees, the angle of elevation from the boat to the top of the hill is also 20 degrees. We can use the tangent function to relate the angle, the opposite side (hill's height), and the adjacent side (distance x):\n\ntan(20°) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(20°) = 400 / x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 400 / tan(20°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx ≈ 400 / 0.3640\nx ≈ 1098.9 meters\n\nSo, the minimum distance between the boat and the hill is approximately 1098.9 meters."
