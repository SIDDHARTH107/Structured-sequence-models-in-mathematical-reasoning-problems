    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using separation of variables, we first rewrite the equation as follows:\n\ndy/dx = 2x^3 - 3y^2 + 12\n\nNow, we separate the variables by dividing both sides by (-3y^2 + 12) and multiplying both sides by dx:\n\ndy / (-3y^2 + 12) = (2x^3) dx\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:\n\n∫(1 / (-3y^2 + 12)) dy = ∫(2x^3) dx\n\nLet's solve the integrals separately. For the left side, we can use substitution. Let u = -3y^2 + 12, then du = -6y dy. So, we have:\n\n∫(1 / u) * (-1/6) du = -1/6 ∫(1 / u) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\n-1/6 ln|u| + C1 = -1/6 ln|-3y^2 + 12| + C1\n\nFor the right side, we have:\n\n∫(2x^3) dx = (1/2)x^4 + C2\n\nNow, we can combine the two results:\n\n-1/6 ln|-3y^2 + 12| + C1 = (1/2)x^4 + C2\n\nTo find the general solution, we can combine the constants C1 and C2 into a single constant C:\n\n-1/6 ln|-3y^2 + 12| = (1/2)x^4 + C\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\nln|-3y^2 + 12| = -3(x^4 + 6C)\n\nTaking the exponent of both sides:\n\n|-3y^2 + 12| = e^(-3(x^4 + 6C))\n\nNow, we can remove the absolute value by introducing another constant k, where k = ±1:\n\n-3y^2 + 12 = k * e^(-3(x^4 + 6C))\n\nNow, we can solve for y^2:\n\ny^2 = (12 - k * e^(-3(x^4 + 6C))) / 3\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\ny(x) = ±√((12 - k * e^(-3(x^4 + 6C))) / 3)\n\nThis is the general solution to the given differential equation."
