    "message_1": "A company is testing three different types of laundry detergents to see which is the most effective. They conduct an experiment by randomly selecting 15 different shirts and washing each one with one of the three detergents. The number of stains on each shirt is counted after washing. The results are as follows:\n\n- Detergent A: 4, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1\n- Detergent B: 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2\n- Detergent C: 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1\n\nWhat is the mean number of stains per shirt for each detergent?",
    "message_2": "To find the mean number of stains per shirt for each detergent, we need to sum the number of stains for each detergent and divide by the number of shirts tested for each detergent.\n\nDetergent A:\nSum of stains: 4 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 41\nNumber of shirts: 15\nMean number of stains per shirt for Detergent A: 41 / 15 ≈ 2.73\n\nDetergent B:\nSum of stains: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 31\nNumber of shirts: 15\nMean number of stains per shirt for Detergent B: 31 / 15 ≈ 2.07\n\nDetergent C:\nSum of stains: 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 28\nNumber of shirts: 15\nMean number of stains per shirt for Detergent C: 28 / 15 ≈ 1.87\n\nSo, the mean number of stains per shirt for each detergent is approximately 2.73 for Detergent A, 2.07 for Detergent B, and 1.87 for Detergent C."
