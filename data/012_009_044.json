    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 10 vertices and a degree sequence [3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. Can you draw the graph? If so, draw it. If not, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "It is not possible to draw a graph with the given degree sequence. The reason is that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph must be an even number, as each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices. However, the sum of the given degree sequence is 3+3+3+2+2+1+1+1+0+0 = 16, which is an even number.\n\nHowever, the Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph must be equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 16, which would imply that there are 8 edges in the graph. But, there are three vertices with degree 3, which means that they must be connected to three other vertices. Since there are only two vertices with degree 2, it is impossible to connect the three vertices with degree 3 to the other vertices in the graph without violating the given degree sequence.\n\nTherefore, a graph with the given degree sequence cannot be drawn."
