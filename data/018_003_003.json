A set C is considered a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n1 ∈ A ∪ B (since 1 ∈ A)\n2 ∈ A ∪ B (since 2 ∈ A)\n3 ∈ A ∪ B (since 3 ∈ A)\n\nAll elements of A are in A ∪ B, so A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n2 ∈ A ∪ B (since 2 ∈ B)\n4 ∈ A ∪ B (since 4 ∈ B)\n6 ∈ A ∪ B (since 6 ∈ B)\n\nAll elements of B are in A ∪ B, so A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nThus, we have proven that the union A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} is a superset of both sets A and B."
