    "message_2": "To find the number of zeros of f(z) inside the unit circle |z| = 1, we can use the Argument Principle, which states that for a closed contour C and an analytic function f(z) with no zeros or poles on C, the number of zeros minus the number of poles of f(z) inside C is equal to the change in the argument of f(z) as z traverses C, divided by 2π.\n\nLet C be the unit circle |z| = 1. Since f(z) is an entire function, it has no poles. We need to compute the change in the argument of f(z) as z traverses C.\n\nConsider the function g(z) = f(z)/z = 3z^2 - 2z + 5 - 1/z. This function is analytic inside and on the unit circle, except at z = 0. However, since z = 0 is not a zero or pole of g(z), the Argument Principle still applies.\n\nNow, we need to compute the integral of g'(z)/g(z) around the unit circle:\n\n∮(g'(z)/g(z))dz = ∮( (6z - 2 + 1/z^2) / (3z^2 - 2z + 5 - 1/z) )dz\n\nLet z = e^(iθ), where θ is a real parameter and 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. Then dz = ie^(iθ)dθ, and the integral becomes:\n\n∫( (6e^(iθ) - 2 + 1/e^(2iθ)) / (3e^(2iθ) - 2e^(iθ) + 5 - 1/e^(iθ)) )ie^(iθ)dθ from 0 to 2π\n\nThis integral is difficult to compute directly, but we can use the Residue Theorem to evaluate it. The Residue Theorem states that the integral of an analytic function around a closed contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function at its poles inside the contour.\n\nThe function g'(z)/g(z) has a simple pole at z = 0, and its residue can be computed as follows:\n\nResidue = lim(z→0) (z * (6z - 2 + 1/z^2) / (3z^2 - 2z + 5 - 1/z))\n\n= lim(z→0) (6z^2 - 2z + 1) / (3z^3 - 2z^2 + 5z - 1)\n\n= 1 / 3\n\nNow, applying the Residue Theorem, we have:\n\n∮(g'(z)/g(z))dz = 2πi * (1/3)\n\nThe change in the argument of f(z) as z traverses the unit circle is equal to the imaginary part of this integral, which is 2π/3.\n\nFinally, we can apply the Argument Principle:\n\nNumber of zeros of f(z) inside |z| = 1 = (2π/3) / 2π = 1/3\n\nSince the number of zeros must be an integer, there is 1 zero of f(z) inside the unit circle |z| = 1."
