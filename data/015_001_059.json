    "message_2": "To find the value of x(t) at t = 10 for the given initial conditions, we need to solve the Lorenz equations numerically. One common method for solving such systems of differential equations is the Runge-Kutta method. Here, we'll use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.\n\nFirst, let's define the Lorenz equations as a function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef lorenz_equations(state, t, sigma, rho, beta):\n    x, y, z = state\n    dx_dt = sigma * (y - x)\n    dy_dt = x * (rho - z) - y\n    dz_dt = x * y - beta * z\n    return np.array([dx_dt, dy_dt, dz_dt])\n```\n\nNow, let's implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n```python\ndef runge_kutta_4th_order(func, state0, t, *args):\n    dt = t[1] - t[0]\n    states = [state0]\n    for _ in t[:-1]:\n        k1 = func(states[-1], _, *args)\n        k2 = func(states[-1] + k1 * dt / 2, _ + dt / 2, *args)\n        k3 = func(states[-1] + k2 * dt / 2, _ + dt / 2, *args)\n        k4 = func(states[-1] + k3 * dt, _ + dt, *args)\n        new_state = states[-1] + (k1 + 2 * k2 + 2 * k3 + k4) * dt / 6\n        states.append(new_state)\n    return np.array(states)\n```\n\nNow we can solve the Lorenz equations using the Runge-Kutta method:\n\n```python\nsigma = 10\nrho = 28\nbeta = 8 / 3\ninitial_state = np.array([1, 1, 1])\nt = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)\n\nsolution = runge_kutta_4th_order(lorenz_equations, initial_state, t, sigma, rho, beta)\n```\n\nFinally, we can find the value of x(t) at t = 10:\n\n```python\nx_t_10 = solution[-1, 0]\nprint(x_t_10)\n```\n\nThis will output the value of x(t) at t = 10 for the given initial conditions. Note that the result may vary slightly depending on the number of steps (1000 in this case) used in the Runge-Kutta method."
