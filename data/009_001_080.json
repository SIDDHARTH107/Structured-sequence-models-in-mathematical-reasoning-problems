    "message_1": "A population of rabbits was introduced to a new island with plenty of food and no predators. The initial population of the rabbits was 20. The rate of growth of the rabbit population is proportional to the number of rabbits present, with the proportionality constant being 0.3. Write down the differential equation which describes the population growth of the rabbits. Using this differential equation, determine the size of the rabbit population after 5 years.",
    "message_2": "The differential equation that describes the population growth of the rabbits can be written as:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population of rabbits, t is time, and k is the proportionality constant (0.3 in this case).\n\ndP/dt = 0.3P\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\ndP/P = 0.3 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫0.3 dt\n\nln(P) = 0.3t + C\n\nTo find the constant C, we can use the initial condition that the population of rabbits is 20 when t = 0:\n\nln(20) = 0.3(0) + C\n\nC = ln(20)\n\nNow we can write the equation for the population of rabbits as a function of time:\n\nln(P) = 0.3t + ln(20)\n\nTo find the size of the rabbit population after 5 years, we can plug in t = 5:\n\nln(P) = 0.3(5) + ln(20)\n\nln(P) = 1.5 + ln(20)\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides to solve for P:\n\nP = e^(1.5 + ln(20))\n\nP ≈ 162.97\n\nAfter 5 years, the size of the rabbit population will be approximately 163 rabbits."
