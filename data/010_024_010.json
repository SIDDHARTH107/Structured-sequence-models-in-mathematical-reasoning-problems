    "message_2": "In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a triangle can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The formula for the area of a hyperbolic triangle with angles α, β, and γ is:\n\nArea = π - (α + β + γ)\n\nGiven the angles of the triangle are 60 degrees, 70 degrees, and 50 degrees, we first need to convert these angles to radians:\n\nα = 60° × (π/180) = π/3 radians\nβ = 70° × (π/180) = 7π/18 radians\nγ = 50° × (π/180) = 5π/18 radians\n\nNow, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the area of the triangle:\n\nArea = π - (π/3 + 7π/18 + 5π/18)\nArea = π - (6π/18 + 7π/18 + 5π/18)\nArea = π - (18π/18)\nArea = π - π\nArea = 0\n\nHowever, this result is not possible in hyperbolic geometry, as the sum of the angles in a hyperbolic triangle must be less than 180 degrees (π radians). The given angles sum to 180 degrees, which is only possible in Euclidean geometry. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement, and the given triangle cannot exist in hyperbolic geometry."
