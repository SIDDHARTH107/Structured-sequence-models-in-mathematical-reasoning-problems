    "message_2": "Let's use combinatorics to solve this problem. We can think of this as choosing pairs of students to work on each project.\n\nThere are C(5, 2) = 10 ways to choose a pair of students for the first project. Once the first project has been assigned, there are 3 students left who haven't been paired for their first project. So, there are C(3, 2) = 3 ways to choose a pair of students for the second project. The remaining student will be paired with one of the students from the first project for their second project.\n\nNow, we have assigned the first two projects, and each student has one project. We need to assign the second project to each student. There are 2 students left from the first project who haven't been paired for their second project. So, there are C(2, 1) = 2 ways to choose a pair of students for the third project. The remaining student from the first project will be paired with one of the students from the second project for their second project.\n\nFinally, we have assigned the first three projects, and each student has two projects. The last project will be assigned to the remaining pair of students from the second project.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to assign the projects is 10 * 3 * 2 = 60 ways."
