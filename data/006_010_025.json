    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people affected by the disease) in n trials (the sample of 100 people)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\"\n- p is the probability of success (a person being affected by the disease), which is 0.2\n- n is the number of trials (100 people)\n- k is the number of successes (35% of 100 people, which is 35 people)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 35) = C(100, 35) * (0.2^35) * (0.8^65)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(100, 35), which is the number of combinations of 100 items taken 35 at a time:\n\nC(100, 35) = 100! / (35! * (100 - 35)!)\nC(100, 35) = 100! / (35! * 65!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 35) = (100! / (35! * 65!)) * (0.2^35) * (0.8^65)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 35) â‰ˆ 0.0363\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 35% of the sample of 100 people will be affected by the disease is approximately 0.0363, or 3.63%."
