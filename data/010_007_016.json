    "message_2": "Let's analyze the space X. We start with the unit disc, which is contractible, and attach a line segment from (0,0) to (1,1). The resulting space is homotopy equivalent to the circle S^1, since we can contract the unit disc to the boundary circle and the attached line segment becomes a diameter of the circle.\n\nNow, let's consider the universal covering space of X, which is homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane. Since the Euclidean plane is simply connected, it has a trivial fundamental group. The covering space theorem states that the fundamental group of the base space (in this case, X) is isomorphic to the group of deck transformations of the covering space.\n\nSince the covering space is homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane, the group of deck transformations is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the circle S^1. The fundamental group of the circle S^1 is known to be isomorphic to the integers Z, generated by a single loop around the circle.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of X is isomorphic to the integers Z."
