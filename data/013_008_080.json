    "message_1": "Suppose there are 10 students in a math class, each assigned a group project. The students can choose to either contribute to the project or shirk their responsibilities. If all 10 students contribute, the project will score a total of 100 points (or 10 points per student). However, if any student chooses to shirk, the score of the project will decrease by 5 points for every shirking student. Each student can receive a 10-point bonus if the project score is above 80 points. What is the best strategy for each student and what is the Nash equilibrium for this scenario?",
    "message_2": "To find the best strategy for each student and the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the payoffs for each student based on their decision to contribute or shirk.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. All 10 students contribute:\n- Project score: 100 points\n- Each student receives: 10 points (base) + 10 points (bonus) = 20 points\n\n2. 1 student shirks, 9 students contribute:\n- Project score: 100 - 5 = 95 points\n- Shirking student receives: 0 points (base) + 10 points (bonus) = 10 points\n- Contributing students receive: (95/9) points (base) + 10 points (bonus) ≈ 20.56 points\n\n3. 2 students shirk, 8 students contribute:\n- Project score: 100 - 10 = 90 points\n- Shirking students receive: 0 points (base) + 10 points (bonus) = 10 points\n- Contributing students receive: (90/8) points (base) + 10 points (bonus) = 21.25 points\n\n4. 3 students shirk, 7 students contribute:\n- Project score: 100 - 15 = 85 points\n- Shirking students receive: 0 points (base) + 10 points (bonus) = 10 points\n- Contributing students receive: (85/7) points (base) + 10 points (bonus) ≈ 22.14 points\n\n5. 4 students shirk, 6 students contribute:\n- Project score: 100 - 20 = 80 points\n- Shirking students receive: 0 points (base) + 0 points (bonus) = 0 points\n- Contributing students receive: (80/6) points (base) + 0 points (bonus) ≈ 13.33 points\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that the best strategy for each student is to contribute to the project as long as there are at least 6 contributors, as this will ensure a project score above 80 points and a bonus for the contributors. If there are less than 6 contributors, the best strategy for a student is to shirk, as the bonus will not be awarded, and they can avoid the work without affecting their own score.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when no student has an incentive to change their strategy, given the strategies of the other students. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when all 10 students contribute to the project. If any student deviates from this strategy and decides to shirk, they will receive a lower score (10 points) compared to contributing (20 points). Therefore, no student has an incentive to change their strategy, and the Nash equilibrium is reached when all students contribute."
