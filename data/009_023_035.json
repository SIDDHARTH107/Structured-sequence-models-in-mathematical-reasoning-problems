    "message_2": "To find the analytical solution for the given Nonlinear Schrödinger equation with the initial condition, we can use the inverse scattering transform method. However, for simplicity, we can also use the known one-soliton solution for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which is given by:\n\n$$\n\\psi(x,t) = \\eta \\frac{\\exp{(i(kx - \\omega t + \\delta))}}{\\cosh{(\\eta(x - x_0 - vt))}}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\eta$ is the amplitude of the soliton, $k$ is the wavenumber, $\\omega$ is the frequency, $\\delta$ is the phase, $x_0$ is the initial position of the soliton, and $v$ is the velocity of the soliton. The relationship between these parameters is given by:\n\n$$\n\\omega = k^2 - \\eta^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v = 2k\n$$\n\nFor the given initial condition, $\\psi(x,0) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh(x)}$, we can identify the parameters as:\n\n$$\n\\eta = 1, \\quad k = 0, \\quad \\delta = 0, \\quad x_0 = 0, \\quad v = 0\n$$\n\nSubstituting these values into the one-soliton solution, we get:\n\n$$\n\\psi(x,t) = \\frac{\\exp{(-it)}}{\\cosh(x)}\n$$\n\nThis is the analytical solution for the given Nonlinear Schrödinger equation with the specified initial condition in the range $-10 \\le x \\le 10$ and $0 \\le t \\le 5$."
