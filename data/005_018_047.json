    "message_1": "Suppose that a group of patients with a certain disease are being treated with a new drug. The survival time for each patient is recorded in days starting from the beginning of their treatment. The following are the survival times (in days) for a sample of 10 patients:\n\n{120, 45, 60, 90, 10, 200, 180, 50, 30, 75}\n\nCalculate the median survival time of patients using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method.",

Calculate the number of patients at risk at each time point.\n3. Calculate the probability of surviving at each time point.\n4. Calculate the cumulative survival probability at each time point.\n5. Find the time point where the cumulative survival probability is closest to 0.5 (50%).\n\nStep 1: Order the survival times in ascending order:\n{10, 30, 45, 50, 60, 75, 90, 120, 180, 200}\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of patients at risk at each time point:\n{10: 10, 30: 9, 45: 8, 50: 7, 60: 6, 75: 5, 90: 4, 120: 3, 180: 2, 200: 1}\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability of surviving at each time point:\nSurvival probability at each time point = (Number of patients at risk - 1) / Number of patients at risk\n{10: 9/10, 30: 8/9, 45: 7/8, 50: 6/7, 60: 5/6, 75: 4/5, 90: 3/4, 120: 2/3, 180: 1/2, 200: 0/1}\n\nStep 4: Calculate the cumulative survival probability at each time point:\n{10: 0.9, 30: 0.9 * 0.89, 45: 0.9 * 0.89 * 0.875, 50: 0.9 * 0.89 * 0.875 * 0.857, 60: 0.9 * 0.89 * 0.875 * 0.857 * 0.833, 75: 0.9 * 0.89 * 0.875 * 0.857 * 0.833 * 0.8, 90: 0.9 * 0.89 * 0.875 * 0.857 * 0.833 * 0.8 * 0.75, 120: 0.9 * 0.89 * 0.875 * 0.857 * 0.833 * 0.8 * 0.75 * 0.667, 180: 0.9 * 0.89 * 0.875 * 0.857 * 0.833 * 0.8 * 0.75 * 0.667 * 0.5, 200: 0}\n\nStep 5: Find the time point where the cumulative survival probability is closest to 0.5 (50%):\nThe closest cumulative survival probability to 0.5 is at the time point 180 days with a cumulative survival probability of 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the median survival time using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method is 180 days."
