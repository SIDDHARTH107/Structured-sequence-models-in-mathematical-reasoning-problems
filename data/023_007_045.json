    "message_2": "To determine the frequency content of the signal represented by F(ω), we need to analyze each term in the Fourier Transform.\n\nF(ω) = 3jωδ(ω) + 2δ(ω-π/2) - jδ(ω+π/2)\n\n1. The first term: 3jωδ(ω)\n\nThis term represents a linear frequency scaling of the impulse function. The frequency content is centered at ω = 0, and the magnitude is proportional to the frequency (ω). Since it's multiplied by j, it has a phase shift of 90 degrees.\n\n2. The second term: 2δ(ω-π/2)\n\nThis term represents an impulse function shifted by π/2. The frequency content is centered at ω = π/2, and the magnitude is 2.\n\n3. The third term: -jδ(ω+π/2)\n\nThis term represents an impulse function shifted by -π/2 and multiplied by -j. The frequency content is centered at ω = -π/2, and the magnitude is 1. Since it's multiplied by -j, it has a phase shift of -90 degrees.\n\nNow, let's sketch the magnitude spectrum:\n\n1. At ω = 0, the magnitude is 0 due to the first term (3jωδ(ω)).\n\n2. At ω = π/2, the magnitude is 2 due to the second term (2δ(ω-π/2)).\n\n3. At ω = -π/2, the magnitude is 1 due to the third term (-jδ(ω+π/2)).\n\nThe magnitude spectrum will have two impulse functions at ω = π/2 and ω = -π/2 with magnitudes 2 and 1, respectively. The linear frequency scaling term (3jωδ(ω)) does not contribute to the magnitude spectrum since it's multiplied by the impulse function at ω = 0."
