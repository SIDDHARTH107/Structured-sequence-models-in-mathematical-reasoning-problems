    "message_2": "The phase shift of a trigonometric function is the horizontal shift of the function along the x-axis. For a cosine function in the form y = A*cos(Bx + C), the phase shift can be found by solving the equation Bx + C = 0 for x.\n\nIn the given function y = 2cos(3x + π/4), we have B = 3 and C = π/4. To find the phase shift, we'll solve the equation 3x + π/4 = 0 for x:\n\n3x + π/4 = 0\n3x = -π/4\nx = (-π/4) / 3\nx = -π/12\n\nThe phase shift of the function y = 2cos(3x + π/4) is -π/12."
