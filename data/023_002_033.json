    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients. The function is an odd function, so we only need to find the sine coefficients (Bn). The Fourier series for an odd function is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑(Bn * sin(nx))\n\nwhere Bn = (2/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nx) dx) from -L to L, and L = π in this case.\n\nNow, let's find Bn:\n\nBn = (2/π) * ∫(x * sin(nx) dx) from -π to 0 + (2/π) * ∫(x * sin(nx) dx) from 0 to π\n\nFor the first integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = dx, v = -cos(nx)/n\n\n∫(x * sin(nx) dx) = -x*cos(nx)/n - ∫(-cos(nx)/n dx) = -x*cos(nx)/n + sin(nx)/n^2\n\nNow, evaluate the integral from -π to 0:\n\n[-(-π*cos(-nπ)/n + sin(-nπ)/n^2) - (-0*cos(0)/n + sin(0)/n^2)] = π/n\n\nFor the second integral, we can use the same integration by parts:\n\n∫(x * sin(nx) dx) = -x*cos(nx)/n + sin(nx)/n^2\n\nNow, evaluate the integral from 0 to π:\n\n[-(π*cos(nπ)/n - sin(nπ)/n^2) - (-0*cos(0)/n + sin(0)/n^2)] = -π/n\n\nNow, let's add both integrals:\n\nBn = (2/π) * (π/n - (-π/n)) = 4/n\n\nSo, the Fourier series for the given function is:\n\nf(x) = ∑((4/n) * sin(nx))\n\nNow, let's determine if the series converges at x = π:\n\nf(π) = ∑((4/n) * sin(nπ))\n\nSince sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n, the series converges to 0 at x = π."
