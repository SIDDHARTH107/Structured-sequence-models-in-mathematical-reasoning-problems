    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we need to consider the divisors of the order of G, which is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. For each divisor d, there exists a unique subgroup of order d, generated by the element a^(12/d).\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1: {e}\nThis subgroup contains only the identity element e. It is trivially cyclic since e is the generator.\n\n2. Subgroup of order 2: {e, a^6}\nThis subgroup is generated by a^6, and since a^6 has order 2 (a^6 * a^6 = a^12 = e), this subgroup is cyclic.\n\n3. Subgroup of order 3: {e, a^4, a^8}\nThis subgroup is generated by a^4, and since a^4 has order 3 (a^4 * a^4 * a^4 = a^12 = e), this subgroup is cyclic.\n\n4. Subgroup of order 4: {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}\nThis subgroup is generated by a^3, and since a^3 has order 4 (a^3 * a^3 * a^3 * a^3 = a^12 = e), this subgroup is cyclic.\n\n5. Subgroup of order 6: {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}\nThis subgroup is generated by a^2, and since a^2 has order 6 (a^2 * a^2 * a^2 * a^2 * a^2 * a^2 = a^12 = e), this subgroup is cyclic.\n\n6. Subgroup of order 12: {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11}\nThis is the entire group G, generated by a, and since G is given to be cyclic, this subgroup is cyclic.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found all the subgroups of G, and each of them is cyclic:\n\n1. {e}\n2. {e, a^6}\n3. {e, a^4, a^8}\n4. {e, a^3, a^6, a^9}\n5. {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8, a^10}\n6. {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9, a^10, a^11}"
