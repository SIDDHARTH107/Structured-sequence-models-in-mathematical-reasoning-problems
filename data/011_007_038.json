    "message_1": "A company has 7 employees including the manager. Each employee can be assigned to either work on marketing or sales. The manager must always be assigned to sales. How many possible assignments are there?",
    "message_2": "Since the manager must always be assigned to sales, we only need to consider the assignments for the remaining 6 employees. Each of these employees can be assigned to either marketing or sales, which means there are 2 choices for each employee.\n\nTo find the total number of possible assignments, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal assignments = 2^number of employees\n\nIn this case, the number of employees to consider is 6 (excluding the manager).\n\nTotal assignments = 2^6 = 64\n\nSo there are 64 possible assignments for the employees, considering the manager is always assigned to sales."
