    "message_2": "The graph has 6 vertices (V = {A, B, C, D, E, F}) and 7 edges (E = {AB, AC, CD, DE, EF, FA, BD}). \n\nTo determine if the graph is planar or non-planar, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nHowever, we don't have the number of faces (F) yet. We can use another property of planar graphs to help us:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nE = 7\nV = 6\n\nPlugging the values into the inequality:\n\n7 ≤ 3(6) - 6\n7 ≤ 18 - 6\n7 ≤ 12\n\nThe inequality holds true, so it is possible that the graph is planar. However, this is not a definitive test, so we should try to draw the graph to see if it can be drawn without any edge crossings.\n\nUpon drawing the graph, we can see that it can be drawn without any edge crossings, which confirms that the graph is indeed planar."
