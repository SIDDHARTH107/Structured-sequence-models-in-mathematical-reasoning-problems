    "message_2": "In a standard deck of 52 cards, there is only 1 King of Hearts. To find the probability of drawing the King of Hearts on the first draw, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (drawing the King of Hearts), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (since there are 52 cards in the deck).\n\nSo, the probability of drawing the King of Hearts on the first draw is:\n\nProbability = 1/52 â‰ˆ 0.01923 or 1.923%"
