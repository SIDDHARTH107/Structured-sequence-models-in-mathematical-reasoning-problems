Since we don't have a universal set defined, we can consider the union of A and B as the universal set for this problem. \n\nU = A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10}\n\nA' = U - A = {6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the sets in the given expressions:\n\n1. (A △ B) ∩ A' = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10} ∩ {6, 8, 10} = {6, 8, 10}\n\n2. (A ∩ A') △ (B ∩ A') = (∅) △ ({6, 8, 10}) = {6, 8, 10}\n\nSince (A △ B) ∩ A' = {6, 8, 10} and (A ∩ A') △ (B ∩ A') = {6, 8, 10}, the two sets are equal.
