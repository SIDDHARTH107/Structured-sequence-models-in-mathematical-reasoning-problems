    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern that is formed by dividing a square into 9 smaller squares and removing the middle square, then repeating the process for each of the remaining squares.\n\nLet's denote the length of the perimeter of the original square as P0, which is given as 4 units. In the first iteration, the square is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the middle square is removed, leaving 8 smaller squares. The side length of each smaller square is 1/3 of the original square's side length.\n\nIn the first iteration, the perimeter P1 can be calculated as follows:\n\nP1 = 8 * (1/3) * P0\n\nFor each subsequent iteration, the perimeter Pi can be calculated as:\n\nPi = 8 * (1/3) * Pi-1\n\nNow, we need to find the perimeter of the 6th iteration (P6). We can do this by applying the formula iteratively:\n\nP1 = 8 * (1/3) * P0 = 8 * (1/3) * 4 = 32/3\nP2 = 8 * (1/3) * P1 = 8 * (1/3) * (32/3) = 1024/27\nP3 = 8 * (1/3) * P2 = 8 * (1/3) * (1024/27) = 32768/243\nP4 = 8 * (1/3) * P3 = 8 * (1/3) * (32768/243) = 1048576/2187\nP5 = 8 * (1/3) * P4 = 8 * (1/3) * (1048576/2187) = 33554432/19683\nP6 = 8 * (1/3) * P5 = 8 * (1/3) * (33554432/19683) = 1073741824/59049\n\nSo, the length of the perimeter of the 6th iteration of the Vicsek fractal is 1073741824/59049 units."
