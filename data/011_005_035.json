    "message_2": "To choose a committee of 3 students out of a class of 15 students, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (15 in this case), k is the number of students to choose (3 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3!(15-3)!)\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3!12!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the factorials:\n\n15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1\n12! = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n\nNow, let's plug these factorials back into the combination formula:\n\nC(15, 3) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling out the common factors (12!):\n\nC(15, 3) = (15 × 14 × 13) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n\nNow, let's calculate the result:\n\nC(15, 3) = (15 × 14 × 13) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 2730 / 6 = 455\n\nSo, there are 455 ways to choose a committee of 3 students out of a class of 15 students."
