    "message_2": "To find the area between the two curves, we first need to find the points of intersection. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 2x - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 2x\n\nx^2 = x\n\nx(x - 1) = 0\n\nx = 0 or x = 1\n\nNow, we will integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval [-1, 2]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - x^2 - x^2) dx from -1 to 2\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 2x^2) dx from -1 to 2\n\nNow, we'll find the antiderivative:\n\nF(x) = x^2 - (2/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the antiderivative at the limits of integration:\n\nF(2) = (2)^2 - (2/3)(2)^3 + C = 4 - (16/3) + C\nF(-1) = (-1)^2 - (2/3)(-1)^3 + C = 1 + (2/3) + C\n\nNow, we'll subtract F(-1) from F(2):\n\nArea = F(2) - F(-1) = (4 - 16/3) - (1 + 2/3)\n\nArea = (4 - 1) - (16/3 - 2/3) = 3 - 14/3 = (9 - 14)/3 = -5/3\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nArea = |-5/3| = 5/3\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - x^2 within the limits of x = -1 and x = 2 is 5/3 square units."
