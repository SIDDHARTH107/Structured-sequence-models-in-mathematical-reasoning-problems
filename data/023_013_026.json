Use Fourier transform to solve.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state temperature distribution in the one-dimensional rod, we need to solve the heat equation with the given boundary and initial conditions. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T(x,t) / ∂t = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity of the rod material. Since we are interested in the steady-state solution, we set ∂T(x,t) / ∂t = 0:\n\n0 = α ∂²T(x,t) / ∂x²\n\nNow, we can use the Fourier transform to solve this equation. Let's define the Fourier transform of T(x,t) as:\n\nT(k,t) = ∫[T(x,t) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nApplying the Fourier transform to the heat equation, we get:\n\n0 = α ∂²T(k,t) / ∂x²\n\nNow, we can solve this equation for T(k,t):\n\nT(k,t) = C(k) * e^(-αk²t)\n\nwhere C(k) is the Fourier transform of the initial temperature distribution T(x,0):\n\nC(k) = ∫[T(x,0) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nNow, we can find the inverse Fourier transform of T(k,t) to get the steady-state temperature distribution T(x,t):\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) ∫[T(k,t) * e^(ikx)] dk\n\nSince we are interested in the steady-state solution, we can take the limit as t → ∞:\n\nT(x,∞) = (1/2π) ∫[C(k) * e^(-αk²∞) * e^(ikx)] dk\n\nAs t → ∞, the exponential term e^(-αk²∞) goes to zero, and we are left with:\n\nT(x,∞) = (1/2π) ∫[C(k) * e^(ikx)] dk\n\nNow, we need to find C(k) by taking the Fourier transform of the initial temperature distribution T(x,0):\n\nC(k) = ∫[(50 + 25cos(3πx/L) + 10sin(6πx/L)) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nSince the initial temperature distribution is given in terms of cosines and sines, it is more convenient to use the Fourier cosine and sine transforms instead of the complex exponential Fourier transform. The Fourier cosine and sine transforms are given by:\n\nC(k) = ∫[T(x,0) * cos(kx)] dx\nS(k) = ∫[T(x,0) * sin(kx)] dx\n\nApplying the Fourier cosine and sine transforms to the initial temperature distribution, we get:\n\nC(k) = 50δ(k) + 25δ(k - 3π/L) + 0\nS(k) = 0 + 0 + 10δ(k - 6π/L)\n\nwhere δ(k) is the Dirac delta function. Now, we can find the inverse Fourier cosine and sine transforms of C(k) and S(k) to get the steady-state temperature distribution T(x,∞):\n\nT(x,∞) = 50 + 25cos(3πx/L) + 10sin(6πx/L)\n\nSo, the steady-state temperature distribution in the one-dimensional rod is:\n\nT(x,∞) = 50 + 25cos(3πx/10) + 10sin(6πx/10)"
