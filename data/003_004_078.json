    "message_2": "To find the value of theta (in degrees) for the equation cos(theta) = 0.5, we need to find the angle whose cosine is 0.5.\n\nThe cosine function has a value of 0.5 at two angles in the range of 0 to 360 degrees:\n\n1. Theta = 60 degrees (This is because cos(60°) = 0.5)\n2. Theta = 300 degrees (This is because cos(300°) = 0.5)\n\nSo, the two possible values of theta (in degrees) for the equation cos(theta) = 0.5 are 60 degrees and 300 degrees."
