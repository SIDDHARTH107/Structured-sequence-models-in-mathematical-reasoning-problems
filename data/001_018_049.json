    "message_2": "To simplify the logarithmic expression log(base 10) 8 + log(base 10) 6, we can use the logarithmic property that states:\n\nlog(a) + log(b) = log(a * b)\n\nApplying this property to the given expression, we get:\n\nlog(base 10) 8 + log(base 10) 6 = log(base 10) (8 * 6)\n\nNow, multiply 8 and 6:\n\n8 * 6 = 48\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\nlog(base 10) 48"
