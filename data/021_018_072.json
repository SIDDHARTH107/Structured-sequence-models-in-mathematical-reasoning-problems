    "message_2": "Tabu search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is typically used for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, since you requested to use tabu search for this continuous optimization problem, I will provide a general outline of the algorithm and then apply it to the given problem.\n\n1. Initialize the starting solution (x0, y0) randomly within the feasible region.\n2. Define a neighborhood function to generate neighboring solutions.\n3. Set the tabu list size and other algorithm parameters.\n4. Perform the search iteratively, updating the best solution and the tabu list.\n\nFor this problem, we can define the neighborhood function as generating random points within a certain distance from the current point. The tabu list will store recently visited solutions to avoid cycling.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the tabu search algorithm for this problem:\n\n1. Initialize the starting solution (x0, y0) randomly within the feasible region, e.g., (2, 4).\n2. Define the neighborhood function as generating random points within a distance of 1 from the current point.\n3. Set the tabu list size to 10 and the maximum number of iterations to 100.\n4. Perform the search iteratively, updating the best solution and the tabu list.\n\nAfter running the tabu search algorithm, suppose we find the optimal solution to be (x, y) = (3.5, 3.25). The objective function value at this optimal solution is:\n\nf(3.5, 3.25) = (3.5)^2 + 4(3.25)^2 - (3.5)(3.25) - 7(3.5) - 11(3.25) ≈ -26.4375\n\nPlease note that the tabu search algorithm is a heuristic method, and the solution found may not be the global optimum. For this specific problem, other optimization methods like gradient descent or the simplex method may be more suitable for finding the exact optimal solution."
