    "message_2": "Let's first find the intersection number of $C$ with a line $L$ that passes through two arbitrary points on the sphere.\n\nConsider a plane that contains the circle $C$. This plane intersects the sphere $S$ in a circle of radius 3. Now, let $L$ be a line that passes through two arbitrary points on the sphere. This line will intersect the plane in a single point. Since the circle $C$ is contained in the plane, the line $L$ will intersect the circle $C$ in either 0, 1, or 2 points.\n\nIn the generic case, the line $L$ will intersect the circle $C$ in 2 points. However, if the line $L$ is tangent to the circle $C$, it will intersect the circle in exactly 1 point. If the line $L$ does not intersect the plane containing the circle $C$, it will not intersect the circle at all (0 points). Therefore, the intersection number of $C$ with a line $L$ that passes through two arbitrary points on the sphere is 2 in the generic case.\n\nNow, let's calculate the degree of the line $L$. The degree of a line on the sphere is the number of times it intersects the equator (a great circle) of the sphere. Since $L$ passes through two arbitrary points on the sphere, it will intersect the equator in 2 points. Therefore, the degree of the line $L$ is 2.\n\nTo verify our answer using Poincaré duality, we need to show that the intersection number of $C$ and $L$ is equal to the product of their degrees. The degree of the circle $C$ is 1, as it is a simple closed curve on the sphere. The degree of the line $L$ is 2, as we calculated earlier. The product of their degrees is 1 * 2 = 2, which is equal to the intersection number of $C$ and $L$ that we found earlier. Therefore, our answer is consistent with Poincaré duality."
