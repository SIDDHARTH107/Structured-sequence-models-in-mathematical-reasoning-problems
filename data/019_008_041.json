You want to create a fuzzy logic system to determine the rental price based on the car model and the customer's age. You have the following membership functions for age groups:\n\n- Young: triangular function with a base from 18 to 25, center at 20\n- Middle-aged: triangular function with a base from 25 to 45, center at 35\n- Old: triangular function with a base from 45 to 60, center at 50\n\nYou also have the following membership functions for car models:\n\n- Compact: triangular function with a base from 0 to 30, center at 15\n- Mid-size: triangular function with a base from 10 to 50, center at 30\n- SUV: triangular function with a base from 30 to 70, center at 50\n- Luxury: triangular function with a base from 40 to 100, center at 70\n\nIf a customer who is 30 years old wants to rent a mid-size car, and the rental price for a mid-size car is determined by the following rules:\n\n- If the customer is young, the rental price will be 70 dollars plus 2 dollars for every percentage point above 20 on the mid-size membership function.\n- If the customer is middle-aged, the rental price will be 80 dollars plus 1.5 dollars for every percentage point above 30 on the mid-size membership function.\n- If the customer is old, the rental price will be 90 dollars plus 1 dollar for every percentage point above 30 on the mid-size membership function.\n\nWhat will be the rental price for this customer?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to determine the membership values for the customer's age in each age group.\n\nFor the young age group, since the customer is 30 years old and the young age group has a base from 18 to 25, the membership value is 0.\n\nFor the middle-aged age group, the triangular function has a base from 25 to 45 and a center at 35. The customer's age is 30, so we can calculate the membership value using the triangular function formula:\n\nMembership value = (x - a) / (b - a)\nwhere x is the customer's age, a is the lower limit of the base, and b is the center.\n\nMembership value = (30 - 25) / (35 - 25) = 5 / 10 = 0.5\n\nFor the old age group, since the customer is 30 years old and the old age group has a base from 45 to 60, the membership value is 0.\n\nNext, we need to determine the membership value for the mid-size car model. The triangular function for the mid-size car model has a base from 10 to 50 and a center at 30. Since the customer wants to rent a mid-size car, the membership value is 1.\n\nNow, we can calculate the rental price for each rule:\n\n1. If the customer is young, the rental price will be 70 dollars plus 2 dollars for every percentage point above 20 on the mid-size membership function. Since the young membership value is 0, this rule does not apply.\n\n2. If the customer is middle-aged, the rental price will be 80 dollars plus 1.5 dollars for every percentage point above 30 on the mid-size membership function. The middle-aged membership value is 0.5, and the mid-size membership value is 1.\n\nRental price = 80 + 1.5 * (1 - 0.5) * 100 = 80 + 1.5 * 50 = 80 + 75 = 155 dollars\n\n3. If the customer is old, the rental price will be 90 dollars plus 1 dollar for every percentage point above 30 on the mid-size membership function. Since the old membership value is 0, this rule does not apply.\n\nTherefore, the rental price for this customer will be 155 dollars."
