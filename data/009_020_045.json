The energy cost function in terms of input control u(t) (measured in kW) is given as: \n\nJ = ∫(u^2(t) + 2u(t))dt from t = 0 to t = 4\n\nHowever, the power output y(t) of the manufacturing process follows the differential equation:\n\ny''(t) + 2y'(t) + y(t) = 4u(t)\n\nwhere y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 0.\n\nDetermine the optimal control input u(t) such that the energy cost is minimized over the time interval 0 to 4, subject to the manufacturing process constraints.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, which states that the optimal control input u(t) minimizes the Hamiltonian function H, given by:\n\nH = u^2(t) + 2u(t) + λ(t)(4u(t) - y''(t) - 2y'(t) - y(t))\n\nwhere λ(t) is the costate variable, and the costate equation is:\n\nλ'(t) = -∂H/∂y = y(t) + 2y'(t) + y''(t)\n\nwith the transversality condition λ(4) = 0.\n\nFirst, we need to find the optimal control u(t) that minimizes the Hamiltonian. To do this, we take the derivative of H with respect to u(t) and set it equal to zero:\n\n∂H/∂u = 2u(t) + 2 + 4λ(t) = 0\n\nSolving for u(t), we get:\n\nu(t) = -1 - 2λ(t)\n\nNow, we need to find the costate variable λ(t). We can substitute the optimal control u(t) into the costate equation:\n\nλ'(t) = y(t) + 2y'(t) + y''(t) = 4(-1 - 2λ(t)) - y''(t) - 2y'(t) - y(t)\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\ny''(t) + 2y'(t) + y(t) + 4λ'(t) = -4\n\nSince y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 0, we can solve this fourth-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients using the Laplace transform or other methods. The solution is:\n\ny(t) = -2t + 2(1 - e^(-t))\ny'(t) = -2 + 2e^(-t)\ny''(t) = -2e^(-t)\n\nNow, we can substitute y(t), y'(t), and y''(t) into the costate equation:\n\nλ'(t) = -2t + 2(1 - e^(-t)) - 4 + 4e^(-t) - 2e^(-t) = -2t\n\nIntegrating λ'(t) with respect to t, we get:\n\nλ(t) = -t^2/2 + C\n\nApplying the transversality condition λ(4) = 0, we find:\n\n0 = -16/2 + C\nC = 8\n\nSo, λ(t) = -t^2/2 + 8.\n\nNow, we can substitute λ(t) back into the optimal control equation:\n\nu(t) = -1 - 2(-t^2/2 + 8) = -1 + t^2 - 16\n\nThus, the optimal control input u(t) that minimizes the energy cost is:\n\nu(t) = t^2 - 17"
