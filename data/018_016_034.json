    "message_2": "(i) (X × Y) ∪ (Y × X)\n\nFirst, let's find the Cartesian product of X × Y and Y × X:\n\nX × Y = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\nY × X = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n(X × Y) ∪ (Y × X) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n(ii) (Y × X) ∪ (X × Y)\n\nWe already found the Cartesian product of Y × X and X × Y, so let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n(Y × X) ∪ (X × Y) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's compare (i) and (ii):\n\n(i) (X × Y) ∪ (Y × X) = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n(ii) (Y × X) ∪ (X × Y) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that both (i) and (ii) contain the same elements, just listed in a different order. Since the order of elements in a set does not matter, we can conclude that (i) and (ii) are equal:\n\n(i) (X × Y) ∪ (Y × X) = (Y × X) ∪ (X × Y)\n\nThis means that the Cartesian product of two sets is commutative with respect to union, which contradicts the statement given in the problem. The problem statement is incorrect."
