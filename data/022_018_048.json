    "message_2": "To check if the function $f(z) = x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy$ is analytic at $z = 1+i$, we need to verify if it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations at that point. Let $u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2$ and $v(x, y) = 2xy$. Then, $f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)$.\n\nThe Cauchy-Riemann equations are given by:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -2y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = 2y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 2x$\n\nNow, let's check if the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied at $z = 1+i$:\n\n1. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\Rightarrow 2(1) = 2(1)$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\Rightarrow -2(1) = -2(1)$\n\nBoth equations are satisfied at $z = 1+i$, so the function $f(z) = x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy$ is analytic at $z = 1+i$."
