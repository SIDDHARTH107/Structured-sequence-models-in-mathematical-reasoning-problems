    "message_2": "To find the value of dy/dx, we will first differentiate the given equation implicitly with respect to x.\n\nGiven equation: y^2 + xy = 16\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\nd(y^2)/dx + d(xy)/dx = d(16)/dx\n\nUsing the chain rule for the first term and the product rule for the second term:\n\n2y(dy/dx) + (x(dy/dx) + y) = 0\n\nNow, we need to solve for dy/dx when y = 2. \n\n2(2)(dy/dx) + (x(dy/dx) + 2) = 0\n\n4(dy/dx) + x(dy/dx) + 2 = 0\n\nTo find the value of x when y = 2, we can substitute y = 2 back into the original equation:\n\n(2)^2 + 2x = 16\n\n4 + 2x = 16\n\n2x = 12\n\nx = 6\n\nNow, substitute x = 6 and y = 2 into the differentiated equation:\n\n4(dy/dx) + 6(dy/dx) + 2 = 0\n\n10(dy/dx) = -2\n\ndy/dx = -2/10\n\ndy/dx = -1/5\n\nSo, the value of dy/dx when y = 2 is -1/5."
