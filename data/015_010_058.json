    "message_2": "1) To find the Poincaré map for this system, we will plot x_(n+1) vs. x_n for a range of initial values x_0. We can do this by iterating the given equation for different values of x_0 and r.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to generate the Poincaré map:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef chaotic_system(x_n, r):\n    return x_n + r * np.sin(2 * np.pi * x_n)\n\nx_0_values = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)\nr = 0.8\n\nx_n_values = x_0_values\nx_n_plus_1_values = chaotic_system(x_n_values, r)\n\nplt.plot(x_n_values, x_n_plus_1_values, '.')\nplt.xlabel('x_n')\nplt.ylabel('x_(n+1)')\nplt.title('Poincaré map for r = 0.8')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n2) To determine the period of the system for r = 0.8, we can analyze the Poincaré map. The period is the number of iterations it takes for the system to return to a similar state. By observing the plot, we can see that the system has a period of 1, as the points lie close to the line x_(n+1) = x_n.\n\n3) To determine the critical value of r at which the system transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior, we can analyze the bifurcation diagram. A bifurcation diagram is a plot of the stable points of the system as a function of the parameter r. As r increases, the system will transition from periodic to chaotic behavior at a critical value of r.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to generate the bifurcation diagram:\n\n```python\ndef bifurcation_diagram(r_values, x_0, num_iterations, num_transient):\n    x_n_values = []\n    r_plot_values = []\n    \n    for r in r_values:\n        x_n = x_0\n        for i in range(num_iterations + num_transient):\n            x_n = chaotic_system(x_n, r)\n            if i >= num_transient:\n                x_n_values.append(x_n)\n                r_plot_values.append(r)\n                \n    return r_plot_values, x_n_values\n\nr_values = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)\nx_0 = 0.5\nnum_iterations = 100\nnum_transient = 100\n\nr_plot_values, x_n_values = bifurcation_diagram(r_values, x_0, num_iterations, num_transient)\n\nplt.plot(r_plot_values, x_n_values, ',')\nplt.xlabel('r')\nplt.ylabel('x_n')\nplt.title('Bifurcation diagram')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy observing the bifurcation diagram, we can estimate the critical value of r at which the system transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior. In this case, the critical value of r appears to be around 0.6."
