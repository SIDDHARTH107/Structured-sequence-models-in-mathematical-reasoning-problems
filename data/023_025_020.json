The magnitude of the Fourier transform is plotted against the frequency in Hz.\n\n3. The frequency at which the magnitude is maximum will be displayed in the command window (e.g., \"The maximum magnitude occurs at XX.XX Hz\").\n\n4. The two frequencies at which the magnitude drops to half of its maximum value will be displayed in the command window (e.g., \"The magnitude drops to half of its maximum value at XX.XX Hz and YY.YY Hz\").\n\n5. The area under the curve of the magnitude of the Fourier transform will be displayed in the command window (e.g., \"The area under the curve of the magnitude of the Fourier transform is ZZ.ZZ\")."
