    "message_2": "First, let's find A × B:\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find (A × B) △ B:\nTo find the symmetric difference, we need to find the elements that are in either (A × B) or B, but not in both. Since B contains single elements and (A × B) contains ordered pairs, there are no common elements. Therefore, (A × B) △ B is just the union of both sets:\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), 2, 3}\n\nNext, let's find A △ B:\nA △ B = {1, 3} (1 is in A but not in B, and 3 is in B but not in A)\n\nNow, let's find (A △ B) × B:\n(A △ B) × B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nComparing the two results, we can see that (A × B) △ B ≠ (A △ B) × B:\n{(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), 2, 3} ≠ {(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product is not associative with respect to symmetric difference for these sets A and B."
