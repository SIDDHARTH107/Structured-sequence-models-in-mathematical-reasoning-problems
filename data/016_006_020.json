    "message_2": "The scaling ratio in the Barnsley fern algorithm can be determined by dividing the length of the longest frond by the length of the stem. In this case, the longest frond is 2.7 units long, and the stem is 1 unit long.\n\nScaling ratio = (Length of the longest frond) / (Length of the stem)\nScaling ratio = 2.7 / 1\nScaling ratio = 2.7\n\nSo, the scaling ratio used in the Barnsley fern algorithm for this scenario is 2.7."
