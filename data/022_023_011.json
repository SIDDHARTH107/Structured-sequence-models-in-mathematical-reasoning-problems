    "message_2": "To solve the wave equation using the complex variable method, we first express the solution as a sum of complex exponentials:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2}(f(x-ct) + g(x+ct))$$\n\nwhere $f$ and $g$ are complex functions. We can rewrite this as:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2}(f(z) + g(z^*))$$\n\nwhere $z = x - ct + i(x + ct)$ and $z^* = x - ct - i(x + ct)$ are complex variables.\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions:\n\n1) $u(x,0) = \\sin(ax)$:\n\n$$\\sin(ax) = \\frac{1}{2}(f(x+ix) + g(x-ix))$$\n\n2) $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$:\n\n$$0 = \\frac{1}{2}(-cf'(x+ix) + cg'(x-ix))$$\n\nFrom the first initial condition, we can express $f$ and $g$ in terms of the sine function:\n\n$$f(z) = 2\\sin(ax) - g(z^*)$$\n\nSubstituting this expression into the second initial condition, we get:\n\n$$0 = -c(2\\sin(ax) - g'(z^*)) + cg'(z^*)$$\n\nSolving for $g'(z^*)$, we find:\n\n$$g'(z^*) = 2c\\sin(ax)$$\n\nIntegrating with respect to $z^*$, we obtain:\n\n$$g(z^*) = -2c\\int\\sin(ax)dz^* = -\\frac{2c}{a}\\cos(ax) + C$$\n\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. Now, we can find $f(z)$:\n\n$$f(z) = 2\\sin(ax) - g(z^*) = 2\\sin(ax) + \\frac{2c}{a}\\cos(ax) - C$$\n\nFinally, we can express the solution $u(x,t)$ in terms of the original variables:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2}(f(x-ct+ix+ct) + g(x-ct-ix+ct))$$\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\sin(ax) + \\frac{2c}{a}\\cos(ax) - C + 2\\sin(ax) - \\frac{2c}{a}\\cos(ax) + C)$$\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sin(ax)$$\n\nNow, we want to find the time it takes for the wave to travel a distance of $2\\pi/a$ units to the right, starting from the position $x=0$. Since the wave speed is $c$, the time it takes to travel this distance is:\n\n$$t = \\frac{2\\pi/a}{c} = \\frac{2\\pi}{ac}$$"
