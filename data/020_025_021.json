The distance between each store is given in the table below:\n\n| Store |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |   E   |\n|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| A     |   0   |   9   |   7   |  12   |   6   |\n| B     |   9   |   0   |   8   |  10   |  11  |\n| C     |   7   |   8   |   0   |   6   |   5   |\n| D     |  12  |  10  |   6   |   0   |   7   |\n| E     |   6   |  11  |   5   |   7   |   0   |\n\nThe truck has to start and end at Store A.

(4 factorial) possible routes since the truck has to start and end at Store A. The 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 possible routes are:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → E → A\n2. A → B → C → E → D → A\n3.

The truck can choose either of these routes to minimize the total distance traveled."
