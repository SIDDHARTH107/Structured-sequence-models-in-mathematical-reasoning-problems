    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms producing identical products in a market with a total demand of 100 units. The firms simultaneously set their prices, and consumers will buy from the firm with the lower price. The firms have the same production cost of $20 per unit. What prices will each firm set in the Bertrand competition? What will be the total profit of each firm?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete by setting prices, and consumers will buy from the firm with the lower price. If both firms set the same price, they will split the market demand equally. Since both firms have the same production cost of $20 per unit, they will try to undercut each other's prices to capture the entire market demand of 100 units.\n\nLet's consider the following scenarios:\n\n1. If one firm sets a price slightly above $20, say $20.01, the other firm can set a price slightly below $20.01, say $20, to capture the entire market. However, this would mean that the second firm is selling at a price equal to its production cost, making no profit.\n\n2. If both firms set a price equal to their production cost, $20, they will split the market demand equally, selling 50 units each. However, they will make no profit as their price equals their production cost.\n\n3. If both firms set a price slightly above their production cost, say $20.01, they will split the market demand equally, selling 50 units each. In this case, they will make a small profit of $0.01 per unit, resulting in a total profit of $0.50 for each firm.\n\nIn a Bertrand competition, firms will continue to undercut each other's prices until they reach their production cost. In this case, the equilibrium price will be $20, and both firms will set this price. Since they are selling at their production cost, their total profit will be zero."
