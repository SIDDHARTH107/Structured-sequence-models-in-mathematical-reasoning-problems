    "message_2": "If G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30, then G has a unique subgroup of order 5. This is because a cyclic group of order n has exactly one subgroup of order d for each divisor d of n. In this case, the divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. So, there is only one subgroup of order 5 in C30.\n\nIf G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15, then G has two distinct subgroups of order 5. The dihedral group D15 has order 2 * 15 = 30 and consists of the symmetries of a regular 15-gon, including rotations and reflections. The rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order 15, which has a unique subgroup of order 5. Additionally, there is another subgroup of order 5 consisting of a reflection and the rotations that are multiples of 3. These two subgroups of order 5 are distinct in D15.\n\nIn either case, G has at most two distinct subgroups of order 5. Therefore, G has exactly two distinct subgroups of order 5 when it is isomorphic to the dihedral group D15 and only one when it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C30."
