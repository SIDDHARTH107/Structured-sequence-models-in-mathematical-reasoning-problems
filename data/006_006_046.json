    "message_1": "In a basketball game, a player has a 70% free throw shooting percentage. If the player takes 8 shots from the free throw line, what is the probability that the player makes all 8 shots?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the player making all 8 shots, we need to multiply the probability of making each shot together. Since the player has a 70% free throw shooting percentage, the probability of making each shot is 0.7.\n\nSo, the probability of making all 8 shots is:\n\n0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.7^8 â‰ˆ 0.0578\n\nTherefore, the probability of the player making all 8 shots is approximately 5.78%."
