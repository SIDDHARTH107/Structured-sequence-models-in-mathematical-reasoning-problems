    "message_1": "Here is a numerical problem for a math student to solve in the subtopic of Solving optimization problems using harmony search:\n\nA factory produces two types of products: A and B. The manufacturing process requires two resources: Resource X and Resource Y. The cost of production for product A is $4 per unit, and for product B, it is $6 per unit. Resource X is limited to 200 units, while resource Y is limited to 250 units. Product A requires 2 units of Resource X and 1 unit of Resource Y to manufacture, while product B requires 3 units of Resource X and 2 units of Resource Y to manufacture. Determine the optimal number of products A and B that the factory can produce to maximize profit, given that the selling price for product A is $8 per unit, and for product B, it is $10 per unit, using the harmony search optimization technique.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the harmony search optimization technique, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function\n2. Set harmony memory size, harmony memory considering rate, and pitch adjusting rate\n3. Initialize harmony memory\n4. Improvise a new harmony\n5. Update harmony memory\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until stopping criteria are met\n\nStep 1: Define the objective function\nThe objective function is to maximize the profit. Let x be the number of product A and y be the number of product B. The profit function is:\n\nP(x, y) = (8 - 4)x + (10 - 6)y = 4x + 4y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 3y <= 200 (Resource X constraint)\nx + 2y <= 250 (Resource Y constraint)\nx, y >= 0\n\nStep 2: Set harmony memory size (HMS), harmony memory considering rate (HMCR), and pitch adjusting rate (PAR)\nLet HMS = 10, HMCR = 0.8, and PAR = 0.3.\n\nStep 3: Initialize harmony memory\nGenerate 10 random solutions (x, y) within the constraints and calculate their profits. Store these solutions in the harmony memory.\n\nStep 4: Improvise a new harmony\nFor each decision variable (x and y), generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the random number is less than HMCR, select a value from the harmony memory. If the random number is greater than HMCR, generate a new random value within the constraints. If the random number is less than PAR, adjust the value slightly.\n\nStep 5: Update harmony memory\nCalculate the profit of the new harmony. If the new harmony's profit is better than the worst harmony in the harmony memory, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n\nStep 6: Repeat steps 4 and 5 until stopping criteria are met\nContinue iterating steps 4 and 5 for a predetermined number of iterations or until the solution converges.\n\nAfter performing the harmony search optimization, we will obtain the optimal number of products A and B that the factory can produce to maximize profit. The solution will be an integer value for both x and y, considering the constraints and maximizing the profit function P(x, y) = 4x + 4y."
