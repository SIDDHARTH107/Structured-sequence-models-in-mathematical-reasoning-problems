    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate x from the second and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 2, then subtract the second equation from the first.\n\n(5)(2x - 3y + 4z) = (5)(12)\n(2)(x + 2y - 2z) = (2)(2)\n\n10x - 15y + 20z = 60\n2x + 4y - 4z = 4\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(10x - 15y + 20z) - (2x + 4y - 4z) = 60 - 4\n8x - 19y + 24z = 56\n\nNow, we will eliminate x from the first and third equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by -5 and add it to the third equation.\n\n(-5)(2x - 3y + 4z) = (-5)(12)\n5x - 7y + 6z = 27\n\n-10x + 15y - 20z = -60\n5x - 7y + 6z = 27\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n-5y - 14z = -33\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables:\n\n8x - 19y + 24z = 56\n-5y - 14z = -33\n\nWe will now eliminate y from these two equations. To do this, we will multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 19, then add the two equations:\n\n(5)(8x - 19y + 24z) = (5)(56)\n(19)(-5y - 14z) = (19)(-33)\n\n40x - 95y + 120z = 280\n-95y - 266z = -627\n\nNow, add the two equations:\n\n40x - 386z = -347\n\nNow, we have an equation with one variable:\n\n40x - 386z = -347\n\nWe can solve for x:\n\n40x = 386z - 347\nx = (386z - 347) / 40\n\nNow, we will substitute this value of x back into the second equation:\n\n-5y - 14z = -33\n\n-5y = 14z - 33\ny = (14z - 33) / -5\n\nNow, we will substitute the values of x and y back into the first equation:\n\n2x - 3y + 4z = 12\n\n2((386z - 347) / 40) - 3((14z - 33) / -5) + 4z = 12\n\n(386z - 347) / 20 + (42z - 99) / 5 + 4z = 12\n\nNow, we will find a common denominator and add the fractions:\n\n(193z - 173.5) / 10 + (42z - 99) / 5 + 4z = 12\n\n(193z - 173.5 + 84z - 198) / 10 + 4z = 12\n\n(277z - 371.5) / 10 + 4z = 12\n\nNow, we will multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n277z - 371.5 + 40z = 120\n\n317z = 491.5\n\nNow, we will divide both sides by 317:\n\nz = 491.5 / 317\nz ≈ 1.55\n\nNow, we will substitute this value of z back into the expressions for x and y:\n\nx = (386(1.55) - 347) / 40\nx ≈ 1.99\n\ny = (14(1.55) - 33) / -5\ny ≈ 0.61\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately:\n\nx ≈ 1.99\ny ≈ 0.61\nz ≈ 1.55"
