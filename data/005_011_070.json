    "message_1": "A scientist wants to conduct an experiment to test the effectiveness of a new fertilizer. He has three different types of soil (loamy, sandy, and clayey) and he plans to use two different amounts of fertilizer (50 grams and 100 grams) on each type of soil. How many experimental units does the scientist need to create to conduct the experiment?",
    "message_2": "The scientist has 3 types of soil and 2 amounts of fertilizer. To find the total number of experimental units, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal experimental units = (Number of soil types) × (Number of fertilizer amounts)\n\nTotal experimental units = 3 × 2 = 6\n\nSo, the scientist needs to create 6 experimental units to conduct the experiment."
