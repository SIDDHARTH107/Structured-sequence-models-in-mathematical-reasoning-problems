    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 48 = 2^4 * 3^1\n2. Determine the number of possible abelian groups using the partition of the exponents of the prime factors. For 48, there are 5 possible abelian groups: Z_48, Z_24 x Z_2, Z_16 x Z_3, Z_12 x Z_4, and Z_8 x Z_6.\n3. Determine the number of non-abelian groups using the formula for the number of groups of order p^aq^b: gcd(a, q-1) + 1. In this case, we have p = 2, a = 4, q = 3, and b = 1. So, gcd(4, 3-1) + 1 = gcd(4, 2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. There are 3 non-abelian groups of order 48.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5 abelian groups + 3 non-abelian groups = 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 48."
