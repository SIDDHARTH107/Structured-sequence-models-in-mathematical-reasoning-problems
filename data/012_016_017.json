    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of graph G, we first need to identify the number of connected components (k), the number of vertices (n), and the number of edges (m) in the graph. In this case, k = 1, n = 5, and m = 7.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T_G(x, y) is defined as:\n\nT_G(x, y) = (x - 1)^(k - n + m) * T_G'(x, y)\n\nwhere T_G'(x, y) is the reduced Tutte polynomial, which can be found using the recursive deletion-contraction formula:\n\nT_G'(x, y) = T_H'(x, y) + T_K'(x, y)\n\nwhere H is the graph obtained by deleting an edge e from G, and K is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e in G.\n\nLet's choose edge e connecting vertices 1 and 2. We will delete this edge to obtain graph H and contract this edge to obtain graph K.\n\nGraph H:\n\n```\n    1      2\n     \\    / \n      \\  /  \n       \\/   \n       /\\   \n      /  \\  \n     /    \\ \n    3 ----- 4\n         |    \n         |    \n         |    \n         5    \n```\n\nGraph K:\n\n```\n    1-2\n     \\|\n      \\\n       \\\n        3\n         |    \n         |    \n         |    \n         5    \n```\n\nNow we need to find the reduced Tutte polynomials T_H'(x, y) and T_K'(x, y).\n\nFor graph H, we have k = 1, n = 5, and m = 6. Since H is a tree (connected graph with no cycles), its reduced Tutte polynomial is:\n\nT_H'(x, y) = x^(n - k) = x^(5 - 1) = x^4\n\nFor graph K, we have k = 1, n = 4, and m = 5. The graph K is also a tree, so its reduced Tutte polynomial is:\n\nT_K'(x, y) = x^(n - k) = x^(4 - 1) = x^3\n\nNow we can use the deletion-contraction formula to find the reduced Tutte polynomial of graph G:\n\nT_G'(x, y) = T_H'(x, y) + T_K'(x, y) = x^4 + x^3\n\nFinally, we can find the Tutte polynomial of graph G:\n\nT_G(x, y) = (x - 1)^(k - n + m) * T_G'(x, y) = (x - 1)^(1 - 5 + 7) * (x^4 + x^3) = (x - 1)^3 * (x^4 + x^3)\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of graph G is:\n\nT_G(x, y) = (x - 1)^3 * (x^4 + x^3)"
