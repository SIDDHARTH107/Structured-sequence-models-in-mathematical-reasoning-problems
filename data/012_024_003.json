    "message_2": "To determine the genus of a graph G, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nIn this case, we have V = 5 and E = 7. We need to find the minimum genus g such that the graph can be embedded in a surface of genus g without edge crossings.\n\nFirst, let's check if the graph is planar (g = 0). A necessary condition for a graph to be planar is that it satisfies the inequality:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nFor our graph, we have:\n\n7 ≤ 3(5) - 6\n7 ≤ 9\n\nThis inequality holds, but it doesn't guarantee that the graph is planar. We need to check if there is a planar embedding of the graph.\n\nHowever, since we don't have the specific graph structure, we cannot determine if it is planar or not. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact genus of this graph without more information about its structure."
