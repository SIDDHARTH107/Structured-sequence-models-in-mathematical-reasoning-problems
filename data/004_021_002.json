    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x).\n\nUsing the power rule, we have:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 6\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), by taking the derivative of f'(x):\n\nf''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x + 6\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x is f''(x) = 12x^2 - 24x + 6."
