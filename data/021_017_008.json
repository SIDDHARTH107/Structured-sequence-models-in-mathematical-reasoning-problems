    "message_1": "Sure! Here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in the subtopic of Solving optimization problems using differential evolution:\n\nA company is trying to optimize the design of a wind turbine. The turbine has four design parameters: blade length (m), blade pitch angle (degrees), airfoil shape (coded as a number), and number of blades. The company wants to maximize the power output (kW) of the wind turbine subject to the following constraints: (i) the blade length must be between 20 and 40 meters, (ii) the blade pitch angle must be between -10 and 10 degrees, (iii) the airfoil shape must be one of four specific designs (coded as 1, 2, 3, or 4), and (iv) the number of blades must be either 2, 3, or 4. \n\nUse differential evolution to find the combination of design parameters that maximizes the power output of the wind turbine subject to the constraints. Given the objective function for power output as f(x), where x is the vector of design parameters, find the optimal design with a minimum of 50 generations, a population size of 100, and a mutation factor of 0.5.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using differential evolution, we first need to define the objective function f(x) that calculates the power output of the wind turbine based on the design parameters. Since the actual function is not provided, I will use a placeholder function f(x) = -x1^2 - x2^2 - x3^2 - x4^2, where x1, x2, x3, and x4 are the design parameters. The goal is to maximize this function.\n\nHere's a Python implementation using the `scipy.optimize.differential_evolution` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\ndef objective_function(x):\n    x1, x2, x3, x4 = x\n    return -x1**2 - x2**2 - x3**2 - x4**2\n\ndef constraint_airfoil_shape(x):\n    return int(x[2]) in [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\ndef constraint_number_of_blades(x):\n    return int(x[3]) in [2, 3, 4]\n\nbounds = [(20, 40), (-10, 10), (1, 4), (2, 4)]\n\nresult = differential_evolution(\n    objective_function,\n    bounds,\n    strategy='best1bin',\n    popsize=100,\n    mutation=0.5,\n    recombination=0.7,\n    maxiter=50,\n    constraints=[constraint_airfoil_shape, constraint_number_of_blades],\n    polish=True,\n    seed=42\n)\n\nprint(\"Optimal design parameters:\", result.x)\nprint(\"Maximum power output:\", -result.fun)\n```\n\nPlease note that this solution uses a placeholder objective function, and you should replace it with the actual function that calculates the power output of the wind turbine based on the design parameters. The solution also assumes that the airfoil shape and the number of blades are continuous variables during the optimization process and then rounded to the nearest integer to satisfy the constraints."
