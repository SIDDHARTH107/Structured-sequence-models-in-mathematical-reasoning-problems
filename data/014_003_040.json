    "message_1": "Suppose you are using ElGamal encryption to send a message to your friend. The prime number p is 29 and the generator g is 2. Your private key is x = 5, and you choose a random number k = 6. The message you want to encrypt is m = 11. Find the encrypted message (ciphertext) and the corresponding decryption (plaintext) using ElGamal encryption and decryption algorithm.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message using ElGamal encryption, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the public key y:\ny = g^x mod p\ny = 2^5 mod 29\ny = 32 mod 29\ny = 3\n\n2. Calculate the ephemeral key K:\nK = y^k mod p\nK = 3^6 mod 29\nK = 729 mod 29\nK = 9\n\n3. Calculate the ciphertext components c1 and c2:\nc1 = g^k mod p\nc1 = 2^6 mod 29\nc1 = 64 mod 29\nc1 = 6\n\nc2 = m * K mod p\nc2 = 11 * 9 mod 29\nc2 = 99 mod 29\nc2 = 12\n\nSo, the encrypted message (ciphertext) is (c1, c2) = (6, 12).\n\nNow, let's decrypt the message using ElGamal decryption:\n\n1. Calculate the shared secret S:\nS = c1^(p-1-x) mod p\nS = 6^(29-1-5) mod 29\nS = 6^23 mod 29\nS = 13841287201 mod 29\nS = 9\n\n2. Calculate the plaintext message m:\nm = c2 * S^-1 mod p\nTo find the inverse of S, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or Fermat's Little Theorem. Using Fermat's Little Theorem:\nS^-1 = S^(p-2) mod p\nS^-1 = 9^(29-2) mod 29\nS^-1 = 9^27 mod 29\nS^-1 = 672749994932560009201 mod 29\nS^-1 = 4\n\nNow, calculate m:\nm = 12 * 4 mod 29\nm = 48 mod 29\nm = 11\n\nThe decrypted message (plaintext) is m = 11, which is the same as the original message."
