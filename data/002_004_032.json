    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). In this case, the length is 10 centimeters and the width is 8 centimeters.\n\nPerimeter = 2(10 + 8)\nPerimeter = 2(18)\nPerimeter = 36 centimeters\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 36 centimeters."
