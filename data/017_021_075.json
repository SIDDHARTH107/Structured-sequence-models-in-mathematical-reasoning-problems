    "message_2": "Given the multiplication table, we can observe some properties of the group G. First, we can see that the group is non-abelian since the multiplication table is not symmetric along the diagonal. This means that G is not isomorphic to the cyclic group C48 or the alternating group A4 × C4.\n\nNow, we need to find which of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48 G is isomorphic to. To do this, we can analyze the structure of the group G by looking at the orders of its elements and the subgroups they generate.\n\nNotice that the element 'a' has order 4, as a^4 = e. Similarly, the element 'f' has order 12, as f^12 = e. We can also see that the elements 'b', 'c', 'd', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', and 'y' have order 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the subgroups generated by the elements 'a' and 'f'. The subgroup generated by 'a' is {e, a, a^2, a^3}, and the subgroup generated by 'f' is {e, f, f^2, ..., f^11}. Since the orders of these subgroups are 4 and 12, and their product is 48, we can conclude that G is a semi-direct product of these two subgroups.\n\nBy analyzing the multiplication table, we can see that the action of the subgroup generated by 'f' on the subgroup generated by 'a' is non-trivial. This means that G is a non-abelian semi-direct product of the two subgroups.\n\nBased on the properties we have observed, we can conclude that G is isomorphic to one of the 14 non-abelian groups of order 48. However, without further information about the specific structure of these 14 groups, we cannot determine exactly which group G is isomorphic to."
