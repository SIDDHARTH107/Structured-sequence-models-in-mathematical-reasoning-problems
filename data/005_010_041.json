    "message_1": "A quality control manager is examining a batch of 50 circuit boards produced by a company. The manager knows that 5% of the boards are defective. Using Bayesian statistics, what is the probability that at least 3 of the boards in the batch are defective?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 3 of the boards in the batch are defective, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective boards\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k defective boards from n total boards (in this case, n = 50)\n- p is the probability of a board being defective (in this case, p = 0.05)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a board not being defective (in this case, 1-p = 0.95)\n- n is the total number of boards (in this case, n = 50)\n- k is the number of defective boards (in this case, we want to find the probability of having at least 3 defective boards)\n\nTo find the probability of having at least 3 defective boards, we can find the probability of having 0, 1, or 2 defective boards and then subtract that from 1:\n\nP(X >= 3) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 2)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each case:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(50, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (0.95)^50 ≈ 0.000000181\nP(X = 1) = C(50, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (0.95)^49 ≈ 0.0000159\nP(X = 2) = C(50, 2) * (0.05)^2 * (0.95)^48 ≈ 0.00056\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the equation for P(X >= 3):\n\nP(X >= 3) = 1 - 0.000000181 - 0.0000159 - 0.00056 ≈ 0.999423919\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 of the boards in the batch are defective is approximately 0.9994 or 99.94%."
