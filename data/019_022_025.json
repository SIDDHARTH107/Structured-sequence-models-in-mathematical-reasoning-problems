The outcomes and probabilities for each option are:\n\nOption A: \nOutcome X with probability 0.3 \nOutcome Y with probability 0.6 \nOutcome Z with probability 0.1 \n\nOption B: \nOutcome X with probability 0.1 \nOutcome Y with probability 0.4 \nOutcome Z with probability 0.5 \n\nOption C: \nOutcome X with probability 0.5 \nOutcome Y with probability 0.3 \nOutcome Z with probability 0.2 \n\nIf the decision-maker wants to choose the option that maximizes their expected value, which option should they choose?",
    "message_2": "To determine which option maximizes the expected value, we need to assign values to each outcome (X, Y, and Z). Let's assume the values are as follows:\n\nValue of Outcome X: Vx\nValue of Outcome Y: Vy\nValue of Outcome Z: Vz\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value for each option:\n\nExpected Value of Option A = (0.3 * Vx) + (0.6 * Vy) + (0.1 * Vz)\nExpected Value of Option B = (0.1 * Vx) + (0.4 * Vy) + (0.5 * Vz)\nExpected Value of Option C = (0.5 * Vx) + (0.3 * Vy) + (0.2 * Vz)\n\nWithout knowing the specific values of Vx, Vy, and Vz, we cannot definitively determine which option has the highest expected value. The decision-maker should assign values to the outcomes based on their preferences and then calculate the expected values for each option to make an informed decision."
