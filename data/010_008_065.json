    "message_2": "Let's analyze the simplicial complex formed by two tetrahedrons sharing a common face.\n\nVertices (V): Each tetrahedron has 4 vertices, but since they share a common face, they share 3 vertices. So, there are a total of 4 + 4 - 3 = 5 vertices.\n\nEdges (E): Each tetrahedron has 6 edges, but since they share a common face, they share 3 edges. So, there are a total of 6 + 6 - 3 = 9 edges.\n\nFaces (F): Each tetrahedron has 4 faces, but since they share a common face, they share 1 face. So, there are a total of 4 + 4 - 1 = 7 faces.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Euler characteristic (χ) using the formula:\n\nχ = V - E + F\n\nχ = 5 - 9 + 7\n\nχ = 3\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex formed by two tetrahedrons sharing a common face is 3."
