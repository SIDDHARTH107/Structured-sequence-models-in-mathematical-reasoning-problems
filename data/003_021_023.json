    "message_1": "Tom is walking towards North at a speed of 5 m/s. He changes his direction and starts walking towards East at a speed of 7 m/s. What is the angle between his initial and final direction vectors, using trigonometry?",
    "message_2": "To find the angle between Tom's initial and final direction vectors, we can use the dot product formula for two vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A • B) / (||A|| ||B||)\n\nwhere A and B are the two vectors, θ is the angle between them, A • B is the dot product of the two vectors, and ||A|| and ||B|| are the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nIn this case, the initial direction vector A is (0, 5) since Tom is walking North, and the final direction vector B is (7, 0) since he is walking East.\n\nThe dot product A • B = (0 * 7) + (5 * 0) = 0.\n\nThe magnitudes of the vectors are ||A|| = sqrt(0^2 + 5^2) = 5 and ||B|| = sqrt(7^2 + 0^2) = 7.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the dot product formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (0) / (5 * 7) = 0\n\nSince cos(θ) = 0, the angle θ between the two vectors is 90 degrees (or π/2 radians)."
