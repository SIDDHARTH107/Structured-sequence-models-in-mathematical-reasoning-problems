    "message_2": "To determine the value of the European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need the following inputs:\n\n1. Stock price (S): $100\n2. Strike price (K): $120\n3. Time to maturity (T): 0.5 years (6 months)\n4. Volatility (σ): 0.25\n5. Risk-free interest rate (r): This value is not provided, so we will assume a common value of 0.05 (5%).\n\nThe Black-Scholes equation for the value of a European call option (C) is given by:\n\nC = S * N(d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere N(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and d1 and d2 are given by:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/K) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * sqrt(T))\nd2 = d1 - σ * sqrt(T)\n\nFirst, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/120) + (0.05 + (0.25^2)/2) * 0.5) / (0.25 * sqrt(0.5))\nd1 ≈ -0.3398\n\nd2 = d1 - 0.25 * sqrt(0.5)\nd2 ≈ -0.5898\n\nNow, we can use these values to calculate the value of the call option:\n\nC = 100 * N(-0.3398) - 120 * e^(-0.05 * 0.5) * N(-0.5898)\nC ≈ 100 * 0.3671 - 120 * 0.9753 * 0.2776\nC ≈ 36.71 - 32.37\nC ≈ 4.34\n\nTherefore, the value of the European call option is approximately $4.34."
