    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using block matrices, we first write the system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2  3 |\n    | 2  4  6 |\n    | 1  1  2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 17 |\n    | 20 |\n    |  8 |\n\nNow, we partition the matrix A into block matrices. We can partition it into a 2x2 block matrix in the upper left corner and a 1x1 block matrix in the lower right corner:\n\nA = | A11 A12 | = | | 3  2 |  3 |\n    |  0  A22 |   | | 2  4 |  6 |\n                   |   1  1 |  2 |\n\nA11 = | 3  2 |\n      | 2  4 |\n\nA12 = | 3 |\n      | 6 |\n\nA22 = | 2 |\n\nNow we can write the system of linear equations in block matrix form:\n\n| A11 A12 | | x |   | 17 |\n|         | |   | = |    |\n|  0  A22 | | z |   |  8 |\n\nWe can now solve the block matrix system in two steps:\n\n1. Solve A11 * X1 + A12 * z = B1 for X1, where X1 = | x |\n                                                        | y |\n   and B1 = | 17 |\n            | 20 |\n\n2. Solve A22 * z = B2 - A21 * X1 for z, where B2 = 8.\n\nStep 1:\nA11 * X1 + A12 * z = B1\n| 3  2 | | x |   | 3 |   | 17 |\n| 2  4 | | y | + | 6 | = | 20 |\n\nWe can solve this system of linear equations for x and y:\n3x + 2y = 14\n2x + 4y = 8\n\nDivide the second equation by 2:\nx + 2y = 4\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n2y = 10\ny = 5\n\nSubstitute y back into the second equation:\nx + 2(5) = 4\nx = -6\n\nSo, X1 = | -6 |\n         |  5 |\n\nStep 2:\nA22 * z = B2 - A21 * X1\n2z = 8 - 1 * (-6) - 1 * 5\n2z = 8 + 6 - 5\n2z = 9\nz = 4.5\n\nNow we have the values for x, y, and z:\nx = -6\ny = 5\nz = 4.5"
