The profit and resource requirements for each project are as follows: \n\n| Project | Profit | Resource Requirement |\n|---------|--------|----------------------|\n| A       | 60     | 50                   |\n| B       | 90     | 70                   |\n| C       | 100    | 80                   |\n\nHow should the company allocate the resources to maximize the total profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total profit, we need to find the most efficient allocation of resources among the three projects. We can start by calculating the profit per unit of resource for each project:\n\nProfit per unit of resource = Profit / Resource Requirement\n\nProject A: 60 / 50 = 1.2\nProject B: 90 / 70 = 1.286\nProject C: 100 / 80 = 1.25\n\nProject B has the highest profit per unit of resource, so we should prioritize allocating resources to Project B. However, we also need to consider the resource requirements of each project.\n\nSince we have 200 units of resources, we can allocate resources to all three projects as follows:\n\n1. Allocate 70 units of resources to Project B (the remaining resource units are 200 - 70 = 130).\n2. Allocate 80 units of resources to Project C (the remaining resource units are 130 - 80 = 50).\n3. Allocate the remaining 50 units of resources to Project A.\n\nWith this allocation, the company can complete all three projects and maximize the total profit:\n\nTotal profit = Profit from Project A + Profit from Project B + Profit from Project C\nTotal profit = 60 + 90 + 100\nTotal profit = 250"
