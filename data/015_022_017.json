    "message_2": "To solve the Mackey-Glass equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, we will first define the function for the equation and then implement the Runge-Kutta method. \n\nLet's define the function f(t, x) as:\n\nf(t, x) = (0.2 * x(t-17)) / (1 + x(t-17)^10) - 0.1 * x(t)\n\nNow, we will implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a time step of ∆t = 0.1:\n\n1. Initialize the variables: t = 0, x = 1.5, ∆t = 0.1, and t_end = 1000.\n2. Create a function to interpolate the value of x at t-17 using the previous values of x.\n3. Implement the Runge-Kutta method:\n\n   a. Calculate k1 = ∆t * f(t, x)\n   b. Calculate k2 = ∆t * f(t + 0.5 * ∆t, x + 0.5 * k1)\n   c. Calculate k3 = ∆t * f(t + 0.5 * ∆t, x + 0.5 * k2)\n   d. Calculate k4 = ∆t * f(t + ∆t, x + k3)\n   e. Update x = x + (k1 + 2 * k2 + 2 * k3 + k4) / 6\n   f. Update t = t + ∆t\n   g. Repeat steps a-f until t >= t_end\n\nPlease note that as an AI language model, I am unable to execute code or provide numerical solutions directly. However, you can implement the above algorithm in a programming language like Python, MATLAB, or any other language of your choice to obtain the solution for the given time span."
