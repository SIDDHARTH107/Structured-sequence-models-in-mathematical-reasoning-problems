    "message_1": "A student must optimize the production of two types of t-shirts, A and B. The cost of producing a t-shirt A is $5 and the cost of producing a t-shirt B is $7. The selling price of t-shirt A is $10 and the selling price of t-shirt B is $12. The student has a total budget of $4200 and wants to maximize the profit. Find the optimal number of t-shirts A and B that should be produced to achieve the highest profit, given that at least 500 t-shirts of type A should be produced.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of t-shirts A produced and y be the number of t-shirts B produced. The profit for each t-shirt A is $10 - $5 = $5, and the profit for each t-shirt B is $12 - $7 = $5. The total profit can be represented as P = 5x + 5y.\n\nThe total cost of producing x t-shirts A and y t-shirts B should not exceed the budget of $4200. This can be represented as 5x + 7y ≤ 4200.\n\nSince at least 500 t-shirts A should be produced, we have x ≥ 500.\n\nNow, we need to maximize the profit P = 5x + 5y subject to the constraints 5x + 7y ≤ 4200 and x ≥ 500.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum number of t-shirts B that can be produced with the remaining budget after producing 500 t-shirts A:\n\n5(500) + 7y ≤ 4200\n2500 + 7y ≤ 4200\n7y ≤ 1700\ny ≤ 242.857\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a t-shirt, the maximum number of t-shirts B that can be produced is 242.\n\nNow, let's check if producing 500 t-shirts A and 242 t-shirts B maximizes the profit:\n\nP = 5x + 5y = 5(500) + 5(242) = 2500 + 1210 = $3710\n\nIf we try to produce one more t-shirt B and one less t-shirt A, we would have:\n\nP = 5(499) + 5(243) = 2495 + 1215 = $3710\n\nThe profit remains the same. Therefore, the optimal number of t-shirts A and B that should be produced to achieve the highest profit is 500 t-shirts A and 242 t-shirts B, with a total profit of $3710."
