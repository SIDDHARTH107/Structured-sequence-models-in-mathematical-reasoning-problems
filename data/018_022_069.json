    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both.\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B ∆ A.\n\nB ∆ A = {1, 4}\n\nNotice that A ∆ B = B ∆ A, which means the symmetric difference is the same in both cases.\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) and (B ∆ A). The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in the first set and b is in the second set.\n\n(A ∆ B) x (B ∆ A) = {(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)}\n\nSince the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) and (B ∆ A) is the same, the result is the same."
