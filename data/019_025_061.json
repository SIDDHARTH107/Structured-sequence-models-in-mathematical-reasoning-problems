    "message_2": "To find out how many units the factory will produce per day with the new machine, we first need to calculate the increase in production. \n\nThe increase in production is 20% of the current production, which is 5000 units per day. \n\n20% of 5000 = (20/100) * 5000 = 1000 units\n\nNow, we add this increase to the current production to find the total production with the new machine:\n\nTotal production with the new machine = Current production + Increase in production\nTotal production with the new machine = 5000 units + 1000 units = 6000 units\n\nSo, the factory will produce 6000 units per day with the new machine."
