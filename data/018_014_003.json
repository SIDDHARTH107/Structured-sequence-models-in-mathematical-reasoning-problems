    "message_2": "First, let's find (A ∩ B)'.\n\nA ∩ B represents the intersection of sets A and B, which means the elements that are common to both sets. Since there are no common elements in A and B, A ∩ B = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A ∩ B, denoted as (A ∩ B)'. The complement of a set contains all the elements that are not in the set but are in the universal set. Since A ∩ B = ∅, (A ∩ B)' would be the universal set, denoted as U.\n\nNext, let's find A' and B'. A' represents the complement of set A, which contains all the elements that are not in A but are in the universal set. Similarly, B' represents the complement of set B. Let's assume the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4} for simplicity.\n\nA' = {3, 4}\nB' = {1, 2}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A' and B', denoted as (A' x B').\n\nA' x B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the Cartesian product of A' and B', denoted as (A' x B')'.\n\nTo find the complement of the Cartesian product, we need to find all the ordered pairs that are not in A' x B' but are in the universal set. The Cartesian product of the universal set U x U would be:\n\nU x U = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nNow, let's remove the elements of A' x B' from U x U:\n\n(A' x B')' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nFinally, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B)' and (A' x B'), denoted as ((A ∩ B)' x (A' x B')).\n\nSince (A ∩ B)' is the universal set U, we can rewrite this as (U x (A' x B')).\n\nHowever, the Cartesian product of a set with another set containing ordered pairs is not well-defined. In other words, we cannot find the Cartesian product of a set of single elements with a set of ordered pairs. Therefore, we cannot find ((A ∩ B)' x (A' x B')).\n\nIn conclusion, the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B)' and (A' x B') is not equal to the complement of the Cartesian product of A' and B', as the former is not well-defined."
