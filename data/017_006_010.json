    "message_2": "To find all possible group structures of a group of order 35, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 35 is $35 = 5 \\cdot 7$. \n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, denoted by $n_5$, must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The possible values for $n_5$ are 1 and 7. Similarly, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups, denoted by $n_7$, must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The possible values for $n_7$ are 1 and 5.\n\nNow, we consider the possible combinations of $n_5$ and $n_7$:\n\n1. $n_5 = 1$ and $n_7 = 1$: In this case, there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup and a unique 7-Sylow subgroup. Let these subgroups be $P_5$ and $P_7$, respectively. Since the orders of $P_5$ and $P_7$ are coprime, their intersection is trivial, i.e., $P_5 \\cap P_7 = \\{e\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. By the product formula, we have $|P_5P_7| = \\frac{|P_5||P_7|}{|P_5 \\cap P_7|} = 5 \\cdot 7 = 35$. Therefore, the group is the internal direct product of $P_5$ and $P_7$, and is isomorphic to the cyclic group $C_{35} \\cong C_5 \\times C_7$.\n\n2. $n_5 = 7$ and $n_7 = 5$: In this case, there are 7 5-Sylow subgroups and 5 7-Sylow subgroups. However, this situation is not possible, because it would imply that there are at least $7(5-1) + 5(7-1) = 40$ distinct non-identity elements in the group, which contradicts the fact that the group has only 35 elements.\n\nTherefore, there is only one group structure up to isomorphism for a group of order 35, and that is the cyclic group $C_{35} \\cong C_5 \\times C_7$."
