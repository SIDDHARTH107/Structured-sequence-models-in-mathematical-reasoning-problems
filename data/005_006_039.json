    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 1500 hours, the population standard deviation (σ) is 200 hours, and the sample size (n) is 36 bulbs.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample means, which is given by:\n\nσ_sample = σ / √n = 200 / √36 = 200 / 6 = 33.33 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of sample mean lifespans (1420 and 1550 hours). The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ_sample\n\nFor 1420 hours:\n\nz1 = (1420 - 1500) / 33.33 ≈ -2.40\n\nFor 1550 hours:\n\nz2 = (1550 - 1500) / 33.33 ≈ 1.50\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean lifespan falls between these z-scores. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area under the standard normal curve between these z-scores.\n\nP(-2.40 < z < 1.50) = P(z < 1.50) - P(z < -2.40)\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find:\n\nP(z < 1.50) ≈ 0.9332\nP(z < -2.40) ≈ 0.0082\n\nTherefore, the probability that the mean lifespan of the sample will be between 1420 and 1550 hours is:\n\nP(1420 < X < 1550) = 0.9332 - 0.0082 = 0.9250\n\nSo, there is approximately a 92.50% chance that the mean lifespan of the sample will be between 1420 and 1550 hours."
