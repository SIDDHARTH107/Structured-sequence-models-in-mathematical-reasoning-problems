    "message_2": "We can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to solve this problem. The MVT states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one value c in the open interval (a, b) such that the average rate of change of the function over the interval is equal to the instantaneous rate of change at c. Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\nf'(c) = (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a)\n\nIn this problem, we have a = 0, b = 5, f(a) = 2, and f(b) = 10. We want to find a value c in the open interval (0, 5) such that f'(c) = 2. Plugging these values into the MVT equation, we get:\n\n2 = (10 - 2) / (5 - 0)\n\n2 = 8 / 5\n\nNow, we can see that the average rate of change of the function over the interval [0, 5] is 8/5. Since the function is continuous and differentiable, by the MVT, there must exist at least one value c in the open interval (0, 5) such that f'(c) = 8/5.\n\nHowever, we are asked to find a value c such that f'(c) = 2. Since the MVT guarantees a value c with f'(c) = 8/5, but not necessarily a value with f'(c) = 2, we cannot guarantee the existence of such a value c with the given information."
