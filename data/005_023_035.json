Determine if there are any outliers in the data using the Tukey method with a lower fence of 62 and an upper fence of 102.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there are any outliers in the data using the Tukey method, we first need to find the interquartile range (IQR). To do this, we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n\nFirst, let's arrange the scores in ascending order:\n\n65, 68, 72, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 85, 89, 90, 91, 92, 95, 98, 100\n\nThere are 20 scores, so the middle is between the 10th and 11th scores. Therefore, the second quartile (Q2) is the average of the 10th and 11th scores:\n\nQ2 = (81 + 83) / 2 = 82\n\nNow, we need to find Q1, which is the median of the lower half of the data (the first 10 scores):\n\nQ1 = (76 + 77) / 2 = 76.5\n\nNext, we need to find Q3, which is the median of the upper half of the data (the last 10 scores):\n\nQ3 = (89 + 90) / 2 = 89.5\n\nNow we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 89.5 - 76.5 = 13\n\nNow we can calculate the lower and upper fences using the given values:\n\nLower fence = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 76.5 - 1.5 * 13 = 76.5 - 19.5 = 57\nUpper fence = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 89.5 + 1.5 * 13 = 89.5 + 19.5 = 109\n\nNow we can check if there are any outliers in the data by comparing the scores to the lower and upper fences:\n\n65, 68, 72, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 85, 89, 90, 91, 92, 95, 98, 100\n\nAll the scores are within the range of the lower fence (57) and the upper fence (109). Therefore, there are no outliers in the data using the Tukey method with a lower fence of 62 and an upper fence of 102."
