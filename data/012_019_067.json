    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of the graph such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn order to determine the chromatic index of the graph G, we can use Vizing's Theorem, which states that for any simple, undirected graph G, its chromatic index χ'(G) satisfies:\n\nΔ(G) ≤ χ'(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1\n\nwhere Δ(G) is the maximum degree of the vertices in G.\n\nFirst, we need to find the maximum degree of the vertices in G. Since G has 9 vertices and 15 edges, the average degree of the vertices is (2 * 15) / 9 ≈ 3.33. Therefore, the maximum degree Δ(G) must be at least 4.\n\nNow, we can apply Vizing's Theorem:\n\n4 ≤ χ'(G) ≤ 5\n\nWe need to determine if there exists a proper edge coloring of G with 4 colors. If there is, then the chromatic index is 4; otherwise, it is 5.\n\nUnfortunately, without more information about the specific structure of the graph G, we cannot definitively determine whether a 4-coloring exists. However, we can conclude that the chromatic index of G is either 4 or 5."
