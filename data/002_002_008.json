    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3) × π × r^3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the sphere is 10 cm, the radius (r) is half of the diameter:\n\nr = 10 cm / 2 = 5 cm\n\nNow, we can plug the radius into the formula:\n\nVolume = (4/3) × π × (5 cm)^3\nVolume = (4/3) × π × 125 cm^3\nVolume = 4 × π × 41.67 cm^3 (rounded to two decimal places)\nVolume ≈ 4 × 3.14 × 41.67 cm^3\nVolume ≈ 12.56 × 41.67 cm^3\nVolume ≈ 523.33 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere is approximately 523.33 cubic centimeters, correct to two decimal places."
