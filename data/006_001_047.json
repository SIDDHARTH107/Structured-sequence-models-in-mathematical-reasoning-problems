    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 flips of a fair coin, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(x) = (n! / (k!(n-k)!)) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (heads) in n trials (flips)\n- n is the number of trials (flips), which is 100 in this case\n- k is the number of successes (heads), which is 50 in this case\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n- n! is the factorial of n (the product of all positive integers up to n)\n- k! is the factorial of k\n- (n-k)! is the factorial of (n-k)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(50) = (100! / (50! * 50!)) * (0.5^50) * (0.5^50)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the factorials and probabilities, we find:\n\nP(50) â‰ˆ 0.0795892\n\nSo the probability of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 flips of a fair coin is approximately 7.96%."
