    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA metal plate of thickness 2 cm and thermal conductivity 20 W/mK has an initial temperature of 50°C. One face of the plate is suddenly exposed to a constant heat flux of 1000 W/m2, while the other face is maintained at a constant temperature of 20°C. Using the Fourier transform method, calculate the temperature distribution within the plate after 1 minute.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional unsteady-state heat conduction equation with the Fourier transform method. The equation is as follows:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature distribution within the plate, α is the thermal diffusivity (α = k/(ρ*Cp)), k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density, and Cp is the specific heat capacity of the material.\n\nFirst, we need to find the thermal diffusivity (α) of the metal plate. We are given the thermal conductivity (k = 20 W/mK), but we need the density (ρ) and specific heat capacity (Cp) of the material. Since these values are not provided, we will assume typical values for a metal: ρ = 8000 kg/m³ and Cp = 500 J/kgK. Now"
