    "message_2": "The set $X$ is both connected and path-connected.\n\nConnectedness:\nA set is connected if it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint nonempty open subsets. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $X$ can be represented as the union of two disjoint nonempty open subsets $A$ and $B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are open, there exist open balls $B(a, r_a) \\subseteq A$ and $B(b, r_b) \\subseteq B$ for some $a, b \\in X$ and $r_a, r_b > 0$. However, since $X$ is a disk, there must exist a point $c$ on the line segment connecting $a$ and $b$ such that $c \\in X$. But $c$ must belong to either $A$ or $B$, which contradicts the fact that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. Therefore, $X$ is connected.\n\nPath-connectedness:\nA set is path-connected if for any two points $p, q \\in X$, there exists a continuous function $f: [0, 1] \\to X$ such that $f(0) = p$ and $f(1) = q$. Let $p = (x_1, y_1)$ and $q = (x_2, y_2)$ be any two points in $X$. Define the function $f(t) = (1-t)p + tq = ((1-t)x_1 + tx_2, (1-t)y_1 + ty_2)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$. It is clear that $f(0) = p$ and $f(1) = q$. \n\nNow we need to show that $f(t)$ is continuous and maps to $X$. The function $f(t)$ is continuous since it is a linear combination of continuous functions. To show that $f(t) \\in X$, we need to prove that $(1-t)p + tq$ lies inside the unit disk for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. Let $d(t) = (1-t)p + tq$. Then, we have:\n\n$d(t)^2 = ((1-t)x_1 + tx_2)^2 + ((1-t)y_1 + ty_2)^2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$d(t)^2 = (1-t)^2(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + t^2(x_2^2 + y_2^2) + 2t(1-t)(x_1x_2 + y_1y_2)$\n\nSince $p, q \\in X$, we have $x_1^2 + y_1^2 \\leq 1$ and $x_2^2 + y_2^2 \\leq 1$. Therefore, $(1-t)^2(x_1^2 + y_1^2) \\leq (1-t)^2$ and $t^2(x_2^2 + y_2^2) \\leq t^2$. Also, $-1 \\leq x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 \\leq 1$. Thus, we have:\n\n$d(t)^2 \\leq (1-t)^2 + t^2 + 2t(1-t) = 1$\n\nThis implies that $d(t) \\in X$ for all $t \\in [0, 1]$. Hence, $X$ is path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the set $X$ is both connected and path-connected."
