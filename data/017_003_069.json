    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g. Since the order of G is 7, we know that there are 7 elements in G, including the identity element e.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Since 7 is prime, the only divisors of 7 are 1 and 7. Thus, the order of any element in G must be either 1 or 7. The only element with order 1 is the identity element e. Therefore, if we can find an element with order 7, we can conclude that G is cyclic.\n\nLet g be an element in G such that g ≠ e. Since the order of g must divide 7, and g ≠ e, the order of g must be 7. This means that the powers of g are distinct and generate all non-identity elements of G:\n\n{g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6}\n\nSince G has 7 elements and we have generated 6 non-identity elements, the only remaining element is the identity element e. We know that g^7 = e (by the definition of the order of an element). Therefore, the set of all powers of g is:\n\n{e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6}\n\nThis set contains all 7 elements of G, so G is indeed cyclic, and g is a generator of G."
