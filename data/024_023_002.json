    "message_2": "The manifold M is defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1, which represents a sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The symmetry group of M consists of all invertible transformations that leave M invariant, meaning that after applying the transformation, the manifold remains unchanged.\n\nThe symmetry group of M is the orthogonal group O(3), which consists of all 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant Â±1. These matrices represent rotations and reflections in three-dimensional space that preserve the Euclidean distance between points. Since M is a sphere centered at the origin, any rotation or reflection that fixes the origin will leave M invariant.\n\nTo see why this is the case, let A be an orthogonal matrix in O(3). Then for any point (x, y, z) on M, we have:\n\n||A(x, y, z)||^2 = (A(x, y, z))^T(A(x, y, z)) = (x, y, z)^T(A^TA)(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)^T(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\n\nHere, ||A(x, y, z)||^2 denotes the squared Euclidean norm of the transformed point, and we used the fact that A^TA = I for orthogonal matrices A. Since ||A(x, y, z)||^2 = 1, the transformed point A(x, y, z) also lies on M, and so the transformation A leaves M invariant.\n\nConversely, any transformation that leaves M invariant must preserve the Euclidean distance between points and thus must be an orthogonal transformation. Therefore, the symmetry group of M is the orthogonal group O(3)."
