    "message_1": "A student has a knapsack that can hold a maximum weight of 15 kg. There are 5 items, each with a weight and a value:\n\n- Item 1: Weight = 6 kg, Value = $12\n- Item 2: Weight = 2 kg, Value = $4\n- Item 3: Weight = 8 kg, Value = $10\n- Item 4: Weight = 5 kg, Value = $8\n- Item 5: Weight = 4 kg, Value = $5\n\nWhat is the optimal combination of items that the student should select to maximize the value of the items in their knapsack?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will create a table to store the maximum value that can be obtained with a given weight capacity and a certain number of items.\n\nLet's create a table with 6 rows (including 0 items) and 16 columns (including 0 kg capacity). The rows represent the number of items (0 to 5) and the columns represent the weight capacity (0 to 15 kg).\n\nWe will fill the table row by row, starting with the first item. For each cell, we will compare the value of including the current item with the value of not including it, and choose the maximum.\n\nHere's the filled table:\n\n```\n  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 (Weight capacity)\n0 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0\n1 0  0  0  0  0  0 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12\n2 0  0  4  4  4  4 12 12 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16\n3 0  0  4  4  4  4 12 12 16 16 16 16 20 20 20 20\n4 0  0  4  4  8  8 12 12 16 16 20 20 20 20 24 24\n5 0  0  4  5  8  9 12 13 16 17 20 21 20 21 24 25\n```\n\nThe maximum value that can be obtained with a weight capacity of 15 kg and all 5 items is 25 (bottom right cell).\n\nNow, let's find the optimal combination of items. Starting from the bottom right cell, we will move up the table until we find a cell with a different value. When we find such a cell, it means that the item in the current row was included in the optimal solution, and we should move to the left by the weight of that item.\n\nHere's the path:\n\n1. Start at (5, 15) with value 25.\n2. Move up to (4, 15) with value 24.\n3. Move up to (3, 15) with value 20. The value changed, so include item 3 and move left by its weight (8 kg) to (2, 7).\n4. Move up to (1, 7) with value 12. The value changed, so include item 1 and move left by its weight (6 kg) to (0, 1).\n\nThe optimal combination of items is item 1 and item 3, with a total value of $22 (12 + 10) and a total weight of 14 kg (6 + 8)."
