    "message_2": "To solve this problem using Bézout's theorem, we first need to express the given equations as homogeneous polynomials. \n\nThe given equations are:\n1. x² + y² = 25\n2. x + y = 7\n\nTo make these equations homogeneous, we introduce a new variable z. The homogeneous equations will be:\n1. x² + y² - 25z² = 0\n2. x + y - 7z = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the degrees of these homogeneous polynomials. The degree of the first polynomial is 2 (since the highest power of any variable is 2), and the degree of the second polynomial is 1 (since the highest power of any variable is 1).\n\nAccording to Bézout's theorem, the number of intersection points between two curves is equal to the product of the degrees of their defining polynomials, assuming that the intersection points are in general position (i.e., no intersection points coincide, and no intersection points are at infinity).\n\nIn this case, the product of the degrees is 2 * 1 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 intersection points between the curves given by the equations x² + y² = 25 and x + y = 7, assuming that the intersection points are in general position."
