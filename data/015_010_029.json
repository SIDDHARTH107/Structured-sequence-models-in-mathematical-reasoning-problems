    "message_2": "1. Determine the fixed points of the system in terms of a.\n\nTo find the fixed points, we need to set both dx/dt and dy/dt equal to zero and solve for x and y.\n\n0 = -y + ax(1 - x^2 - y^2)\n0 = x + ay(1 - x^2 - y^2)\n\nLet's solve the first equation for y:\n\ny = ax(1 - x^2 - y^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\n0 = x + a(ax(1 - x^2 - (ax(1 - x^2 - y^2))^2))(1 - x^2 - (ax(1 - x^2 - y^2))^2)\n\nThis is a complicated equation, but we can simplify it by considering some cases:\n\nCase 1: x = 0\nIf x = 0, the first equation becomes:\n\ny = 0\n\nSo, one fixed point is (0, 0).\n\nCase 2: x ≠ 0\nIf x ≠ 0, we can divide the second equation by x:\n\n0 = 1 + a^2y(1 - x^2 - y^2)\n\nNow, substitute the expression for y from the first equation:\n\n0 = 1 + a^2(ax(1 - x^2 - y^2))(1 - x^2 - (ax(1 - x^2 - y^2))^2)\n\nThis equation is still complicated, but we can find fixed points numerically for specific values of a.\n\nSo, in terms of a, we have one fixed point at the origin (0, 0), and potentially other fixed points depending on the value of a.\n\n2. With a value of a = 0.2, construct the Poincare map for the system by choosing a cross section at y = 0 and plot the resulting map.\n\nTo construct the Poincare map, we need to simulate the system numerically and record the values of x whenever y = 0. This requires using a numerical solver for the given differential equations, which is beyond the scope of this text-based platform. However, you can use software like MATLAB or Python to simulate the system and plot the Poincare map.\n\n3. Using the plot, determine whether the fixed point at the origin is stable or unstable.\n\nSince we cannot plot the Poincare map here, we cannot directly determine the stability of the fixed point at the origin. However, you can analyze the plot generated by the software you used in step 2 to determine the stability. If the points in the Poincare map converge to the origin, the fixed point is stable; if they diverge, the fixed point is unstable."
