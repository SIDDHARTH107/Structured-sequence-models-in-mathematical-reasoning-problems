    "message_2": "The Cartesian product A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B. Similarly, the Cartesian product B x A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is an element of B and a is an element of A.\n\nLet's find the elements of A x B:\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\n\nNow let's find the elements of B x A:\nB x A = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nNow, let's compare A x B and B x A:\nA x B = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}\nB x A = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}\n\nAs we can see, the elements of A x B and B x A are not the same, even though they have the same number of elements. The order of the elements in the ordered pairs is different, which makes the two sets not equal.\n\nTherefore, A x B â‰  B x A."
