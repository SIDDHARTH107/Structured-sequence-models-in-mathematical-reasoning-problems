    "message_2": "To find the total number of different meals that can be formed, we can use the counting principle. We multiply the number of choices for each part of the meal together.\n\nNumber of appetizers: 8\nNumber of main courses: 12\nNumber of desserts: 5\n\nTotal number of different meals = 8 appetizers × 12 main courses × 5 desserts = 480 different meals."
