    "message_2": "To prove the inequality, we will use the Morse inequalities and the Euler characteristic. Recall that the Euler characteristic of a connected graph is given by:\n\n$$\n\\chi(M) = v - e + f\n$$\n\nFor a closed surface of genus $g$, the Euler characteristic is given by:\n\n$$\n\\chi(S_g) = 2 - 2g\n$$\n\nNow, let's consider the manifold $M$ with genus $g$ and $k$ boundary components. We can obtain $M$ by cutting $k$ holes in the closed surface $S_g$. The Euler characteristic of $M$ is then:\n\n$$\n\\chi(M) = \\chi(S_g) - k = 2 - 2g - k\n$$\n\nBy the Morse inequalities, we have:\n\n$$\nb_i(M) \\geq \\sum^{i}_{j=0} (-1)^{i-j} \\binom{k-j}{i-j} b_{i-j}(S_g) \\text{   for all  } i\n$$\n\nNow, let's find the Betti numbers of $M$ if $g=3$, $k=4$, $v=12$, $e=18$, and $f=8$. First, we compute the Euler characteristic of $M$:\n\n$$\n\\chi(M) = 2 - 2g - k = 2 - 2(3) - 4 = -8\n$$\n\nSince $M$ is a 2-dimensional manifold, it has three Betti numbers: $b_0(M)$, $b_1(M)$, and $b_2(M)$. We know that $b_0(M) = 1$ because $M$ is connected. To find $b_1(M)$ and $b_2(M)$, we use the Euler characteristic:\n\n$$\n\\chi(M) = b_0(M) - b_1(M) + b_2(M)\n$$\n\nSubstituting the known values, we get:\n\n$$\n-8 = 1 - b_1(M) + b_2(M)\n$$\n\nNow, let's find the Betti numbers of the closed surface $S_g$ with genus $g=3$. For a closed surface, we have $b_0(S_g) = 1$, $b_1(S_g) = 2g$, and $b_2(S_g) = 1$. Thus, $b_1(S_g) = 6$ and $b_2(S_g) = 1$.\n\nUsing the Morse inequalities, we have:\n\n$$\nb_1(M) \\geq \\sum^{1}_{j=0} (-1)^{1-j} \\binom{4-j}{1-j} b_{1-j}(S_g) = 4b_0(S_g) - b_1(S_g) = 4(1) - 6 = -2\n$$\n\n$$\nb_2(M) \\geq \\sum^{2}_{j=0} (-1)^{2-j} \\binom{4-j}{2-j} b_{2-j}(S_g) = \\binom{4}{2}b_0(S_g) - 4b_1(S_g) + b_2(S_g) = 6(1) - 4(6) + 1 = -17\n$$\n\nSince Betti numbers are non-negative, we have $b_1(M) = 0$ and $b_2(M) = 0$. Therefore, the Betti numbers of $M$ are $b_0(M) = 1$, $b_1(M) = 0$, and $b_2(M) = 0$."
