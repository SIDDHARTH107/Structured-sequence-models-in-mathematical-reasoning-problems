    "message_1": "A hotel has 15 rooms. In how many ways can you assign four guests to the rooms if each room can only fit two guests, and each guest must share a room with one other guest?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula. Since there are 4 guests and they need to be paired up, there will be 2 pairs of guests. We need to find the number of ways to choose 2 rooms out of the 15 available rooms for these pairs.\n\nThe combination formula is: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 15 (total number of rooms) and k = 2 (number of rooms we need to choose for the pairs).\n\nC(15, 2) = 15! / (2!(15-2)!)\nC(15, 2) = 15! / (2! * 13!)\nC(15, 2) = (15 * 14 * 13!) / (2 * 13!)\nC(15, 2) = (15 * 14) / 2\nC(15, 2) = 105\n\nSo, there are 105 ways to choose 2 rooms out of the 15 available rooms for the pairs of guests."
