    "message_1": "A stream cipher uses a keystream generator that produces a sequence of bits to encrypt messages. Consider a keystream generator that uses a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to produce keystream bits. The LFSR has a feedback polynomial of x^4 + x + 1. If the initial state of the LFSR is 1101 and the first eight bits of the keystream are 11010010, what is the 9th bit of the keystream?",
    "message_2": "To find the 9th bit of the keystream, we need to perform the LFSR operation one more time. The feedback polynomial x^4 + x + 1 corresponds to the taps at positions 4 and 2 (counting from the right). \n\nThe initial state of the LFSR is 1101. We have the first eight bits of the keystream, so we can determine the next state of the LFSR for each bit:\n\n1. 1101 -> 1011 (XOR 1 and 0, shift left, insert 1)\n2. 1011 -> 0111 (XOR 1 and 1, shift left, insert 0)\n3. 0111 -> 1110 (XOR 1 and 0, shift left, insert 1)\n4. 1110 -> 1101 (XOR 1 and 1, shift left, insert 0)\n5. 1101 -> 1010 (XOR 1 and 0, shift left, insert 0)\n6. 1010 -> 0101 (XOR 1 and 0, shift left, insert 0)\n7. 0101 -> 1010 (XOR 0 and 1, shift left, insert 1)\n8. 1010 -> 0100 (XOR 1 and 0, shift left, insert 0)\n\nNow, we perform the LFSR operation one more time to find the 9th bit of the keystream:\n\n9. 0100 -> 1001 (XOR 0 and 0, shift left, insert 1)\n\nSo, the 9th bit of the keystream is 1."
