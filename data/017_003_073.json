    "message_2": "The cyclic group of order 7 is denoted by Z_7 or C_7. It consists of the integers {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} under addition modulo 7. The group is generated by a single element, usually denoted by g, such that every element in the group can be expressed as a power of g. In this case, g can be any integer from 1 to 6, as each of these generates the entire group under modular addition."
