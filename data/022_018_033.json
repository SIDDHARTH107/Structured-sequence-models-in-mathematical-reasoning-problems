    "message_1": "Consider the complex partial differential equation $u_{xx} + u_{yy} + 4u = 0$, where $u(x,y)$ is a complex-valued function of two variables. If $u(x,y) = e^{-2x}\\sin(2y)$ is a solution to the equation, find another solution that satisfies the same boundary conditions as $u(x,y)$.",
    "message_2": "To find another solution that satisfies the same boundary conditions as $u(x,y) = e^{-2x}\\sin(2y)$, we can use the method of complex conjugates. The complex conjugate of a complex number is the number with the same real part and the opposite imaginary part. In this case, the complex conjugate of the given solution is:\n\n$v(x,y) = e^{-2x}\\sin(-2y)$\n\nNow, let's check if this solution satisfies the given partial differential equation:\n\n$v_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} = 4e^{-2x}\\sin(-2y)$\n$v_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} = 4e^{-2x}\\sin(-2y)$\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n\n$v_{xx} + v_{yy} + 4v = 4e^{-2x}\\sin(-2y) + 4e^{-2x}\\sin(-2y) + 4e^{-2x}\\sin(-2y) = 0$\n\nThus, $v(x,y) = e^{-2x}\\sin(-2y)$ is also a solution to the given partial differential equation and satisfies the same boundary conditions as $u(x,y) = e^{-2x}\\sin(2y)$."
