    "message_1": "There are 3 different routes that can lead to the campus from Rachel's home. Route A takes 20 minutes on a normal day, Route B takes 15 minutes on a normal day, and Route C takes 25 minutes on a normal day. However, there is a chance that there might be traffic on Route A or Route B, increasing the travel time by 5 minutes. Rachel wants to take the shortest route possible but also wants to be on time for her class which starts in exactly 30 minutes. What is the probability that she will choose the right route and make it to the class on time?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze each route and the probability of Rachel arriving on time.\n\nRoute A: \n- If there is no traffic, Rachel will arrive in 20 minutes, which is on time.\n- If there is traffic, Rachel will arrive in 25 minutes, which is still on time.\n\nRoute B:\n- If there is no traffic, Rachel will arrive in 15 minutes, which is on time.\n- If there is traffic, Rachel will arrive in 20 minutes, which is still on time.\n\nRoute C:\n- Rachel will always arrive in 25 minutes, which is on time.\n\nSince all three routes can potentially get Rachel to class on time, we need to find the probability of her choosing the right route. Since there are 3 routes, the probability of choosing any one route is 1/3.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the probability of traffic affecting Routes A and B. Let's assume the probability of traffic on Route A is p(A) and on Route B is p(B). Then, the probability of no traffic on Route A is 1 - p(A) and on Route B is 1 - p(B).\n\nThe probability of Rachel choosing the right route and making it to class on time can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(Right Route & On Time) = P(Route A & On Time) + P(Route B & On Time) + P(Route C & On Time)\n\nP(Route A & On Time) = (1/3) * [p(A) + (1 - p(A))] = 1/3\nP(Route B & On Time) = (1/3) * [p(B) + (1 - p(B))] = 1/3\nP(Route C & On Time) = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3\n\nP(Right Route & On Time) = 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1\n\nSo, the probability that Rachel will choose the right route and make it to the class on time is 1, or 100%. This is because all three routes have a possibility of getting her to class on time, regardless of traffic."
