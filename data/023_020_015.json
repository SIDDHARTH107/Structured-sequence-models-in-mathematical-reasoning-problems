    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval -π < x < π, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since the function is even, we only need to find the a_n coefficients. The general formula for the Fourier series of an even function is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0 and a_n are the Fourier coefficients, given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nLet's find a_0 first:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3) * x^3](-π, π)\na_0 = (1/π) * [(1/3) * π^3 - (1/3) * (-π)^3]\na_0 = (1/π) * (2/3) * π^3\na_0 = (2/3) * π^2\n\nNow let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(n * x) dx\n\nSince the function is even, we can simplify the integral as follows:\n\na_n = (2/π) * ∫[0, π] x^2 * cos(n * x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts twice. Let u = x^2 and dv = cos(n * x) dx. Then du = 2x dx and v = (1/n) * sin(n * x).\n\nFirst integration by parts:\n\n∫ x^2 * cos(n * x) dx = (x^2 * (1/n) * sin(n * x)) - ∫ 2x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nNow, let u = 2x and dv = sin(n * x) dx. Then du = 2 dx and v = -(1/n) * cos(n * x).\n\nSecond integration by parts:\n\n∫ 2x * (1/n) * sin(n * x) dx = -2x * (1/n^2) * cos(n * x) + ∫ 2 * (1/n^2) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate the last term:\n\n∫ 2 * (1/n^2) * cos(n * x) dx = (2/n^3) * sin(n * x)\n\nNow, let's put everything together:\n\na_n = (2/π) * [(x^2 * (1/n) * sin(n * x) - (-2x * (1/n^2) * cos(n * x) + (2/n^3) * sin(n * x))](0, π)\na_n = (2/π) * [(π^2 * (1/n) * sin(n * π) - (-2π * (1/n^2) * cos(n * π) + (2/n^3) * sin(n * π)) - (0 - 0 + 0)]\na_n = (2/π) * [-2π * (1/n^2) * cos(n * π)]\n\nSince cos(n * π) = (-1)^n, we can rewrite a_n as:\n\na_n = (2/π) * (-2π * (1/n^2) * (-1)^n)\na_n = (-4 * (-1)^n * π) / n^2\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = x^2:\n\nf(x) = (2/3) * π^2 + Σ [(-4 * (-1)^n * π) / n^2 * cos(n * x)]\n\nThe first three nonzero terms of the series are:\n\nf(x) ≈ (2/3) * π^2 - (4π/1^2) * cos(x) + (4π/3^2) * cos(3x) - (4π/5^2) * cos(5x)"
