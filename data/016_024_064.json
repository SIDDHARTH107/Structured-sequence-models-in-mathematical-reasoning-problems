    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from the initial square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the central square is removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining 8 squares.\n\nLet's denote the total number of squares in the nth iteration as S(n). In the first iteration (n=1), there are 8 squares. In the second iteration (n=2), each of the 8 squares from the first iteration is divided into 9 smaller squares, and the central square is removed, resulting in 8 * (9 - 1) = 64 squares. In general, for the nth iteration, there are 8^n squares.\n\nFor the 7th iteration, the total number of squares is S(7) = 8^7 = 2,097,152.\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes that the initial carpet has a side length of 3 units. Since the given initial carpet has a side length of 27 units, which is 3^3 times larger, we need to consider the scaling factor. The number of squares in the scaled carpet will be the same as in the unscaled carpet, but each square will be 3^3 times larger. Therefore, the total number of squares in the 7th iteration of the Sierpinski carpet with a side length of 27 units is still 2,097,152."
