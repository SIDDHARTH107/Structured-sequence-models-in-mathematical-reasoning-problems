    "message_1": "In a particular neighborhood, there are 100 households. The probability of a car being stolen from a household is 0.05. What is the probability that at least 5 households will have their cars stolen in the next month?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 5 households will have their cars stolen, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability of the opposite event occurring. In this case, the opposite event is that 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 households have their cars stolen. We can calculate this probability and then subtract it from 1 to find the probability of at least 5 households having their cars stolen.\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula for this problem:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of households, k is the number of households with stolen cars, p is the probability of a car being stolen, and (n choose k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 households having their cars stolen:\n\nP(X = 0) = (100 choose 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0)\nP(X = 1) = (100 choose 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1)\nP(X = 2) = (100 choose 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2)\nP(X = 3) = (100 choose 3) * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(100-3)\nP(X = 4) = (100 choose 4) * 0.05^4 * (1-0.05)^(100-4)\n\nNow, we can calculate the complementary probability:\n\nP(X < 5) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least 5 households having their cars stolen:\n\nP(X ≥ 5) = 1 - P(X < 5)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.006\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.031\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.081\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.139\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.178\n\nP(X < 5) ≈ 0.006 + 0.031 + 0.081 + 0.139 + 0.178 ≈ 0.435\n\nP(X ≥ 5) ≈ 1 - 0.435 ≈ 0.565\n\nSo, the probability that at least 5 households will have their cars stolen in the next month is approximately 0.565 or 56.5%."
