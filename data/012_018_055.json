    "message_2": "To disconnect a complete graph with 7 vertices, we need to remove all the edges connected to at least one vertex. In a complete graph, each vertex is connected to every other vertex. So, for a graph with 7 vertices, each vertex has 6 edges connected to it.\n\nHowever, we don't need to remove all the edges connected to every vertex, as removing the edges connected to just one vertex will be enough to disconnect the graph. So, the minimum number of edges that must be removed to disconnect a complete graph with 7 vertices is 6."
