    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it is not possible to create a numerical problem based on deontic logic as it is a branch of logic that deals with norms and permissions, not with numerical calculations. Deontic logic focuses on expressing statements such as what is mandatory, permitted, or forbidden in a given situation. It is used to reason about ethical or legal reasoning, rather than numerical calculations.",
