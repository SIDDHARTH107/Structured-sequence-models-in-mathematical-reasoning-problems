    "message_2": "The Mandelbrot set is a fractal, and its area is not well-defined when zoomed in at specific coordinates. The area of the Mandelbrot set is known to be less than 2, but the exact value is not known. When zooming in on specific coordinates, the fractal nature of the set means that its boundary becomes increasingly complex, and the area cannot be calculated in a straightforward manner.\n\nHowever, if you are interested in the area of a rectangular region around the given coordinates with a zoom factor of 10^(-7), we can calculate that.\n\nLet's assume the rectangular region has a width and height of 10^(-7) units. Then, the area of the rectangular region would be:\n\nArea = width * height = (10^(-7)) * (10^(-7)) = 10^(-14) square units.\n\nPlease note that this area calculation is for the rectangular region around the given coordinates and not for the Mandelbrot set itself."
