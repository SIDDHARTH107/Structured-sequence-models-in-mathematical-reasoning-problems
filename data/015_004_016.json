    "message_2": "The main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is the region in the complex plane that is connected to the origin and has a heart-like shape. It is defined by the equation:\n\nr = 1 - cos(θ)\n\nwhere r is the distance from the origin to the boundary of the cardioid, and θ is the angle between the positive real axis and the line connecting the origin to the boundary.\n\nTo find the area of the main cardioid, we can use polar coordinates and integrate over the region:\n\nArea = ∫(1/2)r^2 dθ\n\nWe integrate over the range of θ from 0 to 2π:\n\nArea = ∫(1/2)(1 - cos(θ))^2 dθ, from 0 to 2π\n\nTo simplify the integral, we can expand the square:\n\nArea = (1/2)∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + cos^2(θ)) dθ\n\nNow, we can use the double-angle identity for cosine:\n\ncos^2(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2\n\nSubstitute this into the integral:\n\nArea = (1/2)∫(1 - 2cos(θ) + (1 + cos(2θ))/2) dθ\n\nArea = (1/2)∫(2 - 2cos(θ) + 1 + cos(2θ)) dθ\n\nArea = (1/2)∫(3 - 2cos(θ) + cos(2θ)) dθ\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\nArea = (1/2)[3θ - 2sin(θ) + (1/2)sin(2θ)] from 0 to 2π\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nArea = (1/2)[3(2π) - 2sin(2π) + (1/2)sin(4π)] - (1/2)[3(0) - 2sin(0) + (1/2)sin(0)]\n\nArea = (1/2)[6π]\n\nArea = 3π\n\nSo, the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is 3π square units."
