    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 96 and 208 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (208) by the smaller number (96) and find the remainder.\n   208 รท 96 = 2 with a remainder of 16.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (208) with the smaller number (96), and the smaller number with the remainder (16).\n\n3. Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.\n\n   96 รท 16 = 6 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 16. So, the GCD of 96 and 208 is 16."
