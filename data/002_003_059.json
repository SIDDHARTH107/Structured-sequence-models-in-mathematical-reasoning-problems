    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and the surface area of a cube is given by the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 6 * (side length)^2\n\nWe are given the surface area as 150 square centimeters. So,\n\n150 = 6 * (side length)^2\n\nTo find the side length, we can first divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\n150 / 6 = (side length)^2\n25 = (side length)^2\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides to find the side length:\n\nside length = âˆš25\nside length = 5\n\nSo, the length of one side of the cube is 5 centimeters."
