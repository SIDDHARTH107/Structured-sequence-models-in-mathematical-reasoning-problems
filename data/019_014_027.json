    "message_2": "To prove the statement \"For all k natural numbers, there exists a prime number larger than k\" using higher-order logic, we can use a proof by contradiction.\n\nAssume the opposite of the statement: There exists a natural number k such that there is no prime number larger than k.\n\nLet S be the set of all prime numbers less than or equal to k: S = {p_1, p_2, ..., p_n}, where p_i are prime numbers and n is the total number of prime numbers in S.\n\nNow, consider the number M = (p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n) + 1. M is the product of all prime numbers in S plus 1.\n\nNotice that M is greater than all prime numbers in S, since it is the product of all of them plus 1.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1. M is a prime number. In this case, M is a prime number larger than k, which contradicts our initial assumption.\n\n2. M is not a prime number. In this case, M must have a prime factorization. Let q be the smallest prime factor of M. Since M is not divisible by any prime numbers in S (because the remainder is always 1), q must be a prime number larger than k. This also contradicts our initial assumption.\n\nIn both cases, we have a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption is false, and the statement \"For all k natural numbers, there exists a prime number larger than k\" is true."
