    "message_1": "A manufacturing company claims that the mean weight of their cereal boxes is 16 ounces. A sample of 40 boxes has been taken and it is found that the mean weight of the boxes is 15.5 ounces with a standard deviation of 0.4 ounces. Can we reject the company's claim at a 5% significance level?",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the mean weight of the cereal boxes is 16 ounces, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the mean weight is not 16 ounces.\n\nH0: μ = 16\nH1: μ ≠ 16\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- Sample size (n) = 40\n- Sample mean (x̄) = 15.5 ounces\n- Sample standard deviation (s) = 0.4 ounces\n- Significance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nt = (15.5 - 16) / (0.4 / √40)\nt = (-0.5) / (0.4 / 6.325)\nt = -0.5 / 0.06325\nt ≈ -7.905\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with a 5% significance level and 39 degrees of freedom (n-1 = 40-1 = 39). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value:\n\nt_critical ≈ ±2.023\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-7.905) is less than the lower critical t-value (-2.023), we reject the null hypothesis. There is enough evidence to suggest that the mean weight of the cereal boxes is not 16 ounces at a 5% significance level."
