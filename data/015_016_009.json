    "message_2": "To find the steady-state voltages across each capacitor and the current through the inductor in a Chua circuit, we need to analyze the circuit equations. The Chua circuit consists of a nonlinear resistor (Chua's diode), a capacitor C1, an inductor L, and a capacitor C2.\n\nThe governing equations for the Chua circuit are as follows:\n\n1. C1 * dV1/dt = -(V1 - V2) / R - I(V1)\n2. C2 * dV2/dt = (V1 - V2) / R + IL\n3. L * dIL/dt = -V2\n\nWhere V1 and V2 are the voltages across capacitors C1 and C2, respectively, IL is the current through the inductor L, R is the resistance, and I(V1) is the current through Chua's diode, which is given by:\n\nI(V1) = m0 * V1 + 0.5 * (m1 - m0) * (|V1 + β| - |V1 - β|)\n\nIn steady-state conditions, the time derivatives dV1/dt, dV2/dt, and dIL/dt are all zero. Therefore, the governing equations become:\n\n1. 0 = -(V1 - V2) / R - I(V1)\n2. 0 = (V1 - V2) / R + IL\n3. 0 = -V2\n\nFrom equation 3, we can see that the steady-state voltage across capacitor C2 (V2) is 0V.\n\nNow, we can substitute V2 = 0 into equations 1 and 2:\n\n1. 0 = -V1 / R - I(V1)\n2. 0 = V1 / R + IL\n\nFrom equation 2, we have IL = -V1 / R.\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for IL into the Chua's diode current equation:\n\nI(V1) = m0 * V1 + 0.5 * (m1 - m0) * (|V1 + β| - |V1 - β|) = -V1 / R\n\nUsing the given values for m0, m1, and β:\n\nI(V1) = (-1/7) * V1 + 0.5 * (2/7 + 1/7) * (|V1 + 28| - |V1 - 28|) = -V1 / R\n\nSolving this equation for V1 is a bit tricky due to the absolute value terms. However, since we are looking for the steady-state solution, we can assume that the circuit has settled into a stable oscillation. In this case, the term (|V1 + 28| - |V1 - 28|) will oscillate between positive and negative values, averaging out to zero over time. Therefore, we can approximate the equation as:\n\n(-1/7) * V1 = -V1 / R\n\nNow, we can solve for V1:\n\nV1 = 7 * R\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot determine the exact value of V1 without knowing the value of R. However, we can conclude that the steady-state voltage across capacitor C1 (V1) is 7 times the resistance R.\n\nFinally, we can find the steady-state current through the inductor (IL) using the expression IL = -V1 / R:\n\nIL = -7 * R / R = -7A\n\nIn summary, the steady-state voltages across capacitors C1 and C2 are 7 * R V and 0V, respectively, and the steady-state current through the inductor is -7A."
