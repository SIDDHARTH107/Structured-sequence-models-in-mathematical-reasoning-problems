    "message_2": "To find all solutions in the interval [0, 2π) for the equation tan x - 1 = 0, we first need to rewrite the equation as:\n\ntan x = 1\n\nNow, we need to find all angles x in the interval [0, 2π) for which the tangent function equals 1.\n\nRecall that the tangent function has a period of π, which means that if tan x = 1, then tan(x + nπ) = 1 for any integer n. Therefore, we only need to find the solutions for x in the interval [0, π) and then add multiples of π to find all solutions in the interval [0, 2π).\n\nThe tangent function is equal to 1 at x = π/4, so the first solution is x = π/4.\n\nSince the tangent function has a period of π, we can add π to the first solution to find the second solution:\n\nx = π/4 + π = 5π/4\n\nNow we have found all solutions in the interval [0, 2π):\n\nx = π/4, 5π/4"
