    "message_2": "First, let's write down the coefficient matrix and the constant matrix:\n\nA = | 3  2  1 |\n    | 6 -3  2 |\n    | 1  1  4 |\n\nb = | 14 |\n    |  6 |\n    |  8 |\n\nNow, let's convert the coefficient matrix A to a sparse matrix representation. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, our matrix A doesn't have any zero elements, so it's not considered sparse. However, we can still represent it using a sparse matrix data structure, such as the Coordinate List (COO) format.\n\nIn the COO format, we store a list of (row, column, value) tuples for each non-zero element in the matrix. For matrix A, the COO representation would be:\n\nA_COO = [(0, 0, 3), (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1),\n         (1, 0, 6), (1, 1, -3), (1, 2, 2),\n         (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 1), (2, 2, 4)]\n\nSince the matrix A is not sparse, using a sparse matrix method to solve the system of linear equations would not be efficient. Instead, we can use a standard method like Gaussian elimination or the LU decomposition to solve the system.\n\nLet's use Gaussian elimination to solve the system:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 3 to make the first element 1:\n\n   A = | 1   2/3  1/3 |\n       | 6  -3    2  |\n       | 1   1    4  |\n\n   b = | 14/3 |\n       |  6   |\n       |  8   |\n\n2. Subtract 6 times the first row from the second row and subtract the first row from the third row to make the second and third elements in the first column 0:\n\n   A = | 1   2/3  1/3 |\n       | 0  -7    0  |\n       | 0   1/3 11/3|\n\n   b = | 14/3 |\n       | -20/3|\n       |  22/3|\n\n3. Divide the second row by -7 to make the second element in the second column 1:\n\n   A = | 1   2/3  1/3  |\n       | 0   1   -0   |\n       | 0   1/3 11/3 |\n\n   b = | 14/3 |\n       | 20/7 |\n       | 22/3 |\n\n4. Subtract 1/3 times the second row from the third row to make the third element in the second column 0:\n\n   A = | 1   2/3  1/3  |\n       | 0   1    0   |\n       | 0   0   11/3 |\n\n   b = | 14/3 |\n       | 20/7 |\n       |  6  |\n\n5. Divide the third row by 11/3 to make the third element in the third column 1:\n\n   A = | 1  2/3  1/3 |\n       | 0   1    0  |\n       | 0   0    1  |\n\n   b = | 14/3 |\n       | 20/7 |\n       |  2  |\n\n6. Substitute the values back into the original equations to find the solution:\n\n   x = 14/3 - 2/3 * (20/7) - 1/3 * 2 = 2\n   y = 20/7 = 2.857\n   z = 2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 2\ny â‰ˆ 2.857\nz = 2"
