    "message_2": "First, let's find A x B, which is the Cartesian product of A and B. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA x B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A x B, denoted as (A x B)'. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) that are not in A x B. Since we are not given a universal set, we cannot find the exact elements of (A x B)'.\n\nNext, let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B'. Again, since we are not given a universal set, we cannot find the exact elements of A' and B'.\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A' and B', denoted as A' x B'. This is the set of all ordered pairs (a', b') where a' is in A' and b' is in B'. Since we do not know the exact elements of A' and B', we cannot find the exact elements of A' x B'.\n\nHowever, we can still show that (A x B)' is not equal to A' x B' by using a counterexample. Suppose there exists an ordered pair (a, b) in (A x B)'. This means that (a, b) is not in A x B, so a is not in A and b is not in B. Therefore, a is in A' and b is in B', so (a, b) is in A' x B'.\n\nNow, suppose there exists an ordered pair (a', b') in A' x B'. This means that a' is in A' and b' is in B', so a' is not in A and b' is not in B. Therefore, (a', b') is not in A x B, so (a', b') is in (A x B)'.\n\nThis shows that if an ordered pair is in (A x B)', it is also in A' x B', and vice versa. However, this does not mean that (A x B)' is equal to A' x B', because we have not considered all possible ordered pairs in the universal set. There may be other ordered pairs that are not in (A x B)' but are in A' x B', or vice versa. Without knowing the universal set, we cannot conclude that (A x B)' is equal to A' x B'."
