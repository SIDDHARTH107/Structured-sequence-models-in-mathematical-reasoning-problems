    "message_2": "To find out how fast the area of the oil spill is increasing, we need to find the rate of change of the area with respect to time. We are given the rate of change of the radius with respect to time, which is 4 cm per minute.\n\nLet A be the area of the oil spill and r be its radius. We know that A = πr^2. We want to find dA/dt, the rate of change of the area with respect to time.\n\nFirst, we differentiate both sides of the equation A = πr^2 with respect to time t:\n\ndA/dt = d(πr^2)/dt\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\ndA/dt = 2πr(dr/dt)\n\nWe are given that dr/dt = 4 cm/min and we want to find dA/dt when r = 8 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\ndA/dt = 2π(8)(4)\n\ndA/dt = 64π cm²/min\n\nSo, the area of the oil spill is increasing at a rate of 64π cm² per minute when the radius is 8 cm."
