    "message_1": "Given the following context:\n\nLinear logic is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with resources and their usage. In linear logic, propositions are treated as resources that may be consumed during the course of a proof. \n\nQuestion for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you have five resources of type A and six resources of type B. How many ways can you use all of your resources in a linear logic proof, where propositions of type A can only be used once and propositions of type B can be used twice?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways we can use the resources of type A and type B in a linear logic proof.\n\nWe have 5 resources of type A, and each can be used only once. Therefore, there are 5! (5 factorial) ways to use these resources, which is equal to 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 ways.\n\nFor the 6 resources of type B, each can be used twice. So, we have a total of 12 uses of type B resources. We need to find the number of ways to arrange these 12 uses. Since each resource can be used twice, we have a repetition of 2 for each resource. To find the number of ways to arrange these resources, we can use the formula for permutations with repetition:\n\nn! / (r1! × r2! × ... × rk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of uses, and r1, r2, ..., rk are the repetitions for each resource.\n\nIn our case, n = 12 (total uses of type B resources) and r1 = r2 = ... = r6 = 2 (each resource can be used twice).\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange type B resources is:\n\n12! / (2! × 2! × 2! × 2! × 2! × 2!) = 12! / (2^6) = 479001600 / 64 = 7484400 ways.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to use both type A and type B resources in a linear logic proof. Since the usage of type A and type B resources is independent, we can simply multiply the number of ways for each type:\n\nTotal ways = Ways to use type A resources × Ways to use type B resources\nTotal ways = 120 × 7484400 = 898128000 ways.\n\nSo, there are 898128000 ways to use all of your resources in a linear logic proof, where propositions of type A can only be used once and propositions of type B can be used twice."
