    "message_2": "To approximate the second derivative of $f(x)$ at $x = 2$ using the central difference method with a step size $h = 0.1$, we first need to compute the values of $f(x)$ at $x = 2 - h$, $x = 2$, and $x = 2 + h$. \n\nLet's calculate these values:\n\n$f(2 - 0.1) = f(1.9) = (1.9)^3 - 2(1.9)^2 + 3(1.9) - 4 = -0.289$\n$f(2) = (2)^3 - 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 4 = 0$\n$f(2 + 0.1) = f(2.1) = (2.1)^3 - 2(2.1)^2 + 3(2.1) - 4 = 0.261$\n\nNow, we can use the central difference formula for the second derivative:\n\n$f''(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2}$\n\nPlugging in the values we calculated:\n\n$f''(2) \\approx \\frac{f(2.1) - 2f(2) + f(1.9)}{(0.1)^2} = \\frac{0.261 - 2(0) + (-0.289)}{0.01} = \\frac{-0.028}{0.01} = -2.8$\n\nSo, the approximation for the second derivative of $f(x)$ at $x = 2$ using the central difference method with a step size $h = 0.1$ is $-2.8$."
