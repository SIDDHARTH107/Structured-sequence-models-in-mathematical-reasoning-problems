Using Liouville's theorem, prove that $f(z)$ is a constant function. \n\nThen, apply the fundamental theorem of algebra to prove that if $p(z)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ with complex coefficients, then $p(z)$ has exactly $n$ roots counting multiplicity. Using this result, find the number of complex roots of the polynomial $p(z) = z^4 + 5z^3 - 12z^2 - 22z + 24$.",
    "message_2": "To prove that $f(z)$ is a constant function using Liouville's theorem, we first need to recall the statement of Liouville's theorem:\n\nLiouville's Theorem: If a function $f(z)$ is entire (holomorphic on the entire complex plane) and bounded, then $f(z)$ is a constant function.\n\nNow, we are given that $f(z)$ is entire and satisfies $|f(z)|\\leq 10$ for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$. This means that $f(z)$ is a bounded entire function. By Liouville's theorem, we can conclude that $f(z)$ is a constant function.\n\nNext, we apply the fundamental theorem of algebra to prove that if $p(z)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ with complex coefficients, then $p(z)$ has exactly $n$ roots counting multiplicity.\n\nFundamental Theorem of Algebra: Every non-constant polynomial $p(z)$ of degree $n$ with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.\n\nUsing induction, we can prove that a polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ roots counting multiplicity. For the base case, let $n=1$. A linear polynomial has exactly one root, which satisfies the theorem. Now, assume that the theorem holds for polynomials of degree $k$. Let $p(z)$ be a polynomial of degree $k+1$. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, $p(z)$ has at least one complex root, say $z_1$. We can then factor out $(z-z_1)$ from $p(z)$, obtaining a polynomial of degree $k$. By the induction hypothesis, this polynomial has exactly $k$ roots counting multiplicity. Therefore, $p(z)$ has exactly $k+1$ roots counting multiplicity.\n\nNow, let's find the number of complex roots of the polynomial $p(z) = z^4 + 5z^3 - 12z^2 - 22z + 24$. Since the polynomial has degree 4, by the fundamental theorem of algebra and the result we just proved, it has exactly 4 complex roots counting multiplicity."
