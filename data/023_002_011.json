    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nWe can find the coefficients using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1 / (2 * π)) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\n\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\nb_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x^2 is an even function, all b_n coefficients will be zero. Now we need to find a_0 and a_n.\n\na_0 = (1 / (2 * π)) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx = (1 / (2 * π)) * [(x^3 / 3)|(-π, π)] = (π^2 / 3)\n\na_n = (1 / π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(n * x) dx\n     = (1 / π) * [(2 * x * sin(n * x) / (n^2) - (x^2 * cos(n * x)) / n + (2 * cos(n * x)) / (n^3))|(-π, π)]\n\nAfter evaluating the integral, we get:\n\na_n = (4 * (-1)^n) / (n^2)\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = (π^2 / 3) + Σ [(4 * (-1)^n) / (n^2) * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nNow, let's determine the convergence of the series. Since f(x) = x^2 is continuous and has continuous derivatives of all orders on the interval [-π, π], the Fourier series converges pointwise to f(x) on this interval.\n\nHowever, the convergence is not uniform because the function f(x) = x^2 is unbounded as x approaches ±π, and the partial sums of the Fourier series are bounded functions. Therefore, the Fourier series converges pointwise but not uniformly on the interval [-π, π]."
