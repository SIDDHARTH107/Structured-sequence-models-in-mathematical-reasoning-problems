    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 4sin(2x) in the interval [0, π/2], we need to find the critical points of the function in the given interval and then evaluate the function at those points.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(4sin(2x))/dx = 4 * d(sin(2x))/dx\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 4 * cos(2x) * d(2x)/dx = 4 * cos(2x) * 2 = 8cos(2x)\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n8cos(2x) = 0\n\ncos(2x) = 0\n\n2x = π/2, 3π/2 (since cos(x) is 0 at odd multiples of π/2)\n\nx = π/4, 3π/4\n\nHowever, the second critical point, x = 3π/4, is not in the given interval [0, π/2]. Therefore, we only need to consider the critical point x = π/4.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(0) = 4sin(2*0) = 4sin(0) = 0\nf(π/4) = 4sin(2*(π/4)) = 4sin(π/2) = 4*1 = 4\nf(π/2) = 4sin(2*(π/2)) = 4sin(π) = 0\n\nThe maximum value of the function f(x) = 4sin(2x) in the interval [0, π/2] is 4, which occurs at x = π/4."
