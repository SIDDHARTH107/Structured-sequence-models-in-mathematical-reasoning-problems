    "message_2": "In a paraconsistent logic system, the expression (A=B) ∧ ¬(A=C) can be evaluated as follows:\n\nFirst, we need to determine the truth values of the individual statements (A=B) and ¬(A=C).\n\n1. (A=B): Since A=5 and B=7, A is not equal to B. Therefore, (A=B) is false.\n\n2. (A=C): Since A=5 and C=5, A is equal to C. Therefore, (A=C) is true.\n\nNow, we need to negate the truth value of (A=C):\n\n3. ¬(A=C): Since (A=C) is true, ¬(A=C) is false.\n\nFinally, we need to evaluate the conjunction (AND) of the two statements:\n\n4. (A=B) ∧ ¬(A=C): Since (A=B) is false and ¬(A=C) is false, the conjunction of the two statements is also false.\n\nSo, the result of the expression (A=B) ∧ ¬(A=C) in a paraconsistent logic system is false."
