    "message_1": "Consider the 3-sphere $S^3$ represented as the set of points in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ with norm 1. Determine the Hopf map $h:S^3 \\rightarrow S^2$ given by $h(x,y,z,w)=(2xy+2zw,2xz-2yw,x^2+y^2-z^2-w^2)$, where $S^2$ is the standard 2-sphere. Find the preimage of the point $(0,0,1) \\in S^2$ under this Hopf map.",
    "message_2": "To find the preimage of the point $(0,0,1) \\in S^2$ under the Hopf map $h$, we need to find all points $(x,y,z,w) \\in S^3$ such that $h(x,y,z,w) = (0,0,1)$. This means we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n1. $2xy + 2zw = 0$\n2. $2xz - 2yw = 0$\n3. $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - w^2 = 1$\n\nSince $(x,y,z,w) \\in S^3$, we also have the equation:\n\n4. $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1$\n\nFrom equations (1) and (2), we can rewrite them as:\n\n1'. $xy = -zw$\n2'. $xz = yw$\n\nNow, let's square both sides of equations (1') and (2') and add them together:\n\n$(xy)^2 + (xz)^2 = (-zw)^2 + (yw)^2$\n\nExpanding and rearranging, we get:\n\n$x^2(y^2 + z^2) = w^2(y^2 + z^2)$\n\nSince $y^2 + z^2 \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $(y^2 + z^2)$:\n\n$x^2 = w^2$\n\nNow, let's use equation (4) to rewrite this as:\n\n$y^2 + z^2 = 1 - x^2 = 1 - w^2$\n\nNow, let's square both sides of equation (3) and use equation (4) to simplify:\n\n$(x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - w^2)^2 = 1^2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$4x^2z^2 + 4y^2w^2 = 0$\n\nSince $x^2 = w^2$, we can rewrite this as:\n\n$4x^2(z^2 + y^2) = 0$\n\nSince $x^2 \\neq 0$, we must have:\n\n$z^2 + y^2 = 0$\n\nBut this is a contradiction, as we previously found that $y^2 + z^2 = 1 - x^2 = 1 - w^2 > 0$. Therefore, there is no preimage of the point $(0,0,1) \\in S^2$ under the Hopf map $h$."
