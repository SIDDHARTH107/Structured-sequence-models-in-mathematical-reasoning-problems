    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Vicsek fractal with a construction parameter of 4, we have:\n\n- N = 5, as there are 5 smaller squares in each iteration (one in the center and four in the corners).\n- s = 4, as the construction parameter is given as 4.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(5) / log(4)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.160964\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with a construction parameter of 4 is approximately 1.160964."
