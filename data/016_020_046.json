    "message_2": "A Sierpinski tetrahedron is created by iteratively subdividing a regular tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra, removing the central one, and repeating the process on the remaining three tetrahedra. After each iteration, the number of triangles on the surface increases.\n\nLet's calculate the number of triangles on the surface after each iteration:\n\nIteration 0 (initial tetrahedron): 4 triangles (base case)\n\nIteration 1: Each of the 4 triangles is replaced by 3 smaller triangles, so there are 4 * 3 = 12 triangles.\n\nIteration 2: Each of the 12 triangles is replaced by 3 smaller triangles, so there are 12 * 3 = 36 triangles.\n\nIteration 3: Each of the 36 triangles is replaced by 3 smaller triangles, so there are 36 * 3 = 108 triangles.\n\nIteration 4: Each of the 108 triangles is replaced by 3 smaller triangles, so there are 108 * 3 = 324 triangles.\n\nSo, after 4 iterations, there will be 324 triangles on the surface of the resulting Sierpinski tetrahedron."
