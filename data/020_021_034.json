    "message_1": "A factory can produce two types of products, type A and type B. Each unit of type A requires 5 hours of production time and each unit of type B requires 8 hours of production time. The factory has 80 hours of production time available each week. Each unit of type A generates a profit of $100 and each unit of type B generates a profit of $150. The factory wants to maximize its profit. How many units of each product should the factory produce per week?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of type A produced per week, and y be the number of units of type B produced per week. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 100x + 150y, subject to the constraint that 5x + 8y ≤ 80 (since the factory has 80 hours of production time available each week).\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by solving the inequality for y:\n\n5x + 8y ≤ 80\n8y ≤ -5x + 80\ny ≤ (-5/8)x + 10\n\nThe feasible region is the set of all points (x, y) such that y ≤ (-5/8)x + 10, x ≥ 0, and y ≥ 0.\n\nNow, we will find the vertices of the feasible region by finding the points where the boundary lines intersect:\n\n1. Intersection of y = (-5/8)x + 10 and x = 0:\ny = (-5/8)(0) + 10\ny = 10\nSo, the first vertex is (0, 10).\n\n2. Intersection of y = (-5/8)x + 10 and y = 0:\n0 = (-5/8)x + 10\n(5/8)x = 10\nx = 16\nSo, the second vertex is (16, 0).\n\n3. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0:\nThe third vertex is the origin (0, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 100x + 150y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 10) = 100(0) + 150(10) = $1500\n2. P(16, 0) = 100(16) + 150(0) = $1600\n3. P(0, 0) = 100(0) + 150(0) = $0\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (16, 0), with a profit of $1600. Therefore, the factory should produce 16 units of type A and 0 units of type B per week to maximize its profit."
