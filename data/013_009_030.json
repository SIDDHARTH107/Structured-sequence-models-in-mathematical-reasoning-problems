    "message_1": "Two players, A and B, are playing the Matching Pennies game, where each player chooses either \"heads\" or \"tails\" simultaneously. If they match, player A wins $1 from player B. If they don't match, player B wins $1 from player A. Suppose that player A plays \"heads\" with probability p and player B plays \"heads\" with probability q. \n\nWhat value of p should player A choose to maximize their expected winnings if player B always chooses \"heads\"?",
    "message_2": "If player B always chooses \"heads,\" that means q = 1. To maximize their expected winnings, player A should also choose \"heads\" every time to match player B's choice. Therefore, the value of p should be 1."
