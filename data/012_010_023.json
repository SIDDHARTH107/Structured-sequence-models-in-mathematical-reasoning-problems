    "message_2": "A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible vertex cover.\n\nTo find the minimum vertex cover of G, we can use a greedy algorithm. We start with an empty set and iteratively add vertices to the set that cover the most uncovered edges until all edges are covered.\n\n1. Start with an empty set: {}\n2. Add vertex 2, which covers edges (1,2), (2,3), and (2,5): {2}\n3. Add vertex 5, which covers edges (4,5) and (5,6): {2, 5}\n4. Add vertex 1, which covers the remaining edge (1,4): {1, 2, 5}\n\nNow all edges are covered, and the minimum vertex cover of G is {1, 2, 5}."
