    "message_2": "To determine if the system is stable using Fourier transform analysis, we first need to take the Fourier transform of the given differential equation. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is denoted by F(ω) and is defined as:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nwhere j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1) and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the given differential equation:\n\nFourier{dy/dt + 4y} = Fourier{cos(2t)}\n\nUsing the linearity property of the Fourier transform, we can write:\n\nFourier{dy/dt} + 4*Fourier{y} = Fourier{cos(2t)}\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of each term:\n\n1. Fourier{dy/dt}:\nThe Fourier transform of the derivative of a function is given by:\nFourier{dy/dt} = jωY(ω)\n\n2. Fourier{y}:\nWe denote the Fourier transform of y(t) as Y(ω).\n\n3. Fourier{cos(2t)}:\nThe Fourier transform of cos(2t) is given by:\nFourier{cos(2t)} = (π/2)[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)]\n\nwhere δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, substituting these results back into the equation:\n\njωY(ω) + 4Y(ω) = (π/2)[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)]\n\nNow, we can solve for Y(ω):\n\nY(ω) = (π/2)[δ(ω - 2) + δ(ω + 2)] / (jω + 4)\n\nTo determine the stability of the system, we need to analyze the poles of the transfer function Y(ω). The poles are the values of ω for which the denominator becomes zero:\n\njω + 4 = 0\nω = -4j\n\nSince the pole has a negative imaginary part and no real part, the system is stable. In general, a system is stable if all its poles have negative real parts. In this case, there is only one pole, and it has no real part, so the system is stable."
