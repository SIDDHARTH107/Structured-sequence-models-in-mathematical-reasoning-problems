Suppose that the initial intensity distribution is given by\n\nu(x,0) = x(1-x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n\nFind the intensity distribution u(x,t) at time t = 0.5.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nPlugging this into the PDE, we get:\n\nX(x)T'(t) = 2X''(x)T(t)\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by 2XT:\n\nT'(t) / (2T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ²:\n\nT'(t) / (2T(t)) = X''(x) / X(x) = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to solve:\n\n1) X''(x) = -λ²X(x)\n2) T'(t) = -2λ²T(t)\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get the general solution:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nSince u(x,0) = x(1-x), we have X(x) = x(1-x) when t=0. Applying the boundary conditions X(0) = 0 and X(1) = 0, we get:\n\nA = 0 and B*sin(λ) = 0\n\nSince B = 0 would give a trivial solution, we consider sin(λ) = 0, which implies λ = nπ for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThus, X_n(x) = B_n*sin(nπx)\n\nNow, solving the second ODE, we get the general solution:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-2λ²t)\n\nSo, the product solution is:\n\nu_n(x,t) = B_n*sin(nπx)*exp(-2(nπ)²t)\n\nNow, we can use the principle of superposition to obtain the general solution:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ B_n*sin(nπx)*exp(-2(nπ)²t)\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n, we use the initial condition u(x,0) = x(1-x):\n\nx(1-x) = Σ B_n*sin(nπx)\n\nWe can find B_n using the Fourier sine series:\n\nB_n = 2 * ∫[0,1] x(1-x) * sin(nπx) dx\n\nCalculating the integral, we get:\n\nB_n = 2 * [(-1)^n - 1] / (nπ)²\n\nNow, we have the intensity distribution u(x,t) at any time t:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [2 * ((-1)^n - 1) / (nπ)²] * sin(nπx) * exp(-2(nπ)²t)\n\nFinally, we can find the intensity distribution at time t = 0.5:\n\nu(x,0.5) = Σ [2 * ((-1)^n - 1) / (nπ)²] * sin(nπx) * exp(-2(nπ)²*0.5)\n\nThis is the intensity distribution u(x,t) at time t = 0.5."
