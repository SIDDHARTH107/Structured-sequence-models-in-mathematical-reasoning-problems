    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the given function, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. The general form of a Fourier series is:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFor a function with period 2π, the Fourier coefficients are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x for -π < x < π, we can compute the coefficients as follows:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x dx = 0 (due to the symmetry of the function around the origin)\n\nFor a_n, we have:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(nx) dx\n\nThis integral is also 0 due to the symmetry of the function.\n\nNow, we compute b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\n\nWe will use integration by parts to compute this integral. Let u = x and dv = sin(nx) dx. Then, du = dx and v = (-1/n) * cos(nx).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) | (-π, π) - ∫[-π, π] (-1/n) * cos(nx) dx]\n\nThe first term in the brackets evaluates to 0 due to the symmetry of the function. The second term is:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * (1/n) * ∫[-π, π] cos(nx) dx\n\nThis integral is also 0 for all n except when n is an odd integer. For odd n, we can use the property of sine function:\n\nsin(kπ) = 0 for all integer k\n\nSo, b_n = 0 for even n and b_n = (2/πn) for odd n.\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2/πn) * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all odd integers n."
