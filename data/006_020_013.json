    "message_1": "In a certain community, there are 100 households. Suppose that the probability of a household hosting a block party during the summer is 0.3. What is the probability that at least 25 households will host a block party during the summer?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 25 households will host a block party during the summer, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (in this case, households hosting a block party) out of n trials (households)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.3)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100 households)\n- k is the number of successes we are interested in (in this case, at least 25 households)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 25 households hosting a block party, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 25, 26, ..., 100. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = P(X = 25) + P(X = 26) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be time-consuming, so we can use the complement rule to make the calculation easier. The complement rule states that:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - P(X < 25)\n\nThis means we can find the probability of fewer than 25 households hosting a block party and subtract it from 1 to get the probability of at least 25 households hosting a block party. So, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 0, 1, ..., 24:\n\nP(X < 25) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 24)\n\nNow, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the sum:\n\nP(X < 25) = Σ [C(100, k) * (0.3)^k * (0.7)^(100-k)] for k = 0 to 24\n\nCalculating this sum can be done using statistical software or a calculator with a built-in binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF). Using a calculator or software, we find:\n\nP(X < 25) ≈ 0.0786\n\nNow, we can use the complement rule to find the probability of at least 25 households hosting a block party:\n\nP(X ≥ 25) = 1 - P(X < 25) = 1 - 0.0786 ≈ 0.9214\n\nSo, the probability that at least 25 households will host a block party during the summer is approximately 0.9214, or 92.14%."
