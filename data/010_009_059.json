    "message_2": "Let's first find the Euler characteristic of the original triangulation T. Since T consists of 10 triangles, we have F = 10. The vertices of the triangles are (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1), so we have V = 3. To find the number of edges E, we note that each triangle has 3 edges, and since there are 10 triangles, we have a total of 30 edges. However, each edge is shared by 2 triangles, so we need to divide by 2 to avoid double counting. Thus, E = 30/2 = 15.\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler characteristic of T:\nχ(T) = V - E + F = 3 - 15 + 10 = -2.\n\nNext, let's consider the space obtained by subdividing each triangle in T into 4 smaller triangles. For each of the 10 original triangles, we add 3 new vertices (the midpoints of the edges), 3 new edges (connecting the midpoints), and 4 new triangles. \n\nLet's compute the new number of vertices V', edges E', and faces F':\n\nV' = V + 3 * 10 = 3 + 30 = 33.\nE' = E + 3 * 10 = 15 + 30 = 45.\nF' = 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, we can compute the Euler characteristic of the subdivided space:\nχ(subdivided) = V' - E' + F' = 33 - 45 + 40 = 28.\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic of the space obtained by subdividing each triangle in T into 4 smaller triangles is 28."
