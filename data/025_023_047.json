Let $Z$ be a smooth subvariety of $X$ with dimension $d-1$, defined by $s$ equations. If the intersection of $Y$ and $Z$ has codimension at least $c$, then the intersection cohomology group $IH^k(Z \\cap Y)$ is non-zero only when $k = d - c - s$. \n\nSuppose $X$ is a smooth projective surface, $Y$ is a curve defined by a single equation in $X$, $Z$ is a point ($1$-dimensional subvariety) of $X$, and the intersection of $Y$ and $Z$ has codimension $1$ in $X$. If $d = 2$, $r=1$, and $s=2$, then what is the value of $k$ such that $IH^k(Z \\cap Y)$ is non-zero?",
    "message_2": "Given the values $d = 2$, $c = 1$, and $s = 2$, we can use the formula for $k$:\n\n$k = d - c - s = 2 - 1 - 2 = -1$\n\nHowever, since cohomology groups are only defined for non-negative integers, there is no value of $k$ such that $IH^k(Z \\cap Y)$ is non-zero in this case."
