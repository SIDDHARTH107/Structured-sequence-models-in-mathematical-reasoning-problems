    "message_2": "To determine the values of the higher Chern classes $c_k(M)$ for $k > 2$, we will use the splitting principle and the Whitney sum formula. The splitting principle states that for any complex vector bundle $E$ over a space $X$, there exists a space $Y$ and a map $f: Y \\to X$ such that the pullback bundle $f^*E$ splits into a direct sum of line bundles. In this case, we consider the tangent bundle $TM$ of the complex manifold $M$. \n\nLet $L_1, L_2, \\dots, L_n$ be the line bundles such that $f^*(TM) = L_1 \\oplus L_2 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus L_n$. The total Chern class of $TM$ is given by the product of the total Chern classes of the line bundles:\n\n$$\nc(TM) = c(L_1)c(L_2) \\cdots c(L_n).\n$$\n\nThe total Chern class of a line bundle $L_i$ is given by $c(L_i) = 1 + x_i$, where $x_i$ is the first Chern class of $L_i$. Therefore,\n\n$$\nc(TM) = (1 + x_1)(1 + x_2) \\cdots (1 + x_n).\n$$\n\nExpanding this product, we get:\n\n$$\nc(TM) = 1 + (x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n) + \\sum_{i < j} x_i x_j + \\dots + x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n.\n$$\n\nThe coefficients of this polynomial are the Chern classes of $TM$. Since $c_1(M) = 3$ and $c_2(M) = 10$, we have:\n\n$$\nc_1(TM) = x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n = 3,\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nc_2(TM) = \\sum_{i < j} x_i x_j = 10.\n$$\n\nFor $k > 2$, the Chern classes $c_k(M)$ are given by the coefficients of the polynomial $c(TM)$ involving monomials of degree $k$. However, since the maximum degree of the monomials in the expansion of $c(TM)$ is $n$, and $k > n$, there are no monomials of degree $k$ in the expansion. Therefore, the higher Chern classes $c_k(M)$ for $k > 2$ are all equal to 0."
