    "message_2": "To find the radian measure of the angle on the unit circle that corresponds to a cosine value of -1/2, we can use the properties of the unit circle and trigonometric functions.\n\nCosine is negative in the second and third quadrants of the unit circle. The reference angle for a cosine value of 1/2 is π/3 (or 60 degrees), as cos(π/3) = 1/2.\n\nIn the second quadrant, the angle with a reference angle of π/3 is:\n\nπ - π/3 = (3π/3) - (π/3) = 2π/3\n\nIn the third quadrant, the angle with a reference angle of π/3 is:\n\nπ + π/3 = (3π/3) + (π/3) = 4π/3\n\nSo, the radian measures of the angles on the unit circle that correspond to a cosine value of -1/2 are 2π/3 and 4π/3."
