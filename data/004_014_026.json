    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the curve y = x^2 between x = 0 and x = 2 about the x-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of the cross-sectional disks along the x-axis.\n\nThe area of each disk is given by A(x) = π * (y^2), where y = x^2. So, A(x) = π * (x^4).\n\nNow, we need to integrate A(x) from x = 0 to x = 2:\n\nVolume = ∫[x=0 to x=2] A(x) dx = ∫[x=0 to x=2] π * (x^4) dx\n\nTo integrate x^4, we use the power rule: ∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n = 4 in this case.\n\nSo, ∫x^4 dx = (x^5)/5 + C\n\nNow, we evaluate the integral from 0 to 2:\n\nVolume = π * [(2^5)/5 - (0^5)/5]\nVolume = π * [(32)/5]\nVolume = (32π)/5\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the curve y = x^2 between x = 0 and x = 2 about the x-axis is (32π)/5 cubic units."
