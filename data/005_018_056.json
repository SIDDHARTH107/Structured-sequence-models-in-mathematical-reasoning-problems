The data collected from the study is as follows:\n\n| Survival Time (months) | Number of Birds |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1-6 | 8 |\n| 7-12 | 12 |\n| 13-18 | 5 |\n| 19-24 | 3 |\n| 25+ | 2 |\n\nAssuming the survival times follow an exponential distribution, calculate the probability that a released bird from this species survives for at least 10 months in the wild.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that a released bird survives for at least 10 months, we first need to find the mean survival time (λ) for the given data. We can do this by finding the midpoint of each survival time range and multiplying it by the number of birds in that range, then dividing the sum by the total number of birds.\n\nMean survival time (λ) = (Sum of (midpoint * number of birds)) / Total number of birds\n\nMidpoints:\n1-6: 3.5\n7-12: 9.5\n13-18: 15.5\n19-24: 21.5\n25+: Assume the midpoint is 27.5 (since we don't have an upper limit)\n\nSum of (midpoint * number of birds) = (3.5 * 8) + (9.5 * 12) + (15.5 * 5) + (21.5 * 3) + (27.5 * 2) = 28 + 114 + 77.5 + 64.5 + 55 = 339\n\nTotal number of birds = 8 + 12 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 30\n\nMean survival time (λ) = 339 / 30 = 11.3 months\n\nNow that we have the mean survival time, we can use the exponential distribution formula to find the probability that a bird survives for at least 10 months:\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - (1 - e^(-10/λ))\n\nP(X ≥ 10) = 1 - (1 - e^(-10/11.3))\n\nP(X ≥ 10) ≈ 1 - (1 - e^(-0.885)) ≈ 1 - (1 - 0.412) ≈ 0.412\n\nSo, the probability that a released bird from this species survives for at least 10 months in the wild is approximately 41.2%."
