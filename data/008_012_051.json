    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x and y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  4 |\n    | 7 -2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | 22 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A (A^(-1)). To do this, we first find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = (3 * -2) - (4 * 7) = -6 - 28 = -34\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, let's find A^(-1).\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nadj(A) = | -2 -4 |\n         | -7  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = (-1/-34) * | -2 -4 |\n                     | -7  3 |\n\nA^(-1) = (1/34) * | -2 -4 |\n                  | -7  3 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x and y by multiplying A^(-1) with B.\n\nX = A^(-1) * B\n\n| x |   (1/34) * | -2 -4 | * | 10 |\n| y |             | -7  3 |   | 22 |\n\n| x |   (1/34) * | (-2*10) + (-4*22) |\n| y |             | (-7*10) + (3*22)  |\n\n| x |   (1/34) * | -20 - 88 |\n| y |             | -70 + 66 |\n\n| x |   (1/34) * | -108 |\n| y |             |  -4  |\n\nx = -108/34 = -54/17\ny = -4/34 = -2/17\n\nSo, the values of x and y are x = -54/17 and y = -2/17."
