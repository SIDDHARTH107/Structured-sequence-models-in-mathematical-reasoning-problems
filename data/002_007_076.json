    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a height of 8 cm and its bases have lengths of 10 cm and 16 cm respectively. What is the area of the trapezoid?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of the bases) * height\n\nIn this case, the height is 8 cm, and the bases have lengths of 10 cm and 16 cm. So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (10 + 16) * 8\n\nArea = (1/2) * 26 * 8\n\nArea = 13 * 8\n\nArea = 104 cmÂ²\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is 104 square centimeters."
