    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k accidents\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of workers (150)\n- k is the number of accidents (0, 1, 2, or 3)\n- p is the probability of an accident occurring to a worker (0.02)\n- (1-p) is the probability of an accident not occurring to a worker (0.98)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at most 3 accidents occurring, so we need to calculate the probabilities for 0, 1, 2, and 3 accidents and then sum them up.\n\nP(X ≤ 3) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)\n\nCalculating each probability:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(150, 0) * (0.02)^0 * (0.98)^150 ≈ 0.0023\nP(X = 1) = C(150, 1) * (0.02)^1 * (0.98)^149 ≈ 0.0346\nP(X = 2) = C(150, 2) * (0.02)^2 * (0.98)^148 ≈ 0.1299\nP(X = 3) = C(150, 3) * (0.02)^3 * (0.98)^147 ≈ 0.2340\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 3) ≈ 0.0023 + 0.0346 + 0.1299 + 0.2340 ≈ 0.4008\n\nSo, the probability that on a particular day, at most 3 accidents occur in the factory is approximately 0.4008 or 40.08%."
