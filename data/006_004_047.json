    "message_1": "Suppose you are playing a card game and you have a deck of 52 cards. You draw 3 cards from the deck without replacement. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 aces?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 2 aces, we can use the formula for combinations and probability:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nThere are 4 aces in a deck of 52 cards. We want to choose 2 aces, so we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = (4 * 3 * 2) / (2 * 2) = 6\n\nSo there are 6 ways to choose 2 aces from the 4 aces in the deck.\n\nNow, we need to consider the remaining card, which should not be an ace. There are 48 non-ace cards in the deck (52 cards - 4 aces). We want to choose 1 card from these 48 cards:\n\nC(48, 1) = 48! / (1!(48-1)!) = 48\n\nSo there are 48 ways to choose 1 non-ace card from the 48 non-ace cards in the deck.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from the deck of 52 cards:\n\nC(52, 3) = 52! / (3!(52-3)!) = (52 * 51 * 50) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 22100\n\nSo there are 22,100 ways to choose 3 cards from the deck of 52 cards.\n\nNow, we can find the probability of getting exactly 2 aces:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\nProbability = (6 ways to choose 2 aces * 48 ways to choose 1 non-ace card) / (22,100 ways to choose 3 cards)\nProbability = (6 * 48) / 22100\nProbability = 288 / 22100\n\nThe probability of getting exactly 2 aces when drawing 3 cards from a deck of 52 cards is 288/22100, which can be simplified to 12/925 or approximately 0.01297 (1.297% chance)."
