    "message_2": "Let $z = x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Then, we have:\n\n$f(z) = (x + iy)^2 + 2i(x + iy) - 3 = (x^2 - y^2 - 3) + i(2xy + 2x)$.\n\nNow, let $g(z) = f(z) + c = (x^2 - y^2 - 3) + i(2xy + 2x) + c$. We want the imaginary part of $g(z)$ to be zero on the circle $|z| = 2$. \n\nThe equation of the circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 4$. We want to find $c$ such that:\n\n$2xy + 2x = 0$ for all $x$ and $y$ satisfying $x^2 + y^2 = 4$.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$x(2y + 2) = 0$.\n\nSince $x^2 + y^2 = 4$, we know that $x$ cannot be zero. Therefore, we must have:\n\n$2y + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = -1$.\n\nNow, substituting $y = -1$ into the equation of the circle, we get:\n\n$x^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 3$.\n\nSo, $x = \\pm\\sqrt{3}$. Now, we can find the value of $c$ by substituting these values of $x$ and $y$ into the equation for $g(z)$:\n\n$g(z) = (\\pm\\sqrt{3})^2 - (-1)^2 - 3 + c = 3 - 1 - 3 + c = c - 1$.\n\nSince the imaginary part of $g(z)$ is zero, we must have $c - 1 = 0$, which implies that $c = 1$. Therefore, the real constant $c$ is equal to $1$."
