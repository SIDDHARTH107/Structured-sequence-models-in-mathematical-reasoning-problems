Find an invertible matrix P and a diagonal matrix D such that A = PDP^-1.\n\nSolution:\nFirst, we need to find the eigenvalues of matrix A. Solving for det(A - λI) = 0, we get (λ + 3)(λ - 1) = 0, so λ = -3 or λ = 1.\n\nNext, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues. \n\nFor λ = -3, we solve (A - (-3)I)x = 0, or [[2, 2], [4, 6]]x = 0. This reduces to [1, 2]x = 0, so the corresponding eigenvector is [-2, 1].\n\nFor λ = 1, we solve (A - I)x = 0, or [[-2, 2], [4, 2]]x = 0. This reduces to [-1, 1]x = 0, so the corresponding eigenvector is [1, 1].\n\nNow, we form the matrix P by concatenating the two eigenvectors as columns: P = [[-2, 1], [1, 1]].\n\nWe also form the diagonal matrix D by placing the eigenvalues along the diagonal: D = [[-3, 0], [0, 1]].\n\nFinally, we compute P^-1 and the diagonalization: \n\nP^-1 = (1/3)[[1, -1], [2, -2]]\n\nA = PDP^-1 = [[-2, 1], [1, 1]][[-3, 0], [0, 1]](1/3)[[1, -1], [2, -2]] = [[-1, 2], [4, 3]].\n\nTherefore, we have diagonalized the matrix A.",
