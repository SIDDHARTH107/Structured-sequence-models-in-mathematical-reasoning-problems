    "message_2": "To find the shortest distance between a point on the sphere and a point on the plane, we can use the formula for the distance between a point and a plane.\n\nLet's first find the coordinates of the center of the sphere, which is at the origin (0, 0, 0).\n\nNow, let's use the formula for the distance between a point (x₀, y₀, z₀) and a plane Ax + By + Cz = D:\n\nDistance = |Ax₀ + By₀ + Cz₀ - D| / √(A² + B² + C²)\n\nIn our case, A = 2, B = 1, C = -1, D = 6, and the point (x₀, y₀, z₀) is the center of the sphere (0, 0, 0).\n\nDistance = |(2 * 0) + (1 * 0) + (-1 * 0) - 6| / √(2² + 1² + (-1)²)\nDistance = |-6| / √(4 + 1 + 1)\nDistance = 6 / √6\n\nNow, since the radius of the sphere is 5, the shortest distance between a point on the sphere and a point on the plane is the difference between the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane and the radius of the sphere:\n\nShortest distance = (6 / √6) - 5\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by √6:\n\nShortest distance = (6√6 / 6) - 5\nShortest distance = √6 - 5\n\nSo, the shortest distance between a point on the sphere and a point on the plane is √6 - 5."
