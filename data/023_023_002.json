    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the network, we need to take the Fourier transform of both the input signal f(t) and the output signal g(t), and then find the ratio of the output to the input in the frequency domain.\n\nFirst, let's find the Fourier transform of the input signal f(t) = 3cos(2πt) + 2sin(4πt). The Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2) [δ(ω - ω₀) + δ(ω + ω₀)]\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function and ω₀ is the angular frequency. Similarly, the Fourier transform of a sine function is given by:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2j) [δ(ω - ω₀) - δ(ω + ω₀)]\n\nApplying these formulas to f(t), we get:\n\nF(ω) = (3/2) [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)] + (1/j) [δ(ω - 4π) - δ(ω + 4π)]\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of the output signal g(t) = 4cos(2πt + π/3) + 2sin(2πt + π/4). We can rewrite g(t) as:\n\ng(t) = 4cos(2πt)cos(π/3) - 4sin(2πt)sin(π/3) + 2cos(2πt)sin(π/4) + 2sin(2πt)cos(π/4)\n\ng(t) = (2√3)cos(2πt) - (2√3)sin(2πt) + √2cos(2πt) + √2sin(2πt)\n\nNow, applying the Fourier transform formulas to g(t), we get:\n\nG(ω) = (√3) [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)] - (√3/j) [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)] + (√2/2) [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)] + (√2/2j) [δ(ω - 2π) - δ(ω + 2π)]\n\nNow, we can find the frequency response H(ω) by taking the ratio of the output to the input in the frequency domain:\n\nH(ω) = G(ω) / F(ω)\n\nAt 2 Hz (ω = 2π), we have:\n\nH(2π) = [(√3 + √2/2) + (√2/2 - √3)j] / [(3/2) + 0j]\n\nH(2π) = (2√3 + √2) / 3\n\nAt 4 Hz (ω = 4π), we have:\n\nH(4π) = [0 + 0j] / [0 + 1j]\n\nH(4π) = 0\n\nSo, the frequency response of the network at 2 Hz is (2√3 + √2) / 3 and at 4 Hz is 0."
