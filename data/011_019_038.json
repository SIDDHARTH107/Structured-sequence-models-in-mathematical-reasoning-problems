In any two distinct rows, the number of columns in which the entries are the same is at most 1.\n\nThe given Orthogonal Array OA(4,3,2) is:\n\n    1 1 1\n    1 2 2\n    2 1 2\n    2 2 1\n\nTo make it a complete OA(4,3,2), we need to check if there are any additional rows that can be added while maintaining the properties of an orthogonal array.\n\nLet's consider the possible additional rows:\n\n1. 1 1 2: This row is not valid because it has two columns in common with the first row (1 1 1).\n2. 1 1 1: This row is not valid because it is identical to the first row.\n3. 1 2 1: This row is not valid because it has two columns in common with the second row (1 2 2).\n4. 1 2 2: This row is not valid because it is identical to the second row.\n5. 2 1 1: This row is not valid because it has two columns in common with the third row (2 1 2).\n6. 2 1 2: This row is not valid because it is identical to the third row.\n7. 2 2 2: This row is not valid because it has two columns in common with the fourth row (2 2 1).\n8. 2 2 1: This row is not valid because it is identical to the fourth row.\n\nSince none of the additional rows can be added without violating the properties of an orthogonal array, we cannot add any more rows to the existing array to make it a complete OA(4,3,2).\n\nSo, the answer is 0 additional rows."
