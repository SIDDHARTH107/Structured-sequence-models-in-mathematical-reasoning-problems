    "message_1": "In an auction, there are 4 bidders with valuations of $10, $20, $30, and $40 respectively for the item being sold. The auction is a sealed-bid first-price auction, where the highest bidder wins the item and pays their bid. What is the expected revenue of the auctioneer if the bidders bid their true valuations?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid first-price auction, the highest bidder wins the item and pays their bid. If the bidders bid their true valuations, the bidder with the highest valuation will always win the auction.\n\nIn this case, the bidder with a valuation of $40 will always win the auction, as their valuation is higher than the other bidders. Since they are bidding their true valuation, they will bid $40.\n\nTherefore, the expected revenue of the auctioneer in this scenario is $40."
