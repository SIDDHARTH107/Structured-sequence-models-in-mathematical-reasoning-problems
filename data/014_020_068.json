    "message_2": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"EEQGSRMD\" using the Vigenere cipher with the keyword \"MATH\", we need to reverse the encryption process. The Vigenere cipher uses a table of alphabets called the Vigenere square, where each row is shifted one position to the left compared to the previous row.\n\nFirst, we need to repeat the keyword \"MATH\" to match the length of the ciphertext: \"MATHMATH\".\n\nNow, for each letter in the ciphertext, we will find the corresponding row in the Vigenere square using the keyword letter and then find the column that matches the ciphertext letter. The column number (starting from 0) will give us the plaintext letter.\n\n1. E (ciphertext) with M (keyword): In the M row, find E -> Column 4 -> E (plaintext)\n2. E (ciphertext) with A (keyword): In the A row, find E -> Column 4 -> E (plaintext)\n3. Q (ciphertext) with T (keyword): In the T row, find Q -> Column 0 -> A (plaintext)\n4. G (ciphertext) with H (keyword): In the H row, find G -> Column 18 -> S (plaintext)\n5. S (ciphertext) with M (keyword): In the M row, find S -> Column 8 -> I (plaintext)\n6. R (ciphertext) with A (keyword): In the A row, find R -> Column 17 -> R (plaintext)\n7. M (ciphertext) with T (keyword): In the T row, find M -> Column 12 -> M (plaintext)\n8. D (ciphertext) with H (keyword): In the H row, find D -> Column 3 -> D (plaintext)\n\nSo, the decrypted plaintext is \"EEASIRMD\"."
