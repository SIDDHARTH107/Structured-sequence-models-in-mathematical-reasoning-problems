    "message_2": "To find the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω), we will use the following formula:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[F(ω) * e^(iωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nWe are given F(ω) = 2ωe^(-2iω). So, we need to compute the following integral:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[2ωe^(-2iω) * e^(iωt) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nFirst, let's combine the exponential terms:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * ∫[2ωe^(iω(t - 2)) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, let's use integration by parts to solve the integral. We'll let u = ω and dv = e^(iω(t - 2)) dω. Then, du = dω and v = (1 / i(t - 2)) * e^(iω(t - 2)).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫[u dv] = uv - ∫[v du]\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * [(2ω / i(t - 2)) * e^(iω(t - 2)) - ∫[(2 / i(t - 2)) * e^(iω(t - 2)) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we need to compute the remaining integral:\n\n∫[(2 / i(t - 2)) * e^(iω(t - 2)) dω] from -∞ to ∞\n\nThis is a standard Fourier transform integral, which can be solved using the Dirac delta function:\n\n∫[e^(iω(t - 2)) dω] from -∞ to ∞ = 2πδ(t - 2)\n\nSo, the remaining integral becomes:\n\n(2 / i(t - 2)) * 2πδ(t - 2)\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for f(t):\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * [(2ω / i(t - 2)) * e^(iω(t - 2)) - 2π(2 / i(t - 2)) * δ(t - 2)]\n\nThe first term in the brackets vanishes when we take the limits from -∞ to ∞, since the exponential term oscillates and averages out to zero. So, we are left with:\n\nf(t) = (1 / 2π) * [- 4π / i(t - 2) * δ(t - 2)]\n\nThe 2π terms cancel out:\n\nf(t) = -2 / i(t - 2) * δ(t - 2)\n\nThis is the inverse Fourier transform of F(ω), which represents the original signal as a function of time, f(t), in volts."
