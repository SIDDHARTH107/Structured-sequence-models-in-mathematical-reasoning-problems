    "message_2": "The symmetric difference between two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B:\n\nA ∩ B = {} (since A and B have no common elements)\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's confirm that the symmetric difference is commutative. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nWe already know that A ∪ B = B ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} and A ∩ B = B ∩ A = {}.\n\nSo, B Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} - {} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nSince A Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} and B Δ A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, we can conclude that the symmetric difference is commutative."
