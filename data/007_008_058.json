    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p â‰¡ a (mod p). In other words, if we raise an integer a to the power of a prime number p and divide the result by p, the remainder will be a.\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the remainder when $5^{13}$ is divided by 13. Since 13 is a prime number, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n$5^{13} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{13}$\n\nSo, the remainder when $5^{13}$ is divided by 13 is 5."
