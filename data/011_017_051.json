    "message_2": "A Latin square is an n × n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this case, we have a 4x4 Latin square with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nSince the top row is already filled, we need to determine the number of ways to fill the remaining 3 rows such that each number appears once in each row and column.\n\nLet's consider the second row. There are 3 possible positions for the number 1 (since it cannot be in the same column as the 1 in the first row). After placing the 1, there are 2 possible positions for the number 2. This leaves only one position for the numbers 3 and 4.\n\nNow, let's move to the third row. There are 2 possible positions for the number 1 (since it cannot be in the same column as the 1 in the first or second row). After placing the 1, there is only one position left for the number 2, and the positions for the numbers 3 and 4 are determined.\n\nFinally, the fourth row is completely determined by the previous rows, as there is only one possible position for each number.\n\nSo, the total number of different Latin squares that can be formed in this way is:\n\n3 (ways to place 1 in the second row) × 2 (ways to place 2 in the second row) × 2 (ways to place 1 in the third row) = 3 × 2 × 2 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 different 4x4 Latin squares that can be formed with a given top row."
