    "message_1": "A math student needs to find the 95% confidence interval for the average weight of a sample of 50 apples. The sample mean weight is 200g with a standard deviation of 20g. What is the range of weights that you can be 95% confident contains the true mean weight of all apples of the same variety?",
    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the average weight of the apples, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case), σ is the standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nGiven:\nx̄ = 200g (sample mean weight)\nσ = 20g (standard deviation)\nn = 50 (sample size)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = 200 ± (1.96 * (20 / √50))\n\nCI = 200 ± (1.96 * (20 / 7.071))\n\nCI = 200 ± (1.96 * 2.828)\n\nCI = 200 ± 5.54\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the average weight of the apples is (194.46g, 205.54g). We can be 95% confident that the true mean weight of all apples of the same variety lies within this range."
