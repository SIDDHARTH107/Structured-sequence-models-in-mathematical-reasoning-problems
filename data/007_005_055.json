    "message_2": "To find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 6, 12, and 18, we can use the prime factorization method.\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number:\n6 = 2 × 3\n12 = 2^2 × 3\n18 = 2 × 3^2\n\n2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor in the given numbers:\n2^2 (from 12) and 3^2 (from 18)\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers of each prime factor together:\nLCM = 2^2 × 3^2 = 4 × 9 = 36\n\nSo, the LCM of 6, 12, and 18 is 36."
