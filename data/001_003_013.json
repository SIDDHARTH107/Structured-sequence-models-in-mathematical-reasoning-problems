    "message_2": "First, we will solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other variable. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\n2x + 3y = 12\n\n2x = 12 - 3y\n\nx = (12 - 3y) / 2\n\nNow, we will substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n-4x + 5y = 7\n\n-4((12 - 3y) / 2) + 5y = 7\n\n-2(12 - 3y) + 5y = 7\n\n-24 + 6y + 5y = 7\n\n11y = 31\n\ny = 31 / 11\n\ny = 2.818181818181818\n\nNow, we will substitute the value of y back into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = (12 - 3y) / 2\n\nx = (12 - 3(2.818181818181818)) / 2\n\nx = (12 - 8.454545454545455) / 2\n\nx = 3.545454545454545 / 2\n\nx = 1.7727272727272727\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = 1.7727272727272727\ny = 2.818181818181818"
