    "message_2": "To determine the maximum amplitude of vibration of the bridge using Fourier analysis, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Find the fundamental frequency of the bridge.\n2. Calculate the force exerted by the truck on the bridge.\n3. Determine the Fourier coefficients for the force function.\n4. Calculate the amplitude of each mode of vibration.\n5. Find the maximum amplitude of vibration.\n\nStep 1: Find the fundamental frequency of the bridge\nThe fundamental frequency (f1) of a vibrating string or bridge can be found using the formula:\n\nf1 = (1/2L) * sqrt(T/μ)\n\nwhere L is the length of the bridge, T is the tension in the bridge, and μ is the mass per unit length.\n\nGiven the mass per unit length (μ) is 500 kg/m and the length (L) is 100 m, we can find the tension (T) using the formula for the fundamental frequency of a vibrating string:\n\nT = (f1 * 2L)^2 * μ\n\nHowever, we don't have the fundamental frequency (f1) given. Without this information, we cannot proceed with the Fourier analysis to determine the maximum amplitude of vibration of the bridge.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the force exerted by the truck on the bridge\nThe force exerted by the truck on the bridge is equal to its weight, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF = m * g\n\nwhere m is the mass of the truck (10,000 kg) and g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2).\n\nF = 10,000 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 98,100 N\n\nStep 3: Determine the Fourier coefficients for the force function\nTo determine the Fourier coefficients for the force function, we would need to know the shape of the force distribution along the bridge as the truck moves across it. This information is not provided, so we cannot proceed with this step.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the amplitude of each mode of vibration\nWithout the Fourier coefficients, we cannot calculate the amplitude of each mode of vibration.\n\nStep 5: Find the maximum amplitude of vibration\nSince we don't have the necessary information to calculate the amplitude of each mode of vibration, we cannot determine the maximum amplitude of vibration of the bridge.\n\nIn conclusion, without the fundamental frequency of the bridge and the shape of the force distribution along the bridge, we cannot determine the maximum amplitude of vibration of the bridge using Fourier analysis."
