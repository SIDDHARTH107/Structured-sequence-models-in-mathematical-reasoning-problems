    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set (denoted as ∅ or {}) is a subset of set A and set B, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of set A and set B.\n\nBy definition, a set X is a subset of set Y (denoted as X ⊆ Y) if every element of X is also an element of Y. In other words, for all x in X, x ∈ Y.\n\nNow, let's consider the empty set (∅). The empty set has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A or set B. Since there are no counterexamples, we can conclude that the empty set is a subset of set A and set B.\n\nFormally, we can write this as:\n∅ ⊆ A and ∅ ⊆ B\n\nThus, the empty set is a subset of set A and set B."
