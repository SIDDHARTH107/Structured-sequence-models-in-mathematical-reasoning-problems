    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of G, we can use the fact that the minimum number of edges required to form a cycle in a graph is 3 (a triangle).\n\nLet's consider the maximum number of edges a graph with 10 vertices can have without forming a cycle of length 3. This can be achieved by constructing a bipartite graph, where vertices are divided into two sets, and all edges go between the sets. In this case, the girth would be 4 or more.\n\nFor a bipartite graph with two sets of vertices A and B, the maximum number of edges is the product of the sizes of A and B. Without loss of generality, let's assume |A| >= |B|. The maximum number of edges occurs when |A| = 5 and |B| = 5, giving a total of 5 * 5 = 25 edges. However, we have only 15 edges in our graph G.\n\nSince G has fewer edges than the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with 10 vertices, it must contain a cycle of length 3 (a triangle). Therefore, the girth of G is 3."
