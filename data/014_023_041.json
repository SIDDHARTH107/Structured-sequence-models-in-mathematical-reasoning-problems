    "message_2": "A Rail Fence cipher of depth 4 arranges the characters in a zigzag pattern with 4 rows. To find the maximum number of characters that can be encrypted, we need to determine the pattern of characters in the zigzag.\n\nThe pattern consists of the following:\n\n1. The first row has one character for every full cycle of the zigzag.\n2. The second and third rows have two characters for every full cycle of the zigzag.\n3. The fourth row has one character for every full cycle of the zigzag.\n\nA full cycle of the zigzag consists of 6 characters (1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6). Therefore, the maximum number of characters that can be encrypted using a Rail Fence cipher of depth 4 is not fixed and can be any multiple of 6, depending on the length of the plaintext message."
