    "message_1": "Here's a combinatorial optimization problem for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose you have a set of 10 integers, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, and you want to select a subset of size 5 such that the sum of the numbers in the subset is minimized. What is the smallest possible sum you can achieve?",
    "message_2": "To minimize the sum of the subset of size 5, you should select the smallest 5 integers from the given set. These integers are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The sum of these numbers is:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\n\nSo, the smallest possible sum you can achieve is 15."
