Find the Reeb vector field and contact form for α, and show that their flow preserves α.\"",
    "message_2": "To find the Reeb vector field, we need to satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. α(R) = 1\n2. dα(R, ·) = 0\n\nGiven the contact form α = dx + ydz, let's compute its exterior derivative dα:\n\ndα = d(dx + ydz) = d(dx) + d(ydz) = 0 + dy ∧ dz = dy ∧ dz\n\nNow, let R = a ∂/∂x + b ∂/∂y + c ∂/∂z be the Reeb vector field. We need to find the coefficients a, b, and c such that the conditions mentioned above are satisfied.\n\n1. α(R) = 1:\n\nα(R) = (dx + ydz)(a ∂/∂x + b ∂/∂y + c ∂/∂z) = a dx(∂/∂x) + b dx(∂/∂y) + c dx(∂/∂z) + a ydz(∂/∂x) + b ydz(∂/∂y) + c ydz(∂/∂z) = a + cy\n\nTo satisfy α(R) = 1, we must have a = 1 and cy = 0. Since y is a coordinate, it can take any value, so we must have c = 0.\n\n2. dα(R, ·) = 0:\n\ndα(R, ·) = dy ∧ dz(a ∂/∂x + b ∂/∂y) = a dy ∧ dz(∂/∂x) + b dy ∧ dz(∂/∂y) = -a dz(∂/∂x) + b dy(∂/∂x) = -a + b\n\nTo satisfy dα(R, ·) = 0, we must have -a + b = 0. Since we already found that a = 1, we get b = 1.\n\nThus, the Reeb vector field R is:\n\nR = ∂/∂x + ∂/∂y\n\nNow, let's show that the flow of R preserves α. The Lie derivative of α along R is given by:\n\nL_R α = d(α(R)) + dα(R, ·)\n\nSince α(R) = 1, d(α(R)) = 0. We already showed that dα(R, ·) = 0. Therefore, L_R α = 0, which means that the flow of R preserves α."
