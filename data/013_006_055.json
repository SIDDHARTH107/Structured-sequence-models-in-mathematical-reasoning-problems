    "message_1": "Alice and Bob are playing a Stag Hunt game. They both can hunt a stag, which will give them a total of 10 points or they can hunt a rabbit, which will give each of them only 2 points. If Alice and Bob don't coordinate and each hunt a different animal, they will each get 0 points. Suppose Alice believes that Bob will choose to hunt stag with probability \"p\", and she wants to maximize her expected payoff. What should Alice do?",
    "message_2": "To maximize her expected payoff, Alice should calculate the expected payoff for each of her choices (hunting a stag or hunting a rabbit) based on the probability \"p\" that Bob will choose to hunt a stag.\n\nExpected payoff for Alice if she hunts a stag:\nE(stag) = p * (10 points) + (1 - p) * (0 points) = 10p\n\nExpected payoff for Alice if she hunts a rabbit:\nE(rabbit) = p * (0 points) + (1 - p) * (2 points) = 2(1 - p)\n\nNow, Alice should compare the expected payoffs for each choice:\n\nIf E(stag) > E(rabbit), then Alice should hunt a stag.\nIf E(stag) < E(rabbit), then Alice should hunt a rabbit.\nIf E(stag) = E(rabbit), then Alice can choose either option as they have the same expected payoff.\n\nLet's find the condition when E(stag) = E(rabbit):\n\n10p = 2(1 - p)\n10p = 2 - 2p\n12p = 2\np = 1/6 â‰ˆ 0.1667\n\nSo, Alice should follow this strategy:\n\n1. If p > 1/6, Alice should hunt a stag.\n2. If p < 1/6, Alice should hunt a rabbit.\n3. If p = 1/6, Alice can choose either option as they have the same expected payoff."
