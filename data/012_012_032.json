    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To find the girth, we need to know more information about the graph G, such as the adjacency matrix or the list of edges. With only the number of vertices and edges, we cannot determine the girth of the graph G. Please provide more information about the graph."
