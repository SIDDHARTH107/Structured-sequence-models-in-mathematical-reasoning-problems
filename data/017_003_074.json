    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element in G can be written as a power of g.\n\nSince G has order 17, and 17 is a prime number, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide the order of G. Therefore, the possible orders of elements in G are 1 and 17.\n\nNow, let's consider an element g in G such that g is not the identity element (i.e., g ≠ e, where e is the identity element). Since g is not the identity element, its order cannot be 1. Thus, the order of g must be 17.\n\nRecall that the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e. Since the order of g is 17, we have g^17 = e. This means that the set {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^16} contains 17 distinct elements, as each power of g is distinct until we reach g^17 = e.\n\nNow, we claim that the set {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^16} is equal to the group G. To show this, we need to prove that the set contains 17 distinct elements and that it is closed under the group operation.\n\nFirst, we know that the set contains 17 distinct elements, as we mentioned earlier. Since G has order 17, this means that the set contains all elements of G.\n\nNext, we need to show that the set is closed under the group operation. Let a = g^i and b = g^j be two elements in the set, where 0 ≤ i, j ≤ 16. Then, the product ab = g^i * g^j = g^(i+j). Since 0 ≤ i+j ≤ 32, we can use the modulo operation to ensure that the exponent stays within the range of 0 to 16. Thus, ab = g^((i+j) mod 17). Since (i+j) mod 17 is an integer between 0 and 16, ab is also an element in the set.\n\nTherefore, the set {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^16} is equal to the group G and is closed under the group operation. This means that G is generated by the element g, and thus G is a cyclic group."
