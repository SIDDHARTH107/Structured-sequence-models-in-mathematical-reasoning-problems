    "message_2": "To find the area between the two curves, we first need to find the points of intersection. We can do this by setting y=x^2 equal to y=2x-x^2.\n\nx^2 = 2x - x^2\n2x^2 = 2x\nx^2 = x\nx(x-1) = 0\n\nThe points of intersection are x=0 and x=1. Now we can find the area between the curves by integrating the difference of the functions over the interval [0, 1].\n\nArea = ∫(2x - x^2 - x^2)dx from 0 to 1\nArea = ∫(2x - 2x^2)dx from 0 to 1\n\nNow, we can find the antiderivative of the function:\n\nAntiderivative = x^2 - (2/3)x^3 + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of the interval:\n\nArea = (1^2 - (2/3)(1)^3) - (0^2 - (2/3)(0)^3)\nArea = (1 - (2/3)) - (0)\nArea = 1/3\n\nSo, the area between the two curves y=x^2 and y=2x-x^2 for 0<=x<=2 is 1/3 square units."
