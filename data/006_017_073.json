    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem based on the subtopic Probability of a certain type of traffic accident occurring on a road:\n\nOn a particular road, the probability of a car accident involving only one vehicle is 0.25, and the probability of an accident involving more than one vehicle is 0.75. If there are five car accidents on this road in a month, what is the probability that exactly three of them will involve only one vehicle?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, accidents involving only one vehicle) in n trials (in this case, 5 accidents)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.25)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 3)\n\nFirst, let's find C(5, 3):\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * 2!)\nC(5, 3) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 * 2)\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(5, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^(5-3)\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.25)^3 * (1-0.25)^(5-3)\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.25)^3 * (0.75)^2\nP(X = 3) = 10 * 0.015625 * 0.5625\nP(X = 3) â‰ˆ 0.0879\n\nSo, the probability that exactly three of the five car accidents will involve only one vehicle is approximately 0.0879 or 8.79%."
