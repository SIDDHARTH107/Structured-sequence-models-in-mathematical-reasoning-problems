    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem for the math student to solve:\n\nConsider the partial differential equation:\n\n$$u_t = k u_{xx}$$\n\nwith initial condition $u(x,0) = f(x) = x^2$ and boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0$. \n\nUsing Fourier series, find the solution $u(x,t)$ to the above partial differential equation for $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $t \\geq 0$, assuming $k > 0$.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using Fourier series, we first assume a solution of the form:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the PDE, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T'(t) = kX''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by $kXT$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{kT(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ only and the right side is a function of $x$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{kT(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$ with boundary conditions $X(0) = X(1) = 0$\n2) $T'(t) + k\\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nSolving the first ODE, we get the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues:\n\n$$X_n(x) = \\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\n$$\\lambda_n = n\\pi$$\n\nSolving the second ODE, we get:\n\n$$T_n(t) = e^{-k(n\\pi)^2t}$$\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as a sum of the product of these eigenfunctions and time functions:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi x) e^{-k(n\\pi)^2t}$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = x^2$:\n\n$$x^2 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nWe can find the $A_n$ coefficients using the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\n$$A_n = 2\\int_{0}^{1} x^2 \\sin(n\\pi x) dx$$\n\nIntegrating by parts twice, we get:\n\n$$A_n = \\frac{2(-1)^{n+1}}{n^3\\pi^3}$$\n\nFinally, the solution to the partial differential equation is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2(-1)^{n+1}}{n^3\\pi^3} \\sin(n\\pi x) e^{-k(n\\pi)^2t}$$\n\nThis is the solution for $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $t \\geq 0$, assuming $k > 0$."
