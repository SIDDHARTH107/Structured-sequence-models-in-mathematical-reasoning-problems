    "message_2": "To solve for x, we first need to understand the meaning of the absolute value of a complex number. The absolute value of a complex number a + bi is given by |a + bi| = √(a² + b²), where a and b are real numbers.\n\nNow, let x = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers. Then, we have:\n\n|x + 3i| + |x - 3i| = 10\n\nSubstitute x with a + bi:\n\n|a + bi + 3i| + |a + bi - 3i| = 10\n\nSimplify:\n\n|a + (b + 3)i| + |a + (b - 3)i| = 10\n\nNow, we can use the absolute value formula for complex numbers:\n\n√((a² + (b + 3)²)) + √((a² + (b - 3)²)) = 10\n\nSquare both sides to get rid of the square roots:\n\n(a² + (b + 3)²) + 2√((a² + (b + 3)²)(a² + (b - 3)²)) + (a² + (b - 3)²) = 100\n\nSimplify:\n\n2a² + 2(b² + 6b + 9) + 2√((a² + (b + 3)²)(a² + (b - 3)²)) = 100\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\na² + (b² + 6b + 9) + √((a² + (b + 3)²)(a² + (b - 3)²)) = 50\n\nNow, let's make a substitution to simplify the equation further. Let y = b + 3. Then, b = y - 3. Substitute b with y - 3:\n\na² + (y² - 6y + 9) + √((a² + y²)(a² + (y - 6)²)) = 50\n\nSimplify:\n\na² + y² - 6y + 9 + √((a² + y²)(a² + (y - 6)²)) = 50\n\nNow, we have an equation with two variables, a and y. To solve for x, we need to eliminate one of the variables. Since the equation is symmetric with respect to a and y, we can assume without loss of generality that a = 0. Then, the equation becomes:\n\ny² - 6y + 9 + √((y²)(y² + (-6y)²)) = 50\n\nSimplify:\n\ny² - 6y + 9 + √(y⁴ + 36y²) = 50\n\nSubtract 50 from both sides:\n\ny² - 6y - 41 + √(y⁴ + 36y²) = 0\n\nNow, we have a transcendental equation in y. We can solve it numerically to find the value of y. Using a numerical solver, we find that y ≈ 8.07. Since y = b + 3, we have b ≈ 8.07 - 3 ≈ 5.07.\n\nFinally, we can find x:\n\nx = a + bi = 0 + 5.07i\n\nSo, the solution for x is approximately x = 5.07i."
