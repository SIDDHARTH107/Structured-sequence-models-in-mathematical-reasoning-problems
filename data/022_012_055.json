    "message_2": "To find the zeros of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the numerator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1:\n\nz = (± √(-4)) / 2 = ± i\n\nSo, the zeros of f(z) are z = i and z = -i, both with order 1 (since they are simple roots of the quadratic equation).\n\nNow, to find the poles of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator is equal to zero:\n\n(z - 1)(z - i) = 0\n\nThis equation has two simple roots:\n\nz = 1 and z = i\n\nSo, the poles of f(z) are z = 1 and z = i, both with order 1 (since they are simple roots of the linear factors in the denominator).\n\nIn summary, f(z) has zeros at z = i and z = -i, both with order 1, and poles at z = 1 and z = i, both with order 1."
