    "message_2": "To find the percentage of ball bearings with a diameter between 5.8mm and 6.2mm, we can use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is: z = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWhere z is the z-score, X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we find the z-scores for 5.8mm and 6.2mm:\n\nz1 = (5.8 - 6) / 0.2 = -0.2 / 0.2 = -1\nz2 = (6.2 - 6) / 0.2 = 0.2 / 0.2 = 1\n\nNow, we look up the z-scores in the standard normal distribution table or use a calculator with a built-in z-score function. The table gives us the area to the left of the z-score.\n\nArea to the left of z1 (-1) = 0.1587\nArea to the left of z2 (1) = 0.8413\n\nTo find the percentage of ball bearings with a diameter between 5.8mm and 6.2mm, we subtract the area to the left of z1 from the area to the left of z2:\n\nPercentage = (Area to the left of z2) - (Area to the left of z1)\nPercentage = 0.8413 - 0.1587\nPercentage = 0.6826\n\nSo, approximately 68.26% of ball bearings will have a diameter between 5.8mm and 6.2mm."
