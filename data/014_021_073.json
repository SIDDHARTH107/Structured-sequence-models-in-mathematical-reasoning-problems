    "message_1": "Consider the following message encrypted using the Hill cipher: \n\n```\nZKQG\n```\n\nAssuming that this message was encrypted using a 2x2 matrix key in Hill cipher, find the original message. The matrix key is:\n\n```\n[5 8]\n[19 10]\n```\n\nNote: In Hill cipher, the message is divided into groups of fixed size (determined by the size of the key matrix) and each group is transformed using a matrix multiplication with the key matrix. The result is then converted back into letters using a specific mapping (often the alphabet is used).",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Hill cipher, we need to find the inverse of the key matrix and then multiply it with the encrypted message matrix. First, let's convert the encrypted message into numerical values using the alphabetical mapping (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25):\n\nZKQG -> 25 10 16 6\n\nNow, let's arrange these values into a 2x2 matrix:\n\n```\n[25 10]\n[16  6]\n```\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse of the key matrix:\n\n```\n[ 5  8]\n[19 10]\n```\n\nTo find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, we can use the following formula:\n\n```\nA = [a b]\n    [c d]\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * [ d -b]\n                          [-c  a]\n```\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of the matrix A.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of the key matrix:\n\ndet(A) = (5 * 10) - (8 * 19) = 50 - 152 = -102\n\nNow, let's find the inverse of the key matrix:\n\nA_inv = (1/-102) * [ 10 -8]\n                           [-19  5]\n\nA_inv = [-10/102  8/102]\n            [ 19/102 -5/102]\n\nNow, let's multiply the inverse of the key matrix with the encrypted message matrix:\n\n```\n[-10/102  8/102] [25 10]   [-10/102 * 25 + 8/102 * 16  -10/102 * 10 + 8/102 * 6]\n[ 19/102 -5/102] [16  6] = [ 19/102 * 25 - 5/102 * 16   19/102 * 10 - 5/102 * 6]\n```\n\nAfter performing the matrix multiplication, we get:\n\n```\n[-2.941176  0.588235]\n[ 4.411765 -0.882353]\n```\n\nNow, let's round the values to the nearest integers:\n\n```\n[-3  1]\n[ 4 -1]\n```\n\nSince we can't have negative values in the alphabet mapping, we need to add 26 to the negative values to get the corresponding positive values:\n\n```\n[23  1]\n[ 4 25]\n```\n\nNow, let's convert these numerical values back into letters using the alphabetical mapping:\n\n23 1 4 25 -> XBYZ\n\nSo, the decrypted message is \"XBYZ\"."
