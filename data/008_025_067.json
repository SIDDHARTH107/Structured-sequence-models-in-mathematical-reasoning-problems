    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution, elimination, or comparison. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can observe that the second equation is a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n4x + 6y = 20\n\nNow, we have:\n\n4x + 6y = 20\n4x + 6y = 15\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x + 6y) = 20 - 15\n0 = 5\n\nSince we got a false statement (0 â‰  5), this means that the system of linear equations has no solution."
