    "message_2": "To prove that G is a cyclic group, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g.\n\nSince |G| = 7, we know that G has 7 elements. Let's consider an arbitrary element g in G, where g is not the identity element e. We will show that the order of g is 7, which implies that G is a cyclic group.\n\nBy Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of G must divide the order of G. Since G has prime order p = 7, the only possible orders for subgroups of G are 1 and 7. The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup containing just the identity element e.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by g, denoted as H = ⟨g⟩. Since g is not the identity element, the order of H cannot be 1. Therefore, the order of H must be 7, which means that H = G.\n\nSince H is generated by g, every element in G can be expressed as a power of g. Thus, G is a cyclic group, as required."
