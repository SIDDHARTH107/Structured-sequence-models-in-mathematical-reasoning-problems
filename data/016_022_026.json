    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each iteration, the number of tetrahedra increases by a factor of 4.\n\nTo find the total number of triangles in the 6th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal number of triangles = 4^n * T\n\nwhere n is the iteration number and T is the number of triangles in the base tetrahedron (which is 4).\n\nFor the 6th iteration:\n\nTotal number of triangles = 4^6 * 4 = 16384 * 4 = 65536\n\nSo, there are 65,536 triangles in the 6th iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid construction."
