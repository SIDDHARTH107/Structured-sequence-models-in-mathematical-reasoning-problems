Connect vertices with the given degree sequence:\n\n   - A (degree 3) connects to B, C, and D.\n   - B (degree 3) connects to A, C, and E.\n   - C (degree 3) connects to A, B, and F.\n   - D (degree 2) connects to A and G.\n   - E (degree 2) connects to B and H.\n   - F (degree 1) connects to C.\n   - G (degree 1) connects to D.\n   - H (degree 1) connects to E.\n\nThe graph can be visualized as follows:\n\n```\n  A---B---E\n  |\\  |\n  | \\ |\n  D  \\C---F\n  |\n  G\n\n  H\n```\n\nThis graph has the desired degree sequence (3,3,3,2,2,1,1,1) and is a simple graph, as there are no loops or multiple edges between any pair of vertices."
