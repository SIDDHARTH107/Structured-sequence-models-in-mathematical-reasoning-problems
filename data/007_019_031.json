    "message_2": "The smallest prime factor of 450 is 2. \n\nTo find this, we can start by dividing 450 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:\n\n450 รท 2 = 225\n\nSince 225 is an odd number, we can't divide it by 2 again. The next smallest prime number is 3:\n\n225 รท 3 = 75\n\nWe could continue factoring, but we've already found the smallest prime factor, which is 2."
