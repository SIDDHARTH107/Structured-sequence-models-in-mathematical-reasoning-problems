    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system in matrix form. The matrix form is:\n\n[ 3  4  7 | 23 ]\n[-2  3  9 | 12 ]\n[ 5  2  4 | 15 ]\n\nNow, we need to convert this matrix into a sparse matrix representation. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, since there are no zero elements, we can't create a sparse matrix. However, we can still solve the system using Gaussian elimination or any other method for solving linear systems.\n\nLet's use Gaussian elimination:\n\n1. Swap row 1 and row 3:\n\n[ 5  2  4 | 15 ]\n[-2  3  9 | 12 ]\n[ 3  4  7 | 23 ]\n\n2. Divide row 1 by 5:\n\n[ 1  2/5  4/5 | 3 ]\n[-2  3    9 | 12 ]\n[ 3  4    7 | 23 ]\n\n3. Add 2 * row 1 to row 2:\n\n[ 1  2/5  4/5 | 3   ]\n[ 0  11/5  26/5 | 18 ]\n[ 3  4    7 | 23   ]\n\n4. Subtract 3 * row 1 from row 3:\n\n[ 1  2/5  4/5 | 3    ]\n[ 0  11/5  26/5 | 18  ]\n[ 0  14/5  13/5 | 14  ]\n\n5. Multiply row 2 by 5/11:\n\n[ 1  2/5  4/5 | 3    ]\n[ 0  1    13/11 | 30/11 ]\n[ 0  14/5  13/5 | 14  ]\n\n6. Subtract 14/5 * row 2 from row 3:\n\n[ 1  2/5  4/5 | 3      ]\n[ 0  1    13/11 | 30/11 ]\n[ 0  0    -1/11 | 2/11  ]\n\n7. Multiply row 3 by -11:\n\n[ 1  2/5  4/5 | 3 ]\n[ 0  1    13/11 | 30/11 ]\n[ 0  0    1 | -2 ]\n\n8. Subtract 13/11 * row 3 from row 2:\n\n[ 1  2/5  4/5 | 3 ]\n[ 0  1    0 | 4 ]\n[ 0  0    1 | -2 ]\n\n9. Subtract 4/5 * row 3 from row 1:\n\n[ 1  2/5  0 | 5 ]\n[ 0  1    0 | 4 ]\n[ 0  0    1 | -2 ]\n\n10. Subtract 2/5 * row 2 from row 1:\n\n[ 1  0  0 | -1 ]\n[ 0  1  0 | 4  ]\n[ 0  0  1 | -2 ]\n\nThe solution is x = -1, y = 4, and z = -2."
