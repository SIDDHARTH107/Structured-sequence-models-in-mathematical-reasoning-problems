    "message_2": "In a hyperbolic plane, the sum of the angles of a triangle is less than 180 degrees (π radians). The formula for the angle sum of a hyperbolic triangle is:\n\nSum of angles = π - A * |K| * (a² + b² + c²) / 2\n\nwhere A is the area of the triangle, K is the curvature, and a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle, all side lengths are equal (a = b = c = 5 units). The area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA = (a² * √3) / 4\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nA = (5² * √3) / 4 = 25√3 / 4\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of the angles:\n\nSum of angles = π - A * |K| * (a² + b² + c²) / 2\nSum of angles = π - (25√3 / 4) * |-2| * (5² + 5² + 5²) / 2\nSum of angles = π - (25√3 / 4) * 2 * (75) / 2\nSum of angles = π - 25√3\n\nSince it's an equilateral triangle, all angles are equal. Therefore, each angle can be calculated by dividing the sum of angles by 3:\n\nEach angle = (π - 25√3) / 3\n\nTo convert this to degrees, multiply by (180/π):\n\nEach angle = [(π - 25√3) / 3] * (180/π)\nEach angle ≈ 49.21 degrees\n\nSo, each angle of an equilateral triangle with side lengths of 5 units in a hyperbolic plane with a curvature of -2 is approximately 49.21 degrees."
