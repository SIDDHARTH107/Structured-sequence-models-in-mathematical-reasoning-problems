    "message_2": "The complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements that are not in set A. Since the intersection of a set and its complement contains the elements that are common to both sets, and there are no elements common to set A and its complement, the intersection of set A and its complement is an empty set.\n\nSo, A ∩ A' = ∅"
