    "message_2": "In the framework of Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT), the Euler characteristic of a closed oriented surface is an important topological invariant. For a closed oriented surface of genus g, the Euler characteristic (χ) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nFor a surface of genus 2, we can plug the value of g into the formula:\n\nχ = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of a closed oriented surface of genus 2 in the framework of Topological Quantum Field Theory is -2."
