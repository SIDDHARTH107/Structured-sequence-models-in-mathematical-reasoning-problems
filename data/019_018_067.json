    "message_2": "To prove the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM) for any mathematical statement `P`, we need to show that `P ∨ ¬P` is always true, given any `P`. \n\nThe Law of Excluded Middle states that for any proposition `P`, either `P` is true or its negation `¬P` is true. In other words, there is no middle ground between `P` and `¬P`. \n\nProof:\n\nConsider an arbitrary proposition `P`. There are two possibilities: \n\n1. `P` is true.\n2. `P` is false.\n\nIf `P` is true, then `P ∨ ¬P` is true because the disjunction `∨` is true if at least one of its components is true. In this case, `P` is true, so `P ∨ ¬P` is true.\n\nIf `P` is false, then its negation `¬P` is true. In this case, `P ∨ ¬P` is also true because the disjunction `∨` is true if at least one of its components is true. Since `¬P` is true, `P ∨ ¬P` is true.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that `P ∨ ¬P` is true. Therefore, the Law of Excluded Middle holds for any mathematical statement `P`."
