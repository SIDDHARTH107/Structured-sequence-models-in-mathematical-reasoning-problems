    "message_1": "A burger joint offers 4 different types of toppings for their burgers: lettuce, tomato, cheese, and onion. If a customer can choose any combination of toppings or no toppings at all, how many different types of burgers can be made?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of different types of burgers that can be made, we can use the formula for combinations with repetition, which is 2^n, where n is the number of toppings. In this case, n = 4.\n\n2^4 = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 different types of burgers that can be made, including the option with no toppings."
