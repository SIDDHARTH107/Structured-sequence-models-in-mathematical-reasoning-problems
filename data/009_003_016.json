    "message_1": "A metal rod with a length of 10 cm and a cross-sectional area of 5 cm^2 is heated on one end to a temperature of 100°C and kept at a constant temperature, while the opposite end is kept at a constant temperature of 50°C. The thermal conductivity of the rod is 50 W/mK and its specific heat capacity is 500 J/kgK. Assuming steady-state conditions, determine the temperature distribution along the rod and the rate of heat flow through the rod.",
    "message_2": "To determine the temperature distribution along the rod and the rate of heat flow through the rod, we can use Fourier's Law of heat conduction. Fourier's Law states that the rate of heat flow (Q) through a material is proportional to the negative gradient of the temperature and the area perpendicular to the direction of heat flow.\n\nQ = -k * A * (dT/dx)\n\nWhere:\nQ = rate of heat flow (W)\nk = thermal conductivity (W/mK)\nA = cross-sectional area (m^2)\ndT/dx = temperature gradient (K/m)\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\nLength of the rod (L) = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nCross-sectional area (A) = 5 cm^2 = 5 * 10^(-4) m^2\nThermal conductivity (k) = 50 W/mK\n\nThe temperature gradient (dT/dx) can be calculated as the change in temperature (ΔT) divided by the length of the rod (L):\n\ndT/dx = (T_hot - T_cold) / L\ndT/dx = (100°C - 50°C) / 0.1 m\ndT/dx = 50 K / 0.1 m\ndT/dx = 500 K/m\n\nNow we can use Fourier's Law to find the rate of heat flow (Q):\n\nQ = -k * A * (dT/dx)\nQ = -50 W/mK * 5 * 10^(-4) m^2 * 500 K/m\nQ = -25 W\n\nSince we have a negative value for Q, it means that the heat flow is in the opposite direction of the increasing x-coordinate, which is expected as heat flows from the hotter end to the colder end.\n\nNow, let's determine the temperature distribution along the rod. We can use the linear temperature distribution equation:\n\nT(x) = T_cold + (T_hot - T_cold) * (x / L)\n\nWhere:\nT(x) = temperature at a given point x along the rod\nT_cold = temperature at the cold end (50°C)\nT_hot = temperature at the hot end (100°C)\nx = distance from the cold end (0 ≤ x ≤ L)\nL = length of the rod (0.1 m)\n\nSo, the temperature distribution along the rod is given by:\n\nT(x) = 50°C + (100°C - 50°C) * (x / 0.1 m)\n\nT(x) = 50°C + 500°C/m * x\n\nThe temperature distribution along the rod is a linear function of the distance x from the cold end, with a slope of 500°C/m.\n\nIn conclusion, the rate of heat flow through the rod is 25 W (from the hot end to the cold end), and the temperature distribution along the rod is given by the equation T(x) = 50°C + 500°C/m * x."
