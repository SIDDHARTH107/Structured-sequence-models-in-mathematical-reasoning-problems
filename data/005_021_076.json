    "message_1": "Suppose you have a dataset consisting of 100 observations. Using bootstrapping, compute the 95% confidence interval for the population mean of the dataset assuming that the population is normally distributed with unknown population standard deviation based on a sample mean of 25 and a sample standard deviation of 4.5. Round your final answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To compute the 95% confidence interval for the population mean using bootstrapping, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the standard error of the sample mean.\n2. Determine the critical value for a 95% confidence interval.\n3. Calculate the margin of error.\n4. Compute the confidence interval.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the standard error of the sample mean\n\nStandard error (SE) = Sample standard deviation / sqrt(n)\nwhere n is the number of observations.\n\nSE = 4.5 / sqrt(100)\nSE = 4.5 / 10\nSE = 0.45\n\nStep 2: Determine the critical value for a 95% confidence interval\n\nSince the population standard deviation is unknown, we will use the t-distribution. For a 95% confidence interval and 99 degrees of freedom (n-1 = 100-1 = 99), the critical value (t*) is approximately 1.984.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the margin of error\n\nMargin of error (ME) = t* * SE\nME = 1.984 * 0.45\nME ≈ 0.89\n\nStep 4: Compute the confidence interval\n\nLower limit = Sample mean - ME\nLower limit = 25 - 0.89\nLower limit ≈ 24.11\n\nUpper limit = Sample mean + ME\nUpper limit = 25 + 0.89\nUpper limit ≈ 25.89\n\nTherefore, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean is approximately (24.11, 25.89), rounded to two decimal places."
