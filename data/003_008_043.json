    "message_1": "A rectangular-shaped garden has width 8 meters and the length is 11 meters. The owner wants to build a diagonal fence from one corner of the garden to the opposite corner. What will be the length of the diagonal fence in meters? Use trigonometry to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal fence, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the width and length of the garden form the two legs of the right-angled triangle, and the diagonal fence is the hypotenuse. Let's denote the width as a, the length as b, and the diagonal fence as c.\n\na = 8 meters\nb = 11 meters\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nSubstitute the values of a and b:\n\nc^2 = (8)^2 + (11)^2\nc^2 = 64 + 121\nc^2 = 185\n\nNow, to find the length of the diagonal fence (c), we need to take the square root of 185:\n\nc = √185 ≈ 13.60 meters\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal fence will be approximately 13.60 meters."
