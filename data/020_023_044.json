    "message_1": "Suppose you have $100,000 to invest in two stocks, A and B. The expected annual return for stock A is 12% and the standard deviation is 15%, while for stock B the expected return is 10% and the standard deviation is 10%. The correlation coefficient between the two stocks is 0.3. Determine the optimal portfolio allocation that maximizes the expected return while keeping the risk (measured by the standard deviation) at or below 8%.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal portfolio allocation, we need to find the weights of stocks A and B that maximize the expected return while keeping the risk at or below 8%. Let's denote the weight of stock A as x and the weight of stock B as (1-x).\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as follows:\n\nRp = x * Expected Return of A + (1-x) * Expected Return of B\nRp = x * 12% + (1-x) * 10%\n\nThe risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio (σp) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nσp^2 = x^2 * σA^2 + (1-x)^2 * σB^2 + 2 * x * (1-x) * ρAB * σA * σB\n\nwhere σA and σB are the standard deviations of stocks A and B, and ρAB is the correlation coefficient between the two stocks.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nσp^2 = x^2 * (15%)^2 + (1-x)^2 * (10%)^2 + 2 * x * (1-x) * 0.3 * 15% * 10%\n\nWe want to find the optimal allocation that keeps the risk at or below 8%, so we set σp = 8%:\n\n(8%)^2 = x^2 * (15%)^2 + (1-x)^2 * (10%)^2 + 2 * x * (1-x) * 0.3 * 15% * 10%\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n0.64 = 0.0225x^2 + 0.01(1-x)^2 + 0.09x(1-x)\n\n0.64 = 0.0225x^2 + 0.01(1-2x+x^2) + 0.09x - 0.09x^2\n\n0.64 = 0.0225x^2 + 0.01 - 0.02x + 0.01x^2 + 0.09x - 0.09x^2\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n0.64 = -0.0575x^2 + 0.07x + 0.01\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the expected return while keeping the risk at or below 8%. This can be done by taking the derivative of the expected return function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd(Rp)/dx = 12% - 10% = 0.02\n\nSince the derivative is constant, the expected return function is linear, and we just need to find the value of x that satisfies the risk constraint. We can plug the value of x back into the risk equation to verify that it meets the 8% risk constraint:\n\n-0.0575x^2 + 0.07x + 0.01 = 0.64\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx ≈ 0.4762\n\nTherefore, the optimal portfolio allocation is approximately 47.62% in stock A and 52.38% in stock B. This allocation maximizes the expected return while keeping the risk at or below 8%."
