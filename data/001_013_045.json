    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(2x+3) = 5, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root.\n(√(2x+3))^2 = 5^2\n\n2. Simplify both sides of the equation.\n2x + 3 = 25\n\n3. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation.\n2x = 22\n\n4. Divide both sides of the equation by 2.\nx = 11\n\nSo, the solution to the equation √(2x+3) = 5 is x = 11."
