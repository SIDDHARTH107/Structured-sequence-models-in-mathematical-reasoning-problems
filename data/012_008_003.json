    "message_2": "Euler's formula states that for any connected planar graph, the following relationship holds:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).\n\nIn this problem, we have a graph with V = 6 vertices and E = 8 edges. We want to determine if the graph is planar or not.\n\nTo do this, let's first find the maximum number of edges a planar graph can have. According to Kuratowski's theorem, a graph is planar if it does not contain a subgraph that is homeomorphic to K5 (complete graph with 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition). \n\nFor a graph with V vertices to be planar, it must have at most 3V - 6 edges. In our case, with 6 vertices, the maximum number of edges for a planar graph would be:\n\n3 * 6 - 6 = 18 - 6 = 12\n\nSince our graph has 8 edges, which is less than the maximum of 12 edges for a planar graph with 6 vertices, it is possible that the graph is planar. However, we still need to check if it satisfies Euler's formula.\n\nLet's assume the graph is planar and solve for F:\n\n6 - 8 + F = 2\nF = 4\n\nSince we got a positive integer value for F, the graph is indeed planar. It has 6 vertices, 8 edges, and 4 faces, satisfying Euler's formula."
