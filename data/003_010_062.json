    "message_1": "A tree stands 60 feet away from a building. An observer standing in front of the tree measures the angle of elevation to the top of the building to be 45 degrees. Assuming the observer's eye level is 5 feet above the ground, what is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We will first create a right triangle with the following points:\n\n- A: The point at the base of the tree (ground level)\n- B: The point at the observer's eye level (5 feet above the ground)\n- C: The point at the top of the building\n\nThe angle of elevation (45 degrees) is the angle formed by the line connecting point B to point C and the horizontal line connecting point A to point B. We are given the distance between point A and point B (60 feet) and the height of point B (5 feet). We want to find the height of point C (the height of the building).\n\nSince the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, we can use the tangent function to relate the height of the building (point C) to the distance between point A and point B (60 feet).\n\ntan(45) = (height of building - height of observer's eye level) / distance from tree to building\n\ntan(45) = (height of building - 5) / 60\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = (height of building - 5) / 60\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the building:\n\nheight of building - 5 = 60\n\nheight of building = 60 + 5\n\nheight of building = 65 feet\n\nSo, the height of the building is 65 feet."
