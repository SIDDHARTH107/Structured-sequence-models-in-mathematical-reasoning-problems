    "message_1": "Consider a centipede game where two players can either move left or right at each turn. The game has 6 rounds, and each player starts with 10 points. The payoffs in each round are as follows:\n\n- If both players move left, each player receives 2 points.\n- If both players move right, each player receives 1 point.\n- If one player moves left and the other moves right, the player who moved left receives 3 points, and the player who moved right receives 0 points.\n\nIf Player 1 moves left in the first round, and Player 2 moves right in the second round, what is the minimum number of points that Player 2 needs to win the game?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation after the first two rounds:\n\nRound 1: Player 1 moves left, Player 2 moves right.\nPoints: Player 1 has 13 points (10 + 3), Player 2 has 10 points (10 + 0).\n\nRound 2: Player 1 moves right, Player 2 moves right.\nPoints: Player 1 has 14 points (13 + 1), Player 2 has 11 points (10 + 1).\n\nNow, there are 4 rounds left. To minimize the points Player 2 needs to win, we should maximize the points Player 2 can get in the remaining rounds. The best case for Player 2 is to move left while Player 1 moves right in all remaining rounds.\n\nRound 3: Player 1 moves right, Player 2 moves left.\nPoints: Player 1 has 14 points (14 + 0), Player 2 has 14 points (11 + 3).\n\nRound 4: Player 1 moves right, Player 2 moves left.\nPoints: Player 1 has 14 points (14 + 0), Player 2 has 17 points (14 + 3).\n\nRound 5: Player 1 moves right, Player 2 moves left.\nPoints: Player 1 has 14 points (14 + 0), Player 2 has 20 points (17 + 3).\n\nRound 6: Player 1 moves right, Player 2 moves left.\nPoints: Player 1 has 14 points (14 + 0), Player 2 has 23 points (20 + 3).\n\nIn this scenario, Player 2 wins the game with 23 points, while Player 1 has 14 points. Therefore, the minimum number of points that Player 2 needs to win the game is 23."
