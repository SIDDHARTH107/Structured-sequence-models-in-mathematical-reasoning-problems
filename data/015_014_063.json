    "message_1": "During a 24-hour period, the temperature in a certain city varies randomly according to a chaotic system. The temperature at any given time is between 17°C and 25°C, and the temperature change from one time to the next is between -2°C and 2°C. If the temperature at midnight is 20°C, what is the probability that the temperature at 6 pm will be above 23°C?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use a Monte Carlo simulation, which is a method of estimating probabilities by running a large number of random experiments. In this case, we will simulate the temperature changes throughout the day and count the number of times the temperature at 6 pm is above 23°C.\n\n1. Set the initial temperature at midnight to 20°C.\n2. For each hour, generate a random temperature change between -2°C and 2°C.\n3. Add the temperature change to the current temperature and make sure it stays within the range of 17°C to 25°C.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for 18 hours (until 6 pm).\n5. Check if the temperature at 6 pm is above 23°C.\n6. Repeat steps 1-5 for a large number of trials (e.g., 10,000 or more).\n7. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of trials where the temperature at 6 pm was above 23°C by the total number of trials.\n\nNote that this method provides an approximation of the probability, and the accuracy will depend on the number of trials performed. The more trials you run, the more accurate the probability estimate will be."
