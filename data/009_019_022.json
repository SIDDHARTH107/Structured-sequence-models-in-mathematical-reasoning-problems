    "message_2": "To find the probability that $X_T > 15$, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). The given SDE is a geometric Brownian motion:\n\n$dX_t = aX_t dt + bX_t dW_t$\n\nApplying Ito's lemma, we can find the solution to this SDE. Let $Y_t = \\ln(X_t)$. Then, by Ito's lemma, we have:\n\n$dY_t = \\frac{1}{X_t} dX_t - \\frac{1}{2X_t^2} (bX_t)^2 dt$\n\nSubstituting the given SDE into this expression, we get:\n\n$dY_t = (a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2) dt + b dW_t$\n\nNow, we have a linear SDE for $Y_t$. Integrating both sides with respect to $t$ from 0 to $T$, we get:\n\n$Y_T - Y_0 = (a - \\frac{1}{2}b^2) T + b W_T$\n\nSince $Y_t = \\ln(X_t)$, we have $Y_0 = \\ln(X_0) = \\ln(10)$ and $Y_T = \\ln(X_T)$. Plugging in the given values for $a$, $b$, $X_0$, and $T$, we get:\n\n$\\ln(X_T) - \\ln(10) = (0.02 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.04)^2) (5) + 0.04 W_T$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_T > 15$. Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:\n\n$X_T = 10 \\exp((0.02 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.04)^2) (5) + 0.04 W_T)$\n\nSo, we want to find the probability that:\n\n$10 \\exp((0.02 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.04)^2) (5) + 0.04 W_T) > 15$\n\nDividing both sides by 10, we get:\n\n$\\exp((0.02 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.04)^2) (5) + 0.04 W_T) > 1.5$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n$(0.02 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.04)^2) (5) + 0.04 W_T > \\ln(1.5)$\n\nRearranging the inequality, we get:\n\n$W_T > \\frac{\\ln(1.5) - (0.02 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.04)^2) (5)}{0.04}$\n\nNow, we know that $W_T$ is a Brownian motion, which means that $W_T \\sim N(0, T)$. In our case, $T = 5$, so $W_T \\sim N(0, 5)$. Let $Z = \\frac{W_T}{\\sqrt{T}}$, then $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. We want to find the probability that:\n\n$Z > \\frac{\\frac{\\ln(1.5) - (0.02 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.04)^2) (5)}{0.04}}{\\sqrt{5}}$\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we can find the probability that a standard normal random variable is greater than this value:\n\n$P(Z > \\frac{\\frac{\\ln(1.5) - (0.02 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.04)^2) (5)}{0.04}}{\\sqrt{5}}) \\approx 0.036$\n\nSo, the probability that $X_T > 15$ is approximately 0.036 or 3.6%."
