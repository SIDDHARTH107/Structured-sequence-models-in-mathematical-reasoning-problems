    "message_2": "To simplify the expression √18 - 3√2, we first need to simplify the square root of 18.\n\n√18 can be written as √(9 * 2), since 9 * 2 = 18.\n\nNow, we can simplify further by taking the square root of 9, which is 3.\n\nSo, √18 = √(9 * 2) = 3√2.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the original expression as:\n\n3√2 - 3√2.\n\nSince both terms have the same square root, we can combine them:\n\n(3 - 3)√2 = 0√2 = 0.\n\nSo, the simplified form of √18 - 3√2 is 0."
