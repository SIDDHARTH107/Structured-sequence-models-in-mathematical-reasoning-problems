    "message_2": "First, we need to find the union of sets A and B, which is denoted as A U B. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements from both sets, without duplicates. In this case, A U B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nNext, we need to find the Cartesian product of (A U B) and C, denoted as (A U B) x C. The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of the first set and b is an element of the second set.\n\nSo, (A U B) x C = {(1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)}"
