    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Latin square of order 4, where each cell can take a value from 1 to 4. How many different Latin squares of order 4 can be formed?",
    "message_2": "A Latin square of order 4 is a 4x4 grid where each row and each column contains the numbers 1 to 4 exactly once. To count the number of different Latin squares of order 4, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in 4! (4 factorial) ways, as there are no restrictions on the placement of the numbers.\n\n2. For the second row, there are 3 possible placements for the number 1 (since it cannot be in the same column as the 1 in the first row). After placing the 1, there are 2 possible placements for the number 2, and then the remaining two numbers (3 and 4) have only one possible placement each. So, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to fill in the second row.\n\n3. For the third row, there are 2 possible placements for the number 1, and then 2 possible placements for the number 2. The remaining two numbers (3 and 4) have only one possible placement each. So, there are 2! (2 factorial) ways to fill in the third row.\n\n4. Once the first three rows are filled, the fourth row is determined, as there is only one possible placement for each number that satisfies the Latin square conditions.\n\nSo, the total number of different Latin squares of order 4 can be calculated as:\n\n4! × 3! × 2! = 24 × 6 × 2 = 288\n\nTherefore, there are 288 different Latin squares of order 4."
