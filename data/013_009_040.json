    "message_1": "Suppose that two players are playing the Matching Pennies game. Each player has two coins - one with a \"heads\" side and the other with a \"tails\" side. The game proceeds in the following way: \n\n- Each player chooses one of their two coins (without showing it to the other player) and places it heads-up or tails-up on the table. \n- Then, both coins are revealed and the players compare them. If the coins match (i.e., both heads or both tails), Player 1 wins and gets $1 from Player 2. If the coins do not match (i.e., one heads and one tails), Player 2 wins and gets $1 from Player 1.\n\nSuppose that the players decide to play this game repeatedly for 10 rounds. The first player decides to use their coins in a predictable pattern: heads, heads, tails, tails, heads, heads, tails, tails, heads, heads. \n\nWhat strategy should the second player use in order to maximize their expected winnings over these 10 rounds?",
    "message_2": "Since the first player is using a predictable pattern (heads, heads, tails, tails, heads, heads, tails, tails, heads, heads), the second player can simply choose their coins to counter this pattern and maximize their winnings. \n\nTo do this, the second player should choose the opposite of what the first player is choosing in each round. The second player's strategy should be: tails, tails, heads, heads, tails, tails, heads, heads, tails, tails.\n\nBy using this strategy, the second player will win every round, as their coin will never match the first player's coin. Thus, the second player will maximize their expected winnings over these 10 rounds, winning $1 in each round for a total of $10."
