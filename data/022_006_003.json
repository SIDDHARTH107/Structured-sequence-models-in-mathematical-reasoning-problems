    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum modulus of the function f(z) = z^3 - 4z^2 + 5z - 2 in the closed disc |z| <= 2, we will use the Maximum Modulus Principle. According to this principle, the maximum modulus of a holomorphic function on a closed and bounded domain occurs on the boundary of the domain.\n\nIn this case, the boundary of the domain is the circle |z| = 2. So, we will parameterize the boundary using z = 2e^(iθ), where θ ∈ [0, 2π].\n\nNow, let's substitute z = 2e^(iθ) into the function f(z):\n\nf(2e^(iθ)) = (2e^(iθ))^3 - 4(2e^(iθ))^2 + 5(2e^(iθ)) - 2\n= 8e^(3iθ) - 16e^(2iθ) + 10e^(iθ) - 2\n\nNow, we will find the modulus of f(2e^(iθ)):\n\n|f(2e^(iθ))| = |8e^(3iθ) - 16e^(2iθ) + 10e^(iθ) - 2|\n\nTo find the maximum and minimum of this expression, we can use calculus. However, it's easier to notice that the function is continuous and differentiable on the closed disc |z| <= 2. Therefore, we can use the Maximum Modulus Principle to find the maximum and minimum modulus on the boundary.\n\nThe maximum modulus will occur when the modulus of each term is maximized:\n\n|8e^(3iθ) - 16e^(2iθ) + 10e^(iθ) - 2| <= |8e^(3iθ)| + |16e^(2iθ)| + |10e^(iθ)| + |-2|\n= 8|e^(3iθ)| + 16|e^(2iθ)| + 10|e^(iθ)| + 2\n= 8(2^3) + 16(2^2) + 10(2) + 2\n= 64 + 64 + 20 + 2\n= 150\n\nThe minimum modulus will occur when the modulus of each term is minimized. Since the terms have different signs, we can try to find a θ that makes the terms cancel each other out as much as possible. We can experiment with different values of θ to find the minimum modulus. For example, we can try θ = π:\n\n|f(2e^(iπ))| = |8e^(3iπ) - 16e^(2iπ) + 10e^(iπ) - 2|\n= |-8 - 16(-1) + 10(-1) - 2|\n= |-8 + 16 - 10 - 2|\n= |-4|\n\nHowever, the modulus is always non-negative, so the minimum modulus is 0.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum modulus of the function f(z) = z^3 - 4z^2 + 5z - 2 in the closed disc |z| <= 2 is 150, and the minimum modulus is 0."
