    "message_2": "To solve this homogeneous system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, let's write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n| 1 -2  1 | 0\n| 2 -1 -1 | 0\n| 4 -3  1 | 0\n\nNow, let's perform the Gaussian elimination:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1 -2  1 | 0\n| 0  3 -3 | 0\n| 0  5 -3 | 0\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by 3:\n\n| 1 -2  1 | 0\n| 0  1 -1 | 0\n| 0  5 -3 | 0\n\nStep 3: Add 2 times the second row to the first row, and subtract 5 times the second row from the third row:\n\n| 1  0 -1 | 0\n| 0  1 -1 | 0\n| 0  0  2 | 0\n\nStep 4: Divide the third row by 2:\n\n| 1  0 -1 | 0\n| 0  1 -1 | 0\n| 0  0  1 | 0\n\nNow, let's write the system of linear equations corresponding to this matrix:\n\nx - z = 0\ny - z = 0\nz = 0\n\nFrom the third equation, we have z = 0. Substituting this value into the first and second equations, we get:\n\nx = 0\ny = 0\n\nSo, the solution to the homogeneous system of linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
