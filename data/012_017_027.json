    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices in the graph, with each vertex being part of exactly one edge in the matching. Since there are 6 vertices in the graph, a perfect matching must contain 3 edges.\n\nTo find the maximum number of edges that can be removed while still maintaining a perfect matching, we can look for a set of 3 edges that cover all vertices.\n\nOne possible perfect matching is the set of edges {(1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 6)}. This matching covers all vertices, and no vertex is part of more than one edge in the matching.\n\nSince we have found a perfect matching with 3 edges, we can remove the other 5 edges from the graph. Therefore, the maximum number of edges that can be removed while still maintaining a perfect matching is 5."
