    "message_2": "A monoalphabetic substitution cipher involves replacing each letter of the alphabet with another letter. To guess the substitution key correctly, you would need to guess the correct replacement for each of the 26 letters.\n\nSince there are 26 possible letters for each substitution, there are 26! (26 factorial) possible substitution keys. This is because there are 26 choices for the first letter, 25 choices for the second letter, 24 choices for the third letter, and so on, until there is only 1 choice for the last letter.\n\n26! = 26 × 25 × 24 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 ≈ 4.03 × 10^26\n\nTo find the probability of correctly guessing the substitution key, you would divide 1 by the total number of possible keys:\n\nProbability = 1 / (26!) ≈ 1 / (4.03 × 10^26)\n\nThe probability of correctly guessing a substitution key for a monoalphabetic substitution cipher with 26 possible letters is approximately 2.48 × 10^-28."
