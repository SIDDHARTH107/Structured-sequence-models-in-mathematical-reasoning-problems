Group A received no fertilizer, Group B received a standard fertilizer, and Group C received an experimental fertilizer. After 8 weeks, the heights of the plants were measured. \n\nHere is the summarized data:\n\n- Group A: Mean = 10, Variance = 9\n- Group B: Mean = 20, Variance = 16\n- Group C: Mean = 30, Variance = 25\n\nIs there a significant difference in the mean plant height between the three groups? Use a significance level of 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To determine if there is a significant difference in the mean plant height between the three groups, we can perform a one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference in the mean plant height between the three groups, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant difference.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the overall mean (Grand Mean) of the plant heights:\n\nGrand Mean = (Mean of Group A + Mean of Group B + Mean of Group C) / 3\nGrand Mean = (10 + 20 + 30) / 3\nGrand Mean = 60 / 3\nGrand Mean = 20\n\nNow, we need to calculate the Sum of Squares Between (SSB), Sum of Squares Within (SSW), and the total Sum of Squares (SST).\n\nSSB = Σn_i (Mean_i - Grand Mean)^2\nSSB = 10(10 - 20)^2 + 10(20 - 20)^2 + 10(30 - 20)^2\nSSB = 10(-10)^2 + 10(0)^2 + 10(10)^2\nSSB = 1000 + 0 + 1000\nSSB = 2000\n\nSSW = Σ(n_i - 1) * Variance_i\nSSW = (10 - 1) * 9 + (10 - 1) * 16 + (10 - 1) * 25\nSSW = 9 * 9 + 9 * 16 + 9 * 25\nSSW = 81 + 144 + 225\nSSW = 450\n\nSST = SSB + SSW\nSST = 2000 + 450\nSST = 2450\n\nNow, we need to calculate the Mean Squares Between (MSB), Mean Squares Within (MSW), and the F-statistic.\n\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1), where k is the number of groups\nMSB = 2000 / (3 - 1)\nMSB = 2000 / 2\nMSB = 1000\n\nMSW = SSW / (N - k), where N is the total number of plants\nMSW = 450 / (30 - 3)\nMSW = 450 / 27\nMSW = 16.67\n\nF-statistic = MSB / MSW\nF-statistic = 1000 / 16.67\nF-statistic ≈ 60\n\nNow, we need to find the critical F-value for a significance level of 0.05. Using an F-distribution table or calculator, with degrees of freedom between groups (df1) = 2 and degrees of freedom within groups (df2) = 27, we find the critical F-value to be approximately 3.35.\n\nSince our calculated F-statistic (60) is greater than the critical F-value (3.35), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean plant height between the three groups at a significance level of 0.05."
