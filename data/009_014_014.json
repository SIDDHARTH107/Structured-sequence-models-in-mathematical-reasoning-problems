    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the logistic growth model formula:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r*t))\n\nwhere:\nP(t) is the population at time t,\nP0 is the initial population,\nK is the carrying capacity,\nr is the growth rate, and\nt is the time in months.\n\nWe are given:\nP0 = 50 (initial population),\nK = 500 (carrying capacity),\nthe population doubles every 6 months, so P(6) = 2 * P0 = 100, and\nt = 2 years = 24 months (we want to find the population after 2 years).\n\nFirst, let's find the growth rate r. We can use the formula and the fact that the population doubles every 6 months:\n\n100 = 500 / (1 + (500 - 50) / 50 * e^(-r*6))\n\nNow, let's solve for r:\n\n100 = 500 / (1 + 450 / 50 * e^(-6r))\n1 + 450 / 50 * e^(-6r) = 500 / 100\n1 + 9 * e^(-6r) = 5\n9 * e^(-6r) = 4\ne^(-6r) = 4 / 9\n-6r = ln(4 / 9)\nr = -ln(4 / 9) / 6 ≈ 0.0952\n\nNow that we have the growth rate r, we can find the population after 2 years (t = 24 months):\n\nP(24) = 500 / (1 + (500 - 50) / 50 * e^(-0.0952*24))\n\nP(24) = 500 / (1 + 450 / 50 * e^(-2.2848))\nP(24) = 500 / (1 + 9 * e^(-2.2848))\nP(24) = 500 / (1 + 9 * 0.1019)\nP(24) = 500 / (1 + 0.9171)\nP(24) = 500 / 1.9171\nP(24) ≈ 260.6\n\nAfter 2 years, the population of rabbits will be approximately 261 (rounded to the nearest whole number)."
