    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v(2, -1, 3) along the curve C from r(0) to r(1), we need to solve the following equation:\n\n∇_r(t) v(t) = 0\n\nwhere ∇_r(t) is the covariant derivative along the curve C, and v(t) is the transported vector at time t.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector to the curve C, which is the derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\n\nr'(t) = (3, 8t, 3t^2)\n\nNow, let's find the covariant derivative of v(t) along the curve C. We have:\n\n∇_r(t) v(t) = (∇_r(t) v_x(t), ∇_r(t) v_y(t), ∇_r(t) v_z(t))\n\nwhere v_x(t), v_y(t), and v_z(t) are the components of v(t).\n\nThe covariant derivative of a scalar function along a curve is given by:\n\n∇_r(t) f(t) = f'(t) * r'(t)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n∇_r(t) v_x(t) = v_x'(t) * r'(t)\n∇_r(t) v_y(t) = v_y'(t) * r'(t)\n∇_r(t) v_z(t) = v_z'(t) * r'(t)\n\nNow, let's set the covariant derivative to zero:\n\nv_x'(t) * r'(t) = 0\nv_y'(t) * r'(t) = 0\nv_z'(t) * r'(t) = 0\n\nSince r'(t) ≠ 0, we can divide by r'(t):\n\nv_x'(t) = 0\nv_y'(t) = 0\nv_z'(t) = 0\n\nIntegrating these equations with respect to t, we get:\n\nv_x(t) = A\nv_y(t) = B\nv_z(t) = C\n\nwhere A, B, and C are constants.\n\nAt t = 0, we have the initial vector v(2, -1, 3):\n\nv_x(0) = A = 2\nv_y(0) = B = -1\nv_z(0) = C = 3\n\nSo, the transported vector v(t) is:\n\nv(t) = (2, -1, 3)\n\nSince the vector does not change along the curve, the parallel transport of the vector v(2, -1, 3) along the curve C from r(0) to r(1) is:\n\nv(1) = (2, -1, 3)"
