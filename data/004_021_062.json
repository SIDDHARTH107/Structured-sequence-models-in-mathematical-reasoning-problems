    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^5 - 3x^3 + 4x, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x), which will be the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nFirst derivative:\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we have:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^5)/dx - d(3x^3)/dx + d(4x)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 2 * 5 * x^(5-1) - 3 * 3 * x^(3-1) + 4 * 1 * x^(1-1)\n\nf'(x) = 10x^4 - 9x^2 + 4\n\nNow, we'll find the second derivative, f''(x):\n\nf''(x) = d(10x^4)/dx - d(9x^2)/dx + d(4)/dx\n\nf''(x) = 10 * 4 * x^(4-1) - 9 * 2 * x^(2-1) + 0\n\nf''(x) = 40x^3 - 18x\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^5 - 3x^3 + 4x is f''(x) = 40x^3 - 18x."
