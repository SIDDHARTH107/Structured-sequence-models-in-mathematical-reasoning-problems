    "message_1": "A company claims that their energy drink increases productivity by at least 10%. To test this claim, a sample of 50 employees is selected, and each participant's productivity is measured before and after consuming the energy drink. The mean productivity score before consuming the energy drink is 80, with a standard deviation of 20. After consuming the energy drink, the mean productivity score is 92. Conduct a hypothesis test at a 5% significance level to determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the company's claim.",
    "message_2": "To test the company's claim, we will conduct a paired t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference in productivity after consuming the energy drink, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant increase in productivity of at least 10%.\n\nH0: μd = 0\nH1: μd > 0\n\nHere, μd represents the mean difference in productivity scores before and after consuming the energy drink.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean difference (d̄) and the standard deviation of the differences (sd).\n\nd̄ = (Σd) / n = (Σ(before - after)) / 50\n\nSince we don't have individual data, we can use the given means and assume that the mean difference is 12 (92 - 80).\n\nd̄ = 12\n\nStep 2: Calculate the standard error of the mean difference (SEd).\n\nSEd = sd / √n\n\nWe are given the standard deviation of the productivity scores before consuming the energy drink (20). We will assume that the standard deviation of the differences is also 20.\n\nSEd = 20 / √50 ≈ 2.83\n\nStep 3: Calculate the t-statistic.\n\nt = (d̄ - μd) / SEd = (12 - 0) / 2.83 ≈ 4.24\n\nStep 4: Determine the critical t-value for a one-tailed test at a 5% significance level with 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1).\n\nUsing a t-table or calculator, the critical t-value is approximately 1.677.\n\nStep 5: Compare the t-statistic to the critical t-value.\n\nSince the t-statistic (4.24) is greater than the critical t-value (1.677), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion: There is sufficient evidence at a 5% significance level to support the company's claim that their energy drink increases productivity by at least 10%."
