    "message_1": "Suppose you own a factory that produces two types of products: A and B. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, while each unit of product B requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time. You have 200 hours of labor and 150 hours of machine time available per week. If the profit for each unit of A is $50 and B is $60, how many units of each product should you produce to maximize your profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal combination of units of product A and B to produce. Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and machine time are as follows:\n\nLabor: 2x + 3y ≤ 200\nMachine time: x + 2y ≤ 150\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 50x + 60y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first solve the constraint inequalities for the feasible region:\n\n1) 2x + 3y ≤ 200\ny ≤ (200 - 2x) / 3\n\n2) x + 2y ≤ 150\ny ≤ (150 - x) / 2\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the intersection of these inequalities, along with x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.\n\nNow, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1) Intersection of x = 0 and y = 0: (0, 0)\n2) Intersection of x = 0 and y = (150 - x) / 2: (0, 75)\n3) Intersection of y = 0 and y = (200 - 2x) / 3: (100, 0)\n4) Intersection of y = (200 - 2x) / 3 and y = (150 - x) / 2:\n\n(200 - 2x) / 3 = (150 - x) / 2\n400 - 4x = 450 - 3x\nx = 50\n\ny = (150 - 50) / 2 = 50\n\nSo, the intersection point is (50, 50).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1) Profit(0, 0) = 50(0) + 60(0) = $0\n2) Profit(0, 75) = 50(0) + 60(75) = $4500\n3) Profit(100, 0) = 50(100) + 60(0) = $5000\n4) Profit(50, 50) = 50(50) + 60(50) = $5500\n\nThe maximum profit is $5500, which occurs when producing 50 units of product A and 50 units of product B."
