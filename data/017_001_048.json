    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4 with elements {e, a, b, c}, where e is the identity element and a, b, and c have order 2. We want to show that G is isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4 = {e, A, B, C}, where A, B, and C also have order 2 and AB = BA = C, AC = CA = B, BC = CB = A.\n\nSince a, b, and c have order 2, we have the following equations:\n\n1. a^2 = e\n2. b^2 = e\n3. c^2 = e\n\nNow, let's consider the product ab. Since G is a group, the product ab must be an element of G. We have the following possibilities for the product ab:\n\n1. ab = e\n2. ab = a\n3. ab = b\n4. ab = c\n\nWe can eliminate the first possibility (ab = e) because if ab = e, then a = b^(-1) = b, which contradicts the assumption that a, b, and c are distinct elements.\n\nWe can also eliminate the second possibility (ab = a) because if ab = a, then b = e, which contradicts the assumption that b has order 2.\n\nSimilarly, we can eliminate the third possibility (ab = b) because if ab = b, then a = e, which contradicts the assumption that a has order 2.\n\nSo, we are left with the fourth possibility, which is ab = c. Now, let's consider the product ac. By the same reasoning as above, we can eliminate the possibilities ac = e, ac = a, and ac = b. So, we have ac = b.\n\nFinally, let's consider the product bc. Again, by the same reasoning, we can eliminate the possibilities bc = e, bc = b, and bc = c. So, we have bc = a.\n\nNow, we have shown that the group G has the following properties:\n\n1. a^2 = e\n2. b^2 = e\n3. c^2 = e\n4. ab = c\n5. ac = b\n6. bc = a\n\nThese properties are exactly the same as the properties of the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4."
