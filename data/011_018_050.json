    "message_2": "In a sports league with 10 teams, each team plays every other team exactly once. To find the total number of games played, we can use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of teams (10) and k is the number of teams playing in each game (2).\n\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!)\nC(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!)\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9 * 8!)/(2 * 8!)\nC(10, 2) = (10 * 9)/2\nC(10, 2) = 90/2\nC(10, 2) = 45\n\nSo, there are 45 games played in the league."
