    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A × B) and B:\n\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)} △ {3, 4, 5}\n\nSince the elements of B are not pairs, they are not present in (A × B). Therefore, the symmetric difference remains the same as (A × B):\n\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (B × A) and B:\n\n(B × A) △ B = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)} △ {3, 4, 5}\n\nSimilarly, since the elements of B are not pairs, they are not present in (B × A). Therefore, the symmetric difference remains the same as (B × A):\n\n(B × A) △ B = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare (A × B) △ B and (B × A) △ B:\n\n(A × B) △ B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n(B × A) △ B = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) △ B and (B × A) △ B are not equal. This shows that the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
