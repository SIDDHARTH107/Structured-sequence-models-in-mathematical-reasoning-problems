    "message_2": "The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 150 and 225 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm or by factoring the numbers and finding the highest common factor.\n\nFactoring method:\n150 = 2 × 3 × 5²\n225 = 3² × 5²\n\nThe common factors are 3 and 5². Multiplying these common factors gives the GCD:\n\nGCD(150, 225) = 3 × 5² = 3 × 25 = 75"
