    "message_2": "To solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional box, we first need to set up the equation. The potential energy inside the box is zero, and the wave function must be zero at the boundaries of the box (x = 0 and x = L). The time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is:\n\n(-ħ² / 2m) * (d²ψ(x) / dx²) = E * ψ(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the mass of the particle, E is the energy, and ψ(x) is the wave function.\n\nThe general solution to this equation is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions:\n\nψ(x) = A * sin(kx) + B * cos(kx)\n\nwhere A and B are constants and k is the wave number.\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\nψ(0) = A * sin(0) + B * cos(0) = B = 0 (since the wave function must be zero at x = 0)\n\nψ(L) = A * sin(kL) = 0 (since the wave function must be zero at x = L)\n\nFor non-trivial solutions (A ≠ 0), we must have:\n\nsin(kL) = 0\n\nThis implies that kL = nπ, where n is an integer. Therefore, the wave number k can be expressed as:\n\nk = nπ / L\n\nNow, we can relate the wave number k to the energy E using the following equation:\n\nE = (ħ² * k²) / (2m)\n\nSubstituting k = nπ / L, we get:\n\nE = (ħ² * (nπ / L)²) / (2m)\n\nFor the lowest energy level, we take n = 1:\n\nE₁ = (ħ² * (π / L)²) / (2m)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values for the mass (m = 0.3 kg) and the length of the box (L = 0.5 m), as well as the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J s):\n\nE₁ = ((1.0545718 × 10⁻³⁴ J s)² * (π / 0.5 m)²) / (2 * 0.3 kg)\n\nE₁ ≈ 6.02497 × 10⁻³⁴ J\n\nSo, the lowest energy level for the particle in the one-dimensional box is approximately 6.02497 × 10⁻³⁴ J."
