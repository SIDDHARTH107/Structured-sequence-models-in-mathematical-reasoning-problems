    "message_2": "First, let's find the intersection of A and B, which is denoted as A ∩ B. Since A contains only numbers and B contains only letters, there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, A ∩ B = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) x A. Since A ∩ B is an empty set, the Cartesian product will also be an empty set. So, (A ∩ B) x A = ∅.\n\nNext, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A. \n\nA x B = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)}\nB x A = {(a, 1), (a, 2), (b, 1), (b, 2), (c, 1), (c, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A x B and B x A, which is denoted as A x B ∩ B x A. Comparing the two sets of ordered pairs, we can see that there are no common elements between them. Therefore, A x B ∩ B x A = ∅ (the empty set).\n\nIn conclusion, (A ∩ B) x A = ∅ and A x B ∩ B x A = ∅."
