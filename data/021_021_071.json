    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nMaximize the function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 9 using the cuckoo search algorithm. Start with an initial population of 10 solutions, a maximum of 100 iterations, a step size of 0.01 and a probability of discovering a new nest (i.e. a new solution) of 0.25. Use the golden section search method to find the step size that produces the best results. Report the maximum value of f(x) obtained and the value of x that produced it.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the cuckoo search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the population of 10 solutions (nests) randomly.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest (solution) using the function f(x).\n3. Perform the cuckoo search algorithm with the given parameters (100 iterations, step size of 0.01, and probability of discovering a new nest of 0.25).\n4. Use the golden section search method to find the optimal step size.\n5. Report the maximum value of f(x) and the value of x that produced it.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I am unable to execute code or perform iterative calculations. I can provide you with a general outline of the cuckoo search algorithm and the golden section search method.\n\nCuckoo Search Algorithm:\n1. Generate an initial population of n nests (solutions) randomly.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each nest.\n3. While the stopping criteria are not met (e.g., maximum iterations):\n   a. Choose a nest randomly and generate a new solution by adding a step size multiplied by a random number to the chosen nest.\n   b. Evaluate the fitness of the new solution.\n   c. If the new solution is better than the worst nest in the population, replace the worst nest with the new solution.\n   d. With a probability p, choose a nest randomly and replace it with a new randomly generated solution.\n   e. Evaluate the fitness of the new nest.\n   f. Update the best solution found so far.\n4. Return the best solution found.\n\nGolden Section Search Method:\n1. Define the search interval [a, b] and calculate the golden ratio.\n2. Calculate the two interior points x1 and x2 using the golden ratio.\n3. Evaluate the function f(x) at x1 and x2.\n4. While the stopping criteria are not met (e.g., desired accuracy):\n   a. If f(x1) > f(x2), update the search interval to [a, x2], and calculate the new x1 and x2.\n   b. If f(x1) < f(x2), update the search interval to [x1, b], and calculate the new x1 and x2.\n   c. Evaluate the function f(x) at the new x1 and x2.\n5. Return the optimal step size found.\n\nAfter performing these steps, you will obtain the maximum value of f(x) and the value of x that produced it. Note that the given function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 9 is a quadratic function with a minimum value, not a maximum. To find the minimum value, you can change the function to g(x) = -f(x) = -x^2 + 6x - 9 and apply the same algorithm to maximize g(x). The minimum value of f(x) will be the negative of the maximum value of g(x)."
