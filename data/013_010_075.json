The cost of production for both companies is $40 per unit. In this Cournot competition, each company must decide how much to produce, with the understanding that the total amount produced by both companies cannot exceed 100 units. If each company assumes that the other company will produce half of the total demand, what will be the equilibrium quantity produced by each company?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantity produced by each company in this Cournot competition, we need to first determine the market demand function. Let's assume the market demand function is given by P = a - bQ, where P is the price, Q is the total quantity produced by both companies, and a and b are constants. \n\nSince the total demand is 100 units and the cost of production is $40 per unit, we can find the price when the total quantity produced is 100 units. At this point, the price should be equal to the cost of production:\n\n40 = a - b(100)\n\nNow, let's assume that each company believes the other will produce half of the total demand (50 units). In this case, Company A will produce 50 units, and Company B will also produce 50 units. The total quantity produced will be 100 units, and the price will be $40 per unit.\n\nTo find the equilibrium quantity produced by each company, we need to find their reaction functions. The reaction function for Company A is given by:\n\nqA = (a - cA - bqB) / (2b)\n\nSimilarly, the reaction function for Company B is given by:\n\nqB = (a - cB - bqA) / (2b)\n\nSince both companies have the same cost of production, cA = cB = 40. We can plug these values into the reaction functions:\n\nqA = (a - 40 - bqB) / (2b)\nqB = (a - 40 - bqA) / (2b)\n\nNow, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the equilibrium quantities produced by each company. Plugging qA into the equation for qB:\n\nqB = (a - 40 - b((a - 40 - bqB) / (2b))) / (2b)\n\nSimplifying and solving for qB:\n\nqB = (a - 40) / (3b)\n\nNow, plugging qB back into the equation for qA:\n\nqA = (a - 40 - b((a - 40) / (3b))) / (2b)\n\nSimplifying and solving for qA:\n\nqA = (a - 40) / (3b)\n\nSince both companies are symmetric, qA = qB. Therefore, the equilibrium quantity produced by each company is (a - 40) / (3b).\n\nNow, we need to find the values of a and b. We know that when the total quantity produced is 100 units, the price is $40:\n\n40 = a - b(100)\n\nUsing the equilibrium quantities, we can write the total quantity produced as:\n\nQ = qA + qB = 2((a - 40) / (3b))\n\nPlugging Q = 100 into the equation:\n\n100 = 2((a - 40) / (3b))\n\nSolving for a:\n\na = 40 + b(100)\n\nNow, we can plug this value of a back into the equation 40 = a - b(100):\n\n40 = (40 + b(100)) - b(100)\n\nSolving for b:\n\nb = 1\n\nNow, plugging b = 1 back into the equation for a:\n\na = 40 + 1(100) = 140\n\nNow that we have the values of a and b, we can find the equilibrium quantities produced by each company:\n\nqA = qB = (a - 40) / (3b) = (140 - 40) / (3 * 1) = 100 / 3 â‰ˆ 33.33 units\n\nSo, in the Cournot competition, each company will produce approximately 33.33 units at equilibrium."
