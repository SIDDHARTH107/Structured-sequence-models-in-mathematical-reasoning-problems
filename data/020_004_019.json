    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 2x^2 + 6x + 10, we first find the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a quadratic function in the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula:\n\nx_vertex = -b / (2a)\n\nIn our case, a = 2 and b = 6, so:\n\nx_vertex = -6 / (2 * 2) = -6 / 4 = -3/2\n\nNow, we need to check if the vertex is within the constraint x ≤ 5. Since -3/2 is less than 5, the vertex is within the constraint.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging the x_vertex into the function:\n\nf(-3/2) = 2(-3/2)^2 + 6(-3/2) + 10\nf(-3/2) = 2(9/4) - 9 + 10\nf(-3/2) = 9/2 - 9 + 10\nf(-3/2) = 9/2 + 1/2\nf(-3/2) = 10/2\nf(-3/2) = 5\n\nSo, the minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 2x^2 + 6x + 10 subject to the constraint x ≤ 5 is 5."
