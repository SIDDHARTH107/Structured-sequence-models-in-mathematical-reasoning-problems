The direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2, C4 x C2\n\nNow, let's show that each group of order 8 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4.\n\nLet G be a group of order 8. By the Sylow theorems, G has a normal subgroup of order 4, say H. If H is cyclic, then H is isomorphic to C4. In this case, G is an extension of H by a group of order 2. There are two possibilities:\n\n1. G is a semidirect product of H and a group of order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4.\n2. G is a direct product of H and a group of order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product C4 x C2.\n\nIf H is not cyclic, then H is isomorphic to C2 x C2. In this case, G is an extension of H by a group of order 2. There are two possibilities:\n\n1. G is a semidirect product of H and a group of order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n2. G is a direct product of H and a group of order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product C2 x C2 x C2.\n\nFinally, if G is cyclic, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8.\n\nThus, any group of order 8 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4."
