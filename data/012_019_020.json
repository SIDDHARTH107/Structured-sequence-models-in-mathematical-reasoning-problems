    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph G, denoted by χ'(G), is the smallest number of colors needed to properly color the edges of G such that no two adjacent edges share the same color. \n\nFirst, let's find the maximum degree of the graph G, denoted by Δ(G). Since there are 25 edges and 10 vertices, the average degree of the vertices is (2 * 25) / 10 = 5. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex with degree greater than or equal to 5. So, Δ(G) ≥ 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the two possibilities for the chromatic index:\n\n1. χ'(G) = Δ(G): In this case, the chromatic index would be equal to the maximum degree of the graph. Since Δ(G) ≥ 5, we would need at least 5 colors to properly color the edges.\n\n2. χ'(G) = Δ(G) + 1: In this case, the chromatic index would be one more than the maximum degree of the graph. This situation occurs when the graph has an odd number of vertices with odd degree (i.e., it is not possible to properly color the edges using only Δ(G) colors). \n\nTo determine which case applies to our graph, we need to check if there is an odd number of vertices with odd degree. Since the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges, we have:\n\nSum of degrees = 2 * 25 = 50\n\nIf there is an odd number of vertices with odd degree, the sum of degrees would be odd. However, the sum of degrees is 50, which is even. Therefore, there must be an even number of vertices with odd degree, and we can properly color the edges using only Δ(G) colors.\n\nThus, the chromatic index of the graph G is χ'(G) = Δ(G) = 5."
