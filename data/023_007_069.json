    "message_1": "In a Fourier analysis of a signal, the amplitude of the fundamental frequency is 8 and the amplitude of the second harmonic is 2. Determine the total amplitude of the signal.",
    "message_2": "In a Fourier analysis, the total amplitude of a signal is determined by calculating the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual amplitudes of its harmonics. In this case, we have two harmonics: the fundamental frequency with an amplitude of 8 and the second harmonic with an amplitude of 2.\n\nTotal amplitude = √(Amplitude1^2 + Amplitude2^2)\nTotal amplitude = √(8^2 + 2^2)\nTotal amplitude = √(64 + 4)\nTotal amplitude = √68\nTotal amplitude ≈ 8.246\n\nSo, the total amplitude of the signal is approximately 8.246."
