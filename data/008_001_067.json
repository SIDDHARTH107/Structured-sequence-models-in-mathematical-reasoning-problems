    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix methods, we first need to represent the given system of equations in the form of AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nThe given system of equations can be written as:\n\n1x - 1y + 1z = 5\n2x + 1y + 1z = 0\n1x + 2y - 1z = 4\n\nNow, we can represent this system in the form of AX = B:\n\nA = | 1 -1  1 |\n    | 2  1  1 |\n    | 1  2 -1 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  5 |\n    |  0 |\n    |  4 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv) and then multiply it with matrix B to get the values of x, y, and z.\n\nA_inv * A * X = A_inv * B\nX = A_inv * B\n\nFirst, we need to find the determinant of matrix A (det(A)):\n\ndet(A) = 1(1(-1) - 1(2)) - (-1)(2(-1) - 1(1)) + 1(2(1) - 1(1))\ndet(A) = 1(-1 - 2) - (-1)(-2 - 1) + 1(2 - 1)\ndet(A) = 1(-3) - (-1)(-3) + 1(1)\ndet(A) = -3 + 3 + 1\ndet(A) = 1\n\nSince det(A) is not equal to 0, the inverse of matrix A exists. Now, we can find the inverse of matrix A (A_inv):\n\nA_inv = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nadj(A) is the adjugate of matrix A, which is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors of A:\n\nadj(A) = |  1  3 -1 |\n         | -2 -1  1 |\n         |  1 -1  1 |\n\nNow, we can find A_inv:\n\nA_inv = (1/1) * adj(A)\nA_inv = |  1  3 -1 |\n        | -2 -1  1 |\n        |  1 -1  1 |\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z by multiplying A_inv with B:\n\nX = A_inv * B\nX = |  1  3 -1 |   |  5 |\n    | -2 -1  1 | * |  0 |\n    |  1 -1  1 |   |  4 |\n\nX = | (1*5) + (3*0) + (-1*4) |\n    | (-2*5) + (-1*0) + (1*4) |\n    | (1*5) + (-1*0) + (1*4) |\n\nX = | 5 - 4 |\n    | -10 + 4 |\n    | 5 + 4 |\n\nX = | 1 |\n    | -6 |\n    | 9 |\n\nSo, the values of x, y, and z that satisfy the given system of equations are:\n\nx = 1\ny = -6\nz = 9"
