    "message_2": "To find the local minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6)\n\nUsing the power rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nNow, we need to find the critical points by setting f'(x) = 0:\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nTo apply Newton's method, we need to find the second derivative of the function f(x):\n\nf''(x) = d^2/dx^2 (x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6)\n\nTaking the derivative of f'(x), we get:\n\nf''(x) = 6x - 12\n\nNow, let's apply Newton's method to find the critical points. Newton's method formula is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nWe need an initial guess (x_0) to start the iteration. Let's choose x_0 = 1 (you can choose any other reasonable value):\n\nx_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0)\nx_1 = 1 - (3(1)^2 - 12(1) + 11) / (6(1) - 12)\nx_1 = 1 - (-2) / (-6)\nx_1 = 1 + 1/3\nx_1 = 4/3\n\nNow, let's perform another iteration:\n\nx_2 = x_1 - f'(x_1) / f''(x_1)\nx_2 = 4/3 - (3(4/3)^2 - 12(4/3) + 11) / (6(4/3) - 12)\nx_2 ≈ 1.999\n\nWe can continue iterating until the difference between consecutive x values is very small, but for this problem, two iterations are enough to get a good approximation.\n\nNow, we have a critical point at x ≈ 1.999. To determine if this is a local minimum, we need to check the concavity of the function at this point using the second derivative:\n\nf''(1.999) ≈ 6(1.999) - 12 ≈ 0.994\n\nSince f''(1.999) > 0, the function is concave up at this point, which means we have a local minimum.\n\nFinally, to find the local minimum value of the function, we plug the critical point back into the original function:\n\nf(1.999) ≈ (1.999)^3 - 6(1.999)^2 + 11(1.999) - 6 ≈ 0.999\n\nSo, the local minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 is approximately 0.999."
