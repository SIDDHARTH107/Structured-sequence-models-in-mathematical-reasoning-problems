    "message_1": "A Ferris wheel with a diameter of 40 meters rotates at a rate of one revolution per minute. Find the maximum height of a passenger above the ground in meters, assuming that the passenger boards the Ferris wheel at its lowest point.",
    "message_2": "The diameter of the Ferris wheel is 40 meters, so the radius is half of that, which is 20 meters. When a passenger boards the Ferris wheel at its lowest point, they are already at a height equal to the radius above the ground. As the Ferris wheel rotates, the passenger will reach the highest point, which is the diameter above the ground.\n\nSo, the maximum height of a passenger above the ground is equal to the diameter of the Ferris wheel, which is 40 meters."
