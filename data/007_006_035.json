    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 42 and 56 using the Euclidean algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (56) by the smaller number (42) and find the remainder.\n   56 รท 42 = 1 with a remainder of 14.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (56) with the smaller number (42) and the smaller number with the remainder (14).\n   Now we have 42 and 14.\n\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the remainder is 0.\n   42 รท 14 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which in this case is 14.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 42 and 56 is 14."
