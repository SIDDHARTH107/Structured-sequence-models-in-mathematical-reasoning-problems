    "message_2": "First, let's express the given statement using predicate logic:\n\n∃x ∈ ℝ (x^2 = 2)\n\nNow, let's express the assertion using predicate logic:\n\n∀x ∈ ℝ ((x^2 = 2) → (x is irrational))\n\nTo evaluate the truth value of this assertion, we need to determine if the implication holds for every real number x. We know that there exist two real numbers, x = √2 and x = -√2, that satisfy the condition x^2 = 2. Both of these numbers are irrational, as they cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.\n\nTherefore, the assertion is true, as for every real number x, if x squared is equal to 2, then x is indeed irrational.\n\nThe conclusion we can draw from the truth value of this assertion is that the square root of 2 and its negative counterpart are both irrational numbers, and there are no rational numbers whose square is equal to 2."
