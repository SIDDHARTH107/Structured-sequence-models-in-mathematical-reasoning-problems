To check if this graph is planar, we can use the inequality derived from Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n20 ≤ 3(10) - 6\n20 ≤ 30 - 6\n20 ≤ 24\n\nSince the inequality is not satisfied (20 is not less than or equal to 24), the graph is not planar."
