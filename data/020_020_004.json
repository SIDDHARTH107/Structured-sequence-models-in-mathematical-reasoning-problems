    "message_1": "A company is designing a cylindrical can with a volume of exactly 500 cubic centimeters. The material for the top and bottom of the can costs twice as much as the material for the sides. Determine the dimensions of the can that minimize the cost of materials.",
    "message_2": "Let r be the radius of the base of the cylindrical can, and h be its height. The volume V of the cylinder is given by the formula:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nWe are given that the volume is 500 cubic centimeters, so:\n\n500 = πr^2h\n\nNow, let's find the cost function. The surface area of the top and bottom of the can is given by:\n\nA_top_bottom = 2 * πr^2\n\nSince the material for the top and bottom costs twice as much as the material for the sides, the cost for the top and bottom is:\n\nC_top_bottom = 4 * πr^2\n\nThe surface area of the side of the can is given by:\n\nA_side = 2πrh\n\nSo, the cost for the side is:\n\nC_side = 2πrh\n\nThe total cost C is the sum of the costs for the top and bottom and the side:\n\nC = C_top_bottom + C_side = 4πr^2 + 2πrh\n\nWe want to minimize this cost function. To do this, we will first eliminate one of the variables, either r or h, using the volume equation. From the volume equation, we can express h in terms of r:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the cost function:\n\nC(r) = 4πr^2 + 2πr(500 / (πr^2))\n\nSimplify the cost function:\n\nC(r) = 4πr^2 + 1000/r\n\nNow, to minimize the cost function, we will find its critical points by taking the derivative with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndC/dr = 8πr - 1000/r^2\n\nSet the derivative equal to 0 and solve for r:\n\n8πr - 1000/r^2 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by r^2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n8πr^3 - 1000 = 0\n\nNow, solve for r:\n\nr^3 = 1000 / (8π)\nr^3 = 125 / π\nr = (125 / π)^(1/3)\n\nNow, find the height h using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = 500 / (π((125 / π)^(1/3))^2)\nh = 500 / (125 / π)\nh = 4π\n\nSo, the dimensions of the can that minimize the cost of materials are r ≈ (125 / π)^(1/3) cm and h ≈ 4π cm."
