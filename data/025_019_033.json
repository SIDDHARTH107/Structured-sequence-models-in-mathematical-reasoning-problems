    "message_2": "The degree of a hypersurface in projective space is the degree of its defining polynomial. In this case, the defining polynomial is $x_0^5 + x_1^5 + x_2^5 + x_3^5 = 0$. Since the highest degree of any monomial in this polynomial is 5, the degree of the hypersurface, and thus the degree of the Fano variety, is 5."
