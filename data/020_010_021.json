The machine used to produce the cups can run at a maximum speed of 100 cups per minute, but the actual speed varies from day to day due to various factors such as maintenance, operator skills, etc. The company wants to optimize its production by ensuring that the machine produces at least 85 cups per minute on average while minimizing the variability in the production speed. \n\nAssuming that the actual production speed follows a normal distribution with a mean µ and a standard deviation σ, what is the maximum value of σ that achieves the company's goal of producing at least 85 cups per minute on average while minimizing the variability in the production speed?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of σ such that the probability of producing at least 85 cups per minute is equal to or greater than the desired average production rate. We can use the standard normal distribution table (Z-table) to find the corresponding Z-score for the desired probability.\n\nLet X be the actual production speed, which follows a normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ. We want to find the maximum value of σ such that:\n\nP(X ≥ 85) ≥ 0.85\n\nWe can standardize X by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:\n\nZ = (X - µ) / σ\n\nSince we want the machine to produce at least 85 cups per minute on average, we can set µ = 85. Now we have:\n\nZ = (X - 85) / σ\n\nWe want to find the maximum value of σ such that P(Z ≥ 0) ≥ 0.85. Using the standard normal distribution table, we can find the Z-score corresponding to a probability of 0.85, which is approximately 1.036.\n\nNow we can set up the equation:\n\n1.036 = (85 - 85) / σ\n\nSolving for σ, we get:\n\nσ = 0\n\nHowever, a standard deviation of 0 is not realistic in this context, as it would mean that there is no variability in the production speed. Since the company wants to minimize the variability, we can conclude that the maximum value of σ that achieves the company's goal is as close to 0 as possible while still allowing for some variability in the production speed."
