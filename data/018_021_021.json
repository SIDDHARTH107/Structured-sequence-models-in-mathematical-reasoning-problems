    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of the resulting set with C = {2, 3, 5}.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = {1, 3, 4, 5} ∩ {2, 3, 5} = {3, 5}\n\nNow, we need to show that the formula for the symmetric difference of two sets being distributive over intersection holds true for these sets. The formula is:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C)\n\nLet's find (A ∩ C) and (B ∩ C):\n\nA ∩ C = {1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3, 5} = {2, 3}\nB ∩ C = {2, 4, 5} ∩ {2, 3, 5} = {2, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∩ C) and (B ∩ C):\n\n(A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C) = {2, 3} ∆ {2, 5} = {3, 5}\n\nWe can see that (A ∆ B) ∩ C = {3, 5} and (A ∩ C) ∆ (B ∩ C) = {3, 5}, which means the formula for the symmetric difference of two sets being distributive over intersection holds true for these sets."
