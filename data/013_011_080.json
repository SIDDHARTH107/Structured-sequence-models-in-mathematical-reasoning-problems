    "message_1": "Suppose two burger shops, Burger A and Burger B, are located across the street from each other. If both shops sell identical burgers for $5, what is the probability that a customer will choose to buy from Burger A instead of Burger B if Burger A sets its price at $4.50 and Burger B maintains its price at $5? Assume that customers make their decision based on price alone and that the two shops split the market evenly if they charge the same price.",
    "message_2": "Let's assume that customers will always choose the cheaper option when there is a price difference. Since Burger A is selling its burger for $4.50 and Burger B is selling its burger for $5, all customers will choose Burger A due to the lower price. Therefore, the probability that a customer will choose to buy from Burger A instead of Burger B is 100% or 1."
