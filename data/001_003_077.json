    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we want to make the coefficients of either x or y the same in both equations. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2. This will give us:\n\n4x + 6y = 24 (1st equation multiplied by 2)\n4x + 5y = 23 (2nd equation)\n\nNow, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the x variable:\n\n(4x + 6y) - (4x + 5y) = 24 - 23\n4x + 6y - 4x - 5y = 1\ny = 1\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for x. We'll use the first equation:\n\n2x + 3y = 12\n2x + 3(1) = 12\n2x + 3 = 12\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n2x = 9\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx = 9/2\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 9/2 and y = 1."
