    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the right triangle, we need to find the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) and then add the lengths of all three sides.\n\nLet's denote the base as 'a' (15 cm), the height as 'b' (20 cm), and the hypotenuse as 'c'. Since it's a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n(15 cm)^2 + (20 cm)^2 = c^2\n225 + 400 = c^2\n625 = c^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides:\n\nc = âˆš625\nc = 25 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of the hypotenuse, we can find the perimeter:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c\nPerimeter = 15 cm + 20 cm + 25 cm\nPerimeter = 60 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the right triangle is 60 cm."
