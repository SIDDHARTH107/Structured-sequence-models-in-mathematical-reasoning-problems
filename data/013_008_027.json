    "message_1": "Consider a public goods game with four players where each player can contribute either 0 or 1 to a common pool. The total amount in the common pool is then multiplied by a factor of 2 and evenly distributed among all players. Each player's payoff is the sum of the amount received from the common pool and a fixed amount of 2 minus the amount contributed. \n\nPlayer 1 contributes 1 to the common pool while players 2, 3, and 4 each contribute 0. What will be the total amount in the common pool and each player's payoff in this scenario?",
    "message_2": "In this scenario, the total amount in the common pool is the sum of the contributions from all players. Player 1 contributes 1, while players 2, 3, and 4 contribute 0 each. So the total amount in the common pool is 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.\n\nThe total amount in the common pool is then multiplied by a factor of 2, which gives us 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nThis amount is evenly distributed among all four players, so each player receives 2 / 4 = 0.5.\n\nNow, we can calculate each player's payoff:\n\nPlayer 1:\nPayoff = (Amount received from the common pool) + (Fixed amount) - (Amount contributed)\nPayoff = 0.5 + 2 - 1 = 1.5\n\nPlayers 2, 3, and 4:\nPayoff = (Amount received from the common pool) + (Fixed amount) - (Amount contributed)\nPayoff = 0.5 + 2 - 0 = 2.5\n\nSo, the total amount in the common pool is 2, and the payoffs for each player are as follows: Player 1 has a payoff of 1.5, while players 2, 3, and 4 each have a payoff of 2.5."
