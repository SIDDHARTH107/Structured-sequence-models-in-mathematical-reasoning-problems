    "message_2": "To determine whether the statement is valid or not, we first need to find the Cartesian product A × B, the complements A' and B', and then the Cartesian product of the complements A' × B'. Finally, we will compare (A × B)' with A' × B' to see if they are equal.\n\n1. A × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\n2. To find the complements A' and B', we need to know the universal set U. Let's assume the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4} for both A and B. Then, A' = {3, 4} and B' = {1, 2}.\n\n3. A' × B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\n4. Now, we need to find the complement of A × B, denoted as (A × B)'. Since the universal set for A × B is U × U = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}, we can find (A × B)' by removing the elements of A × B from U × U:\n\n(A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)} - {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)}\n\nComparing the two sets, we see that (A × B)' ≠ A' × B', since (A × B)' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)} and A' × B' = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}. Therefore, the statement is not valid."
