    "message_2": "The Sierpinski tetrahedron, also known as the Sierpinski pyramid, is a fractal created by recursively subdividing a regular tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. After each iteration, the total surface area of the Sierpinski tetrahedron increases.\n\nThe surface area of a regular tetrahedron with edge length s can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface area = √3 * s^2\n\nAfter each iteration, the edge length of the smaller tetrahedra is 1/2 of the previous edge length, and there are 4 times as many tetrahedra. Therefore, the total surface area after each iteration can be calculated as:\n\nTotal surface area = (number of tetrahedra) * (√3 * (edge length)^2)\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the edge length of the smaller tetrahedra is (1/2)^4 = 1/16 times the original edge length, and there are 4^4 = 256 smaller tetrahedra.\n\nSo, the total surface area after 4 iterations is:\n\nTotal surface area = 256 * (√3 * (6/16)^2)\nTotal surface area = 256 * (√3 * (9/16))\nTotal surface area = 256 * (9√3/16)\nTotal surface area = 144√3\n\nThus, the total surface area of the Sierpinski tetrahedron after four iterations with an edge length of 6 units is 144√3 square units."
