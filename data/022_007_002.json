    "message_2": "To find the number of roots of the polynomial equation $z^5 - 8z^3 - 4 = 0$ in the complex plane, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that a polynomial equation of degree n has exactly n roots in the complex plane, counting multiplicities.\n\nIn this case, the polynomial equation is of degree 5, so it has exactly 5 roots in the complex plane."
