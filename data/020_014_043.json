The production process for both products requires a machine that has a maximum capacity of 100 hours per week. Product A requires 2 hours of machine time per unit, and product B requires 3 hours of machine time per unit. The company wants to maximize its profit by determining how many units of product A and product B to produce each week. \n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of product A and product B that the company should produce each week to maximize its profit, assuming that the production process is subject to the maximum capacity constraints?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 15y, subject to the constraint 2x + 3y ≤ 100, where x and y are non-negative integers.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the integer linear programming method. First, we need to find the feasible region for the constraint. The inequality 2x + 3y ≤ 100 represents the maximum machine hours per week. We can rewrite it as y ≤ (100 - 2x) / 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the integer points (x, y) in the feasible region that maximize the profit function P(x, y). We can do this by checking the profit at each integer point in the feasible region and finding the maximum.\n\nChecking the integer points in the feasible region, we find that the maximum profit occurs at (x, y) = (20, 20), where P(20, 20) = 10(20) + 15(20) = 200 + 300 = $500.\n\nSo, the optimal number of units of product A and product B that the company should produce each week to maximize its profit is 20 units of product A and 20 units of product B."
