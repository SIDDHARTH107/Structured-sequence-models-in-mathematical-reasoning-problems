    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products: product A and product B. Each unit of product A requires 1 hour of processing time and generates a profit of $150, while each unit of product B requires 2 hours of processing time and generates a profit of $300. The factory has a maximum of 60 hours available for processing. How many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe total processing time constraint is:\n1x + 2y ≤ 60\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit, which is given by:\nProfit = 150x + 300y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraint and finding the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we need to find the points where the constraint equation is an equality:\n1x + 2y = 60\n\nIf x = 0, then y = 30.\nIf y = 0, then x = 60.\n\nSo, we have two points (0, 30) and (60, 0). Plotting these points and the constraint line, we find that the feasible region is below the line and in the first quadrant (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0).\n\nNow we need to find the corner points of the feasible region, which are (0, 0), (0, 30), and (60, 0).\n\nLet's evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\n1. (0, 0): Profit = 150(0) + 300(0) = $0\n2. (0, 30): Profit = 150(0) + 300(30) = $9,000\n3. (60, 0): Profit = 150(60) + 300(0) = $9,000\n\nBoth points (0, 30) and (60, 0) give the maximum profit of $9,000. This means that the factory can either produce 30 units of product B or 60 units of product A to maximize the profit."
