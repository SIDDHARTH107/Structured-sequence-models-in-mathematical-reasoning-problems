    "message_2": "First, we need to check if there is a solution to the given Diophantine equation. Since the greatest common divisor of 7 and 10 is 1, and 1 divides 221, there exists a solution.\n\nNow, let's find a particular solution. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which states that there exist integers x and y such that:\n\n7x + 10y = gcd(7, 10)\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n10 = 1 * 7 + 3\n7 = 2 * 3 + 1\n\nNow, working backwards:\n\n1 = 7 - 2 * 3\n1 = 7 - 2 * (10 - 1 * 7)\n1 = 3 * 7 - 2 * 10\n\nSo, we have found a particular solution: x = 3, y = -2. However, we need positive integer solutions. To find all integer solutions, we can use the general solution of a linear Diophantine equation:\n\nx = x0 + k * (b / gcd(a, b))\ny = y0 - k * (a / gcd(a, b))\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is a particular solution, and k is an integer.\n\nIn our case, x0 = 3, y0 = -2, a = 7, b = 10, and gcd(a, b) = 1. So the general solution is:\n\nx = 3 + 10k\ny = -2 - 7k\n\nNow, we need to find the values of k for which both x and y are positive integers. Let's first find the range of k for which x is positive:\n\n3 + 10k > 0\nk > -3/10\n\nSince k is an integer, the smallest value of k that satisfies this inequality is k = 0. Now, let's find the range of k for which y is positive:\n\n-2 - 7k < 0\nk < 2/7\n\nSince k is an integer, the largest value of k that satisfies this inequality is k = -1. However, this would give us the same particular solution we started with (x = 3, y = -2), which has a negative y value.\n\nThus, there are no positive integer solutions for the given Diophantine equation."
