    "message_1": "A triangle has one angle of 35° and another angle of 55°. The length of the side opposite the 35° angle is 7 inches, and the length of the side opposite the 55° angle is 9 inches. What is the length of the side opposite the remaining angle? Use the law of sines to solve.",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the angles as A, B, and C, and their opposite sides as a, b, and c, respectively. We are given:\n\nA = 35°, a = 7 inches\nB = 55°, b = 9 inches\n\nWe can find angle C by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°:\n\nC = 180° - A - B = 180° - 35° - 55° = 90°\n\nNow we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side c:\n\na / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)\n\nWe can use the given values for a, A, and B to find the length of side c:\n\n7 / sin(35°) = 9 / sin(55°) = c / sin(90°)\n\nSince sin(90°) = 1, we can simplify the equation to:\n\nc = 7 / sin(35°) = 9 / sin(55°)\n\nNow we can solve for c:\n\nc = 7 * sin(55°) / sin(35°)\n\nUsing a calculator to find the sine values:\n\nc ≈ 7 * 0.8192 / 0.5736\nc ≈ 10.006\n\nThe length of the side opposite the remaining angle (C) is approximately 10 inches."
