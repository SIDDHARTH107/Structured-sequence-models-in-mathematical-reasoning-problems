    "message_1": "In a game of chance, a player has a 1 in 5 chance of winning a prize. If the player buys 7 tickets, what is the probability of winning at least one prize?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of winning at least one prize, we can first find the probability of not winning any prizes and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of not winning a prize on a single ticket is 4/5 (since there's a 1/5 chance of winning, there must be a 4/5 chance of not winning).\n\nThe probability of not winning any prizes on all 7 tickets is (4/5)^7, which is approximately 0.279.\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of winning at least one prize:\n\n1 - 0.279 = 0.721\n\nSo, the probability of winning at least one prize when buying 7 tickets is approximately 0.721 or 72.1%."
