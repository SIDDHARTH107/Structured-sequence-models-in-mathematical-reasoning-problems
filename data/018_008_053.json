    "message_1": "Consider two sets A and B, such that A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5}. Find the Cartesian product of A and B, i.e., A x B, and then find the Cartesian product of B and A, i.e., B x A. Show that these two products are not equal, thus proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative.",
    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product of A and B (A x B), we form ordered pairs with the first element from set A and the second element from set B. \n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of B and A (B x A). This time, we form ordered pairs with the first element from set B and the second element from set A.\n\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two Cartesian products:\n\nA x B = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}\nB x A = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nWe can see that the ordered pairs in A x B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B x A. Therefore, A x B â‰  B x A, proving that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative."
