    "message_2": "To find the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation b^x ≡ 7 (mod 29) for any base b, we can use the concept of the order of an element in modular arithmetic.\n\nThe order of an element b (mod 29) is the smallest positive integer x such that b^x ≡ 1 (mod 29). According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if b is coprime to 29 (i.e., gcd(b, 29) = 1), then b^(29-1) ≡ 1 (mod 29). So, the order of b (mod 29) divides 29-1 = 28.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible divisors of 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. We want to find the smallest x such that b^x ≡ 7 (mod 29) for any base b.\n\nLet's check each divisor:\n\n1. If x = 1, then b^x = b, which means b ≡ 7 (mod 29). This is true only for b = 7, so x = 1 is not a solution for any base b.\n\n2. If x = 2, then b^x = b^2. We can check all possible values of b (1 to 28) and see if any of them satisfy the equation b^2 ≡ 7 (mod 29). After checking, we find that b = 6 and b = 23 satisfy the equation. So, x = 2 is the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation b^x ≡ 7 (mod 29) for any base b.\n\nTherefore, the smallest value of x is 2."
