    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = 2x^5 with respect to x, we will use the power rule. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to f(x) = 2x^5, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 5 * 2x^(5-1) = 10x^4"
