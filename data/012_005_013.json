    "message_2": "The diameter of a graph is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. In other words, it is the greatest distance between any pair of vertices.\n\nTo find the diameter of the given graph, we need to find the shortest path between every pair of vertices and then determine the longest of these shortest paths.\n\nHere are the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices:\n\n1-2: 1\n1-3: 1\n1-4: 2\n1-5: 2\n1-6: 3\n2-3: 2\n2-4: 1\n2-5: 1\n2-6: 2\n3-4: 2\n3-5: 2\n3-6: 1\n4-5: 2\n4-6: 3\n5-6: 2\n\nThe longest of these shortest paths is 3, which occurs between vertices 1-6 and 4-6.\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the given graph is 3."
