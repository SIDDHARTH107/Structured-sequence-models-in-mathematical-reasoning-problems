    "message_2": "The Biot-Savart Law states that the magnetic field dB at a point P due to a small current element Idl is given by:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dl × r) / r³\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A), I is the current, dl is the small current element, r is the position vector from the current element to the point P, and × denotes the cross product.\n\nFor a straight wire of length L carrying a current I, we can integrate the Biot-Savart Law along the length of the wire to find the magnetic field at a point P at a perpendicular distance R from the wire.\n\nLet's consider a small current element dl at a distance x from one end of the wire. The position vector r from dl to point P is given by:\n\nr = R * j + x * i\n\nwhere i and j are unit vectors along the x and y axes, respectively. The magnitude of r is:\n\n|r| = √(R² + x²)\n\nThe direction of dl is along the wire, so dl = dx * i. The cross product dl × r is:\n\ndl × r = (dx * i) × (R * j + x * i) = dx * i × R * j = dx * R * k\n\nwhere k is the unit vector along the z-axis.\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the Biot-Savart Law:\n\ndB = (μ₀ / 4π) * (I * dx * R * k) / (R² + x²)^(3/2)\n\nThe magnetic field B at point P is the integral of dB along the length of the wire:\n\nB = ∫(dB) = (μ₀ * I * R / 4π) * ∫(dx / (R² + x²)^(3/2))\n\nThe limits of integration are from x = 0 to x = L (10 meters in this case). To solve this integral, we can use the substitution:\n\nx = R * tan(θ) => dx = R * sec²(θ) * dθ\n\nThe integral becomes:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R / 4π) * ∫(R * sec²(θ) * dθ / (R² * (1 + tan²(θ)))^(3/2))\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity 1 + tan²(θ) = sec²(θ), we get:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R / 4π) * ∫(dθ / (1 + tan²(θ)))\n\nThe limits of integration for θ can be found by substituting the limits of x:\n\nx = 0 => θ = 0\nx = L => θ = arctan(L/R)\n\nNow we can integrate:\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R / 4π) * [arctan(tan(θ))] from 0 to arctan(L/R)\n\nB = (μ₀ * I * R / 4π) * [arctan(L/R)]\n\nNow we can plug in the given values: L = 10 meters, I = 5 A, R = 2 meters, and μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A * 5 A * 2 m / 4π) * arctan(10 m / 2 m)\n\nB = (10^(-6) T * 10) * arctan(5)\n\nB ≈ 10^(-5) T * 1.3734\n\nB ≈ 1.3734 × 10^(-5) T\n\nThe magnetic field at a distance of 2 meters from the wire is approximately 1.3734 × 10^(-5) Tesla."
