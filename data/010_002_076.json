    "message_2": "In this case, the concept of continuity is not applicable, as continuity is a property of functions defined on metric spaces or topological spaces, which usually involve real numbers or more general spaces. The sets X and Y here are finite sets of integers, and the function f is simply a mapping between these sets. \n\nHowever, we can discuss whether the function f is injective (one-to-one) or surjective (onto).\n\nf is not injective, because f(1) = f(3) = 4, so there are distinct elements in X that have the same image in Y.\n\nf is not surjective, because there is no element x in X such that f(x) = 6. The element 6 in Y is not the image of any element in X under the function f.\n\nIn summary, the function f is neither continuous (as continuity is not applicable here), nor injective, nor surjective."
