    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π], we will first find the Fourier coefficients a_n, b_n, and a_0. The Fourier series is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity, and the coefficients are given by:\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] f(x) * sin(nx) dx\n\nSince f(x) = x^2 is an even function, all the b_n coefficients will be zero. Now, let's find a_0 and a_n:\n\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 dx\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * [(x^3)/3] | from -π to π\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * [(π^3)/3 - (-π^3)/3]\na_0 = (1/(2π)) * (2π^3)/3\na_0 = π^2/3\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x^2 * cos(nx) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = x^2, dv = cos(nx) dx\ndu = 2x dx, v = (1/n) * sin(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(uv) | from -π to π - ∫[-π, π] v du]\n\nThe first term (uv) will be zero because sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n. So, we have:\n\na_n = (1/π) * (- ∫[-π, π] (1/n) * sin(nx) * 2x dx)\n\nNow, let's integrate by parts again:\n\nu = 2x, dv = sin(nx) dx\ndu = 2 dx, v = (-1/(n^2)) * cos(nx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula:\n\na_n = (1/π) * (- ∫[-π, π] (-1/(n^2)) * cos(nx) * 2 dx)\n\na_n = (2/(n^2π)) * ∫[-π, π] cos(nx) dx\n\nThe integral of cos(nx) over [-π, π] is zero, so:\n\na_n = 0\n\nThus, the Fourier series of f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = π^2/3\n\nThis result may seem surprising, but it's due to the fact that the Fourier series converges to the function f(x) = x^2 only at points where f(x) is continuous. At the endpoints of the interval, the Fourier series converges to the average value of the function, which in this case is π^2/3."
