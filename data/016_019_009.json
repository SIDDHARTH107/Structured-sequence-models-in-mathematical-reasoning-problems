    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After the second iteration, each side of the initial triangle will be replaced by a Koch curve of 4^(2) = 16 segments, each with a length of (1/3)^(2) = 1/9 times the original side length.\n\nSo, the length of each side after the second iteration will be 16 * (1/9) * 4 = 64/9 cm.\n\nSince the Koch island is an equilateral triangle, it has three sides. Therefore, the overall length of the Koch island after the second iteration will be 3 * (64/9) = 192/9 cm."
