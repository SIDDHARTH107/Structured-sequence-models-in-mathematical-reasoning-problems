    "message_1": "A company's stock price follows the function $f(x) = 50\\sin(2\\pi x/365) + 100$, where $x$ represents the number of days since January 1st and $f(x)$ represents the stock price in dollars. Use the Fourier transform to find the frequency and amplitude of the dominant periodic component in the stock price data.",
    "message_2": "The given function is already in a sinusoidal form, so we don't need to apply the Fourier transform to find the frequency and amplitude of the dominant periodic component. The function is:\n\n$f(x) = 50\\sin(2\\pi x/365) + 100$\n\nHere, the amplitude of the sinusoidal component is 50, which is the coefficient of the sine function. The frequency can be found by looking at the argument of the sine function:\n\n$2\\pi x/365$\n\nThe coefficient of $x$ in the argument is the angular frequency, which is $2\\pi/365$. To find the frequency in cycles per day, we can divide the angular frequency by $2\\pi$:\n\nFrequency = $(2\\pi/365) / (2\\pi) = 1/365$ cycles per day\n\nSo, the dominant periodic component has an amplitude of 50 and a frequency of 1/365 cycles per day."
