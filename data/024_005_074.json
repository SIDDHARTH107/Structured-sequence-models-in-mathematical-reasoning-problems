    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures and their corresponding principal directions at the point (1, 1, 4), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface S(u, v).\n\n1. Compute the tangent vectors:\nLet S(u, v) = (x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)). Then the tangent vectors are given by the partial derivatives of S with respect to u and v:\n\nSu = dS/du = (2u, 4u, 4v)\nSv = dS/dv = (2v, -6v, 4u)\n\n2. Compute the first fundamental form:\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nI = [E F; F G], where E = <Su, Su>, F = <Su, Sv>, and G = <Sv, Sv>.\n\nE = <(2u, 4u, 4v), (2u, 4u, 4v)> = 4u^2 + 16u^2 + 16v^2 = 20u^2 + 16v^2\nF = <(2u, 4u, 4v), (2v, -6v, 4u)> = 4uv - 24uv + 16uv = -4uv\nG = <(2v, -6v, 4u), (2v, -6v, 4u)> = 4v^2 + 36v^2 + 16u^2 = 40v^2 + 16u^2\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 4), we have E = 36, F = -4, and G = 56.\n\n3. Compute the second fundamental form:\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nII = [L M; M N], where L = <Suu, N>, M = <Suv, N>, and N = <Svv, N>.\n\nFirst, compute the normal vector N:\nN = Su x Sv = (2u, 4u, 4v) x (2v, -6v, 4u) = (16uv + 24uv, 8u^2 - 8v^2, -12u^2 - 4u^2) = (40uv, 8(u^2 - v^2), -16u^2)\n\nNow, compute the second derivatives:\nSuu = d^2S/du^2 = (2, 4, 0)\nSuv = d^2S/dudv = (0, 0, 4)\nSvv = d^2S/dv^2 = (2, -6, 0)\n\nNext, compute L, M, and N:\nL = <(2, 4, 0), (40uv, 8(u^2 - v^2), -16u^2)> = 80u^2 + 32u^2 = 112u^2\nM = <(0, 0, 4), (40uv, 8(u^2 - v^2), -16u^2)> = -64u^2\nN = <(2, -6, 0), (40uv, 8(u^2 - v^2), -16u^2)> = 80v^2 - 48v^2 = 32v^2\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 4), we have L = 112, M = -64, and N = 32.\n\n4. Compute the principal curvatures:\nThe principal curvatures k1 and k2 are the eigenvalues of the matrix (I^(-1)) * II. First, compute the inverse of the first fundamental form I:\n\ndet(I) = EG - F^2 = (36)(56) - (-4)^2 = 2016 - 16 = 2000\nI^(-1) = (1/det(I)) * [G -F; -F E] = (1/2000) * [56 -4; -4 36]\n\nNow, compute the product (I^(-1)) * II:\n(I^(-1)) * II = (1/2000) * [56 -4; -4 36] * [112 -64; -64 32] = [0.056 -0.032; -0.032 0.016]\n\nThe principal curvatures k1 and k2 are the eigenvalues of this matrix. The characteristic equation is given by:\ndet([0.056 - k, -0.032; -0.032, 0.016 - k]) = (0.056 - k)(0.016 - k) - (-0.032)^2 = 0\n\nSolving for k, we get k1 = 0.072 and k2 = 0.\n\n5. Compute the principal directions:\nThe principal directions are the eigenvectors of the matrix (I^(-1)) * II corresponding to the eigenvalues k1 and k2. For k1 = 0.072, we have:\n\n[0.056 - 0.072, -0.032; -0.032, 0.016 - 0.072] * [a; b] = [0; 0]\n[-0.016, -0.032; -0.032, -0.056] * [a; b] = [0; 0]\n\nFrom the first row, we get -0.016a - 0.032b = 0, which implies a = -2b. The principal direction corresponding to k1 is any nonzero scalar multiple of the vector (-2, 1).\n\nFor k2 = 0, we have:\n\n[0.056, -0.032; -0.032, 0.016] * [a; b] = [0; 0]\n\nFrom the first row, we get 0.056a - 0.032b = 0, which implies a = 4/7b. The principal direction corresponding to k2 is any nonzero scalar multiple of the vector (4, 7).\n\nIn conclusion, the principal curvatures at the point (1, 1, 4) are k1 = 0.072 and k2 = 0, and their corresponding principal directions are (-2, 1) and (4, 7), respectively."
