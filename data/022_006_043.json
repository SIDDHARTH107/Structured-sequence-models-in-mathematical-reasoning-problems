    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ for $z$ on the closed disk $|z| \\leq 2$, we will use the maximum modulus principle. The maximum modulus principle states that if a function is holomorphic (analytic) in a bounded domain and continuous up to its boundary, then the maximum value of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nThe function $f(z) = ze^z$ is holomorphic in the entire complex plane, so it is holomorphic in the closed disk $|z| \\leq 2$. Now, we need to find the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary of the disk, which is the circle $|z| = 2$.\n\nLet $z = re^{i\\theta}$, where $r = 2$ and $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$. Then, $f(z) = 2e^{i\\theta}e^{2e^{i\\theta}}$. We have:\n\n$$|f(z)| = |2e^{i\\theta}e^{2e^{i\\theta}}| = 2|e^{i\\theta}||e^{2e^{i\\theta}}| = 2|e^{2e^{i\\theta}}|$$\n\nSince $|e^w| = e^{\\operatorname{Re}(w)}$ for any complex number $w$, we need to find the maximum value of $\\operatorname{Re}(2e^{i\\theta})$ for $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$.\n\nLet $w = 2e^{i\\theta}$. Then, $w = 2(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)$, and $\\operatorname{Re}(w) = 2\\cos\\theta$. The maximum value of $\\operatorname{Re}(w)$ is $2$, which occurs when $\\theta = 0$ or $\\theta = 2\\pi$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary of the disk is $2|e^2| = 2e^2$. By the maximum modulus principle, the maximum value of $|f(z)|$ in the closed disk $|z| \\leq 2$ is also $2e^2$."
