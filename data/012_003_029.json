    "message_1": "Consider a graph with 7 vertices and the following edges:\n(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (6,7)\nWhat is the maximum number of independent vertices in this graph, and which vertices are part of this maximum independent set?",
    "message_2": "An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. To find the maximum independent set, we can look for vertices that are not connected by any edges.\n\nIn this graph, we can see that the maximum independent set consists of 4 vertices. One possible maximum independent set is {1, 4, 5, 6}. Another possible maximum independent set is {1, 4, 5, 7}. In both cases, none of the vertices in the set are connected by any edges, and we cannot add any more vertices without violating the independence condition."
