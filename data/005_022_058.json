    "message_2": "First, we need to sort the data set in ascending order:\n$$5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12$$\n\nNow, we can find the five-number summary:\n1. Minimum: The smallest value in the data set is 5.\n2. First quartile (Q1): The median of the lower half of the data set is the average of 5 and 6, which is 5.5.\n3. Median (Q2): Since there are 8 values, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th values, which is the average of 7 and 8, which is 7.5.\n4. Third quartile (Q3): The median of the upper half of the data set is the average of 9 and 11, which is 10.\n5. Maximum: The largest value in the data set is 12.\n\nNow we can calculate the interquartile range (IQR):\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 10 - 5.5 = 4.5\n\nNext, we can find the lower and upper bounds for outliers:\nLower bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR = 5.5 - 1.5 * 4.5 = 5.5 - 6.75 = -1.25\nUpper bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR = 10 + 1.5 * 4.5 = 10 + 6.75 = 16.75\n\nSince there are no values in the data set that are less than the lower bound or greater than the upper bound, there are no outliers.\n\nIn summary, the median is 7.5, and the interquartile range is 4.5."
