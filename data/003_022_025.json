    "message_2": "To find the dot product of the vectors representing the sides XY and XZ, we first need to find the coordinates of the vertices X, Y, and Z. Let's assume that vertex X is at the origin (0, 0). Since the side XY has a length of 5 units, we can place vertex Y at (5, 0). Now, we need to find the coordinates of vertex Z.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the triangle with respect to side XY. Let h be the height of the triangle. Then, we have:\n\nh^2 + (5/2)^2 = 8^2\nh^2 + 6.25 = 64\nh^2 = 57.75\nh ≈ 7.6\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of vertex Z. Since the height is approximately 7.6 and the base is 5, we can place vertex Z at (2.5, 7.6).\n\nNow, we can find the vectors representing the sides XY and XZ. The vector XY is given by:\n\nXY = Y - X = (5, 0) - (0, 0) = (5, 0)\n\nThe vector XZ is given by:\n\nXZ = Z - X = (2.5, 7.6) - (0, 0) = (2.5, 7.6)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product of these two vectors:\n\nXY · XZ = (5, 0) · (2.5, 7.6) = (5 * 2.5) + (0 * 7.6) = 12.5\n\nSo, the dot product of the vectors representing the sides XY and XZ is 12.5."
