    "message_2": "The probability of a ransomware attack occurring on a particular network can be calculated using the historical data provided. \n\nThere have been 3 successful ransomware attacks out of 20 cyber attacks on the network. To find the probability, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of successful ransomware attacks) / (Total number of cyber attacks)\n\nProbability = 3 / 20\n\nProbability = 0.15\n\nSo, the probability of a ransomware attack occurring on the particular network is 0.15 or 15%."
