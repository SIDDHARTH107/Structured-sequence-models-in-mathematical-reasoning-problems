    "message_1": "A signal processing engineer wants to analyze a periodic signal using Fourier transforms. The signal has a frequency of 100 Hz and a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Write a mathematical equation to find the number of samples required to accurately represent the signal using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To accurately represent a periodic signal using Fourier transforms, we need to consider the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. According to this theorem, the sampling rate should be at least twice the highest frequency component in the signal to avoid aliasing. In this case, the highest frequency component is 100 Hz, so the minimum required sampling rate is 200 Hz. Since the given sampling rate is 1000 Hz, which is higher than the minimum required, we can proceed with the analysis.\n\nNow, to find the number of samples required to accurately represent one period of the signal, we can use the following equation:\n\nNumber of samples = Sampling rate / Signal frequency\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nNumber of samples = 1000 Hz / 100 Hz = 10\n\nSo, 10 samples are required to accurately represent the signal using the Fourier transform."
