    "message_1": "Consider the partial differential equation:\n\nu_t = 2u_{xx} + 3u_{yy}\n\nwhere u(x,y,t) is a function that represents the temperature at location (x,y) and time t. Suppose that the initial temperature distribution is given by:\n\nu(x,y,0) = sin(2x)cos(3y)\n\nFind the temperature distribution u(x,y,t) for t > 0 and verify that it remains bounded as t approaches infinity.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written in the form:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstitute this into the PDE:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = 2X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + 3X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2XYT:\n\n\\frac{T'(t)}{2T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{3Y''(y)}{2Y(y)}\n\nSince the left side is a function of t only and the right side is a function of x and y only, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ:\n\n\\frac{T'(t)}{2T(t)} = -λ\n\nT'(t) = -2λT(t)\n\nNow, we have an ordinary differential equation for T(t). The general solution is:\n\nT(t) = Ce^{-2λt}\n\nNow, let's solve the spatial part of the equation:\n\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{3Y''(y)}{2Y(y)} = -λ\n\nLet's separate the variables:\n\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -λ - \\frac{3Y''(y)}{2Y(y)}\n\nLet's call the constant on the right side μ:\n\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = μ\n\nX''(x) - μX(x) = 0\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{μ}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{μ}x)\n\nNow, let's solve for Y(y):\n\n\\frac{3Y''(y)}{2Y(y)} = -λ - μ\n\nY''(y) - \\frac{2}{3}(-λ - μ)Y(y) = 0\n\nLet's call the constant on the right side ν:\n\nY''(y) - \\frac{2}{3}νY(y) = 0\n\nThe general solution for Y(y) is:\n\nY(y) = D\\cos(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}ν}y) + E\\sin(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}ν}y)\n\nNow, we have the general solution for u(x, y, t):\n\nu(x, y, t) = (A\\cos(\\sqrt{μ}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{μ}x))(D\\cos(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}ν}y) + E\\sin(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}ν}y))Ce^{-2λt}\n\nTo find the specific solution that satisfies the initial condition u(x, y, 0) = sin(2x)cos(3y), we need to find the values of A, B, D, and E. Since the initial condition is given, we have:\n\nsin(2x)cos(3y) = (A\\cos(\\sqrt{μ}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{μ}x))(D\\cos(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}ν}y) + E\\sin(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}ν}y))\n\nComparing the coefficients, we have:\n\nA = 0, B = 1, D = 1, E = 0, √μ = 2, √(2/3)ν = 3\n\nThus, μ = 4 and ν = 9/2. The specific solution is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = \\sin(2x)\\cos(3y)Ce^{-2λt}\n\nTo ensure that the temperature remains bounded as t approaches infinity, we need to show that the exponential term goes to zero. Since λ is positive, the exponential term will indeed go to zero as t approaches infinity:\n\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} e^{-2λt} = 0\n\nThus, the temperature distribution u(x, y, t) remains bounded as t approaches infinity."
