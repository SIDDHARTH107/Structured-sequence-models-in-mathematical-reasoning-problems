    "message_1": "A company manufacturing t-shirts aims to maximize their profit. The cost of producing each t-shirt is $6 and they sell each t-shirt for $15. The company also incurs a fixed cost of $5000 for rent, salaries, and other overhead expenses. Using whale optimization algorithm, what is the maximum number of t-shirts they need to produce and sell to achieve the highest profit?",
    "message_2": "The whale optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the social behavior of humpback whales. However, the problem presented here can be solved using a simpler approach.\n\nLet's denote the number of t-shirts produced and sold as x. The cost of producing x t-shirts is 6x, and the revenue from selling x t-shirts is 15x. The fixed cost is $5000. The profit function can be represented as:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Total Cost\nProfit = (15x) - (6x + 5000)\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the profit function. In this case, since the profit function is linear, the more t-shirts the company produces and sells, the higher the profit will be. There is no maximum point in this linear function.\n\nHowever, we can find the minimum number of t-shirts they need to produce and sell to break even (i.e., when the profit is 0):\n\n0 = (15x) - (6x + 5000)\n5000 = 9x\nx = 5000 / 9\nx â‰ˆ 555.56\n\nSince the company cannot produce a fraction of a t-shirt, they need to produce and sell at least 556 t-shirts to break even. After this point, the more t-shirts they produce and sell, the higher their profit will be. There is no maximum number of t-shirts to achieve the highest profit, as the profit will continue to increase as long as they can produce and sell more t-shirts."
