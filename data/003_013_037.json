    "message_1": "A farmer wants to construct a rectangular enclosure for his cows using a straight river bank as one of the shorter sides of the enclosure. If he has 400 meters of fencing wire, what is the maximum area he can enclose for his cows?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the length of the enclosure parallel to the river bank as x meters, and the length perpendicular to the river bank as y meters. Since the river bank serves as one of the shorter sides, we only need to use the fencing wire for the other three sides. Therefore, the total length of the fencing wire can be represented as:\n\nx + 2y = 400\n\nWe want to find the maximum area of the enclosure, which can be represented as:\n\nArea = x * y\n\nFirst, we need to express y in terms of x using the equation x + 2y = 400:\n\n2y = 400 - x\ny = (400 - x) / 2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the area equation:\n\nArea = x * ((400 - x) / 2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nArea = (400x - x^2) / 2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can use the vertex form of a quadratic equation, which is given by:\n\nx_vertex = -b / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = -1/2 and b = 400. Therefore:\n\nx_vertex = -400 / (2 * -1/2) = 400 / 1 = 400\n\nNow, substitute the value of x_vertex back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (400 - 400) / 2 = 0\n\nHowever, this result does not make sense in the context of the problem, as it would mean that there is no enclosure. This is because the vertex represents the maximum value of the quadratic function, but in this case, we are looking for the maximum area of the enclosure. To find the maximum area, we need to find the critical points of the function by taking the first derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nd(Area) / dx = (400 - 2x) / 2\n\nSet the derivative to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = (400 - 2x) / 2\n0 = 400 - 2x\n2x = 400\nx = 200\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = (400 - 200) / 2 = 200 / 2 = 100\n\nSo, the dimensions of the enclosure that give the maximum area are x = 200 meters and y = 100 meters. The maximum area can be calculated as:\n\nArea = x * y = 200 * 100 = 20,000 square meters\n\nTherefore, the maximum area the farmer can enclose for his cows is 20,000 square meters."
