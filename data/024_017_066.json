    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector along the curve, we need to find the tangent vector of the curve and then transport the initial vector along the curve while keeping it parallel to the tangent vector.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector of the curve by taking the derivative of r(t) with respect to t:\n\nr'(t) = (-sin(t), cos(t), 2)\n\nNow, we need to transport the initial vector (0,1,0) along the curve while keeping it parallel to the tangent vector. To do this, we can use the following equation for parallel transport:\n\nV(t) = V(0) - (V(0) · r'(t)) * r'(t)\n\nwhere V(t) is the transported vector at time t, V(0) is the initial vector, and r'(t) is the tangent vector of the curve.\n\nLet's plug in the values for t = 3:\n\nr'(3) = (-sin(3), cos(3), 2)\nV(3) = (0,1,0) - ((0,1,0) · (-sin(3), cos(3), 2)) * (-sin(3), cos(3), 2)\n\nCalculating the dot product:\n\n(0,1,0) · (-sin(3), cos(3), 2) = 0*(-sin(3)) + 1*cos(3) + 0*2 = cos(3)\n\nNow, multiply the dot product by the tangent vector:\n\ncos(3) * (-sin(3), cos(3), 2) = (-cos(3)*sin(3), cos^2(3), 2*cos(3))\n\nFinally, subtract this from the initial vector:\n\nV(3) = (0,1,0) - (-cos(3)*sin(3), cos^2(3), 2*cos(3))\nV(3) = (cos(3)*sin(3), 1 - cos^2(3), -2*cos(3))\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector along the curve from t = 0 to t = 3 is:\n\nV(3) = (cos(3)*sin(3), 1 - cos^2(3), -2*cos(3))"
