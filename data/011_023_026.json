    "message_2": "The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph with 7 vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color depends on the structure of the graph. In the worst-case scenario, the graph is a complete graph, meaning that every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nIn this case, we can use the greedy coloring algorithm to find the minimum number of colors needed. We start by coloring the first vertex with the first color. Then, for each subsequent vertex, we assign the smallest color that is not already used by any of its adjacent vertices.\n\nFor a complete graph with 7 vertices, the minimum number of colors needed is 7. This is because each vertex is connected to every other vertex, so no two adjacent vertices can share the same color.\n\nHowever, if the graph is not complete, the minimum number of colors needed may be less than 7. For example, if the graph is a cycle with 7 vertices, we only need 3 colors to properly color the graph."
