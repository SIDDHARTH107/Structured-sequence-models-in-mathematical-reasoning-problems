    "message_1": "A beam is subjected to a uniform load of 20 kN/m and its length is 4 meters. The beam has a rectangular cross section with a base width of 50 mm and height varying from 100 mm at the supports to 50 mm at the midpoint. The maximum stress in the beam should not exceed 120 MPa. Determine the optimum height variation of the beam that minimizes its weight.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimum height variation of the beam that minimizes its weight, we need to find the height function that satisfies the maximum stress condition and minimizes the volume (and thus the weight) of the beam.\n\nLet's denote the height of the beam at a distance x from the left support as h(x). Since the height varies linearly from 100 mm at the supports to 50 mm at the midpoint, we can write the height function as:\n\nh(x) = 100 - 50 * |2x/L - 1|\n\nwhere L is the length of the beam (4 meters).\n\nNow, let's calculate the moment of inertia (I) for the rectangular cross-section:\n\nI(x) = (b * h(x)^3) / 12\n\nwhere b is the base width (50 mm).\n\nThe maximum bending moment (M) for a simply supported beam with a uniform load (w) occurs at the midpoint:\n\nM = (w * L^2) / 8\n\nwhere w is the uniform load (20 kN/m) and L is the length of the beam (4 meters).\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum stress (σ) in the beam using the bending stress formula:\n\nσ = (M * ymax) / I(x)\n\nwhere ymax is the maximum distance from the neutral axis, which is half of the height (h(x)/2).\n\nWe need to satisfy the maximum stress condition:\n\nσ ≤ 120 MPa\n\nSubstituting the expressions for M, ymax, and I(x) into the stress formula, we get:\n\n(20 * 10^3 * 4^2) / (8 * (100 - 50 * |2x/4 - 1|)) ≤ 120 * 10^6\n\nSolving for x, we find that the height function that satisfies the maximum stress condition is:\n\nh(x) = 100 - 50 * |2x/4 - 1|\n\nNow, we need to minimize the volume (and thus the weight) of the beam. The volume of the beam can be calculated as:\n\nV = ∫[b * h(x)] dx from 0 to L\n\nV = 50 * ∫[100 - 50 * |2x/4 - 1|] dx from 0 to 4\n\nCalculating the integral, we get:\n\nV = 50 * (200x - 25x^2) from 0 to 4\n\nV = 50 * (800 - 400) = 20,000 mm^3\n\nThus, the optimum height variation of the beam that minimizes its weight while satisfying the maximum stress condition is:\n\nh(x) = 100 - 50 * |2x/4 - 1|"
