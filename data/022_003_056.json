    "message_2": "To evaluate the integral of the complex function f(z) = 1/z along the contour C, we will use the parameterization of the circle and then apply Cauchy's integral theorem.\n\nLet the contour C be given by the parameterization z(t) = 2e^(it), where t ranges from 0 to 2π. Then, the derivative of z(t) with respect to t is:\n\ndz/dt = 2ie^(it)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n∫(C) f(z) dz = ∫(0 to 2π) f(z(t)) * (dz/dt) dt\n\nSubstitute f(z) = 1/z and the expressions for z(t) and dz/dt:\n\n∫(C) (1/z) dz = ∫(0 to 2π) (1/(2e^(it))) * (2ie^(it)) dt\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n∫(C) (1/z) dz = ∫(0 to 2π) i dt\n\nNow, integrate with respect to t:\n\n∫(C) (1/z) dz = [it] (from 0 to 2π)\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\n[it] (from 0 to 2π) = i(2π) - i(0) = 2πi\n\nSo, the integral of the complex function f(z) = 1/z along the contour C is 2πi."
