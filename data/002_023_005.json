    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven a sphere with a radius of 5 units, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5^2)\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25\n\nSurface Area = 100π\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π to 3.14159 and multiply it by 100:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 100 * 3.14159\n\nSurface Area ≈ 314.159\n\nRounding the answer to two decimal places, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 314.16 square units."
