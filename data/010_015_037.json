    "message_2": "To show that there exists a nontrivial closed 1-form $\\alpha$ on $M$ such that $\\omega \\wedge \\alpha$ is a nontrivial element of $H^3(M,\\mathbb{R})$, we will use the Poincaré lemma and the fact that $H^2(M,\\mathbb{R})$ is nontrivial.\n\nSince $H^2(M,\\mathbb{R})$ is nontrivial, there exists a closed 2-form $\\omega$ on $M$ that is not exact, i.e., $\\omega$ is not the exterior derivative of any 1-form on $M$. Now, let's consider the exterior product $\\omega \\wedge \\alpha$ for a closed 1-form $\\alpha$ on $M$. We want to show that this 3-form is nontrivial in $H^3(M,\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nFirst, note that $\\omega \\wedge \\alpha$ is closed since the exterior derivative of a wedge product is given by $d(\\omega \\wedge \\alpha) = d\\omega \\wedge \\alpha + (-1)^2 \\omega \\wedge d\\alpha = 0$, where we used the fact that $\\omega$ and $\\alpha$ are closed.\n\nNow, suppose for contradiction that $\\omega \\wedge \\alpha$ is exact, i.e., there exists a 2-form $\\beta$ on $M$ such that $d\\beta = \\omega \\wedge \\alpha$. Then, we have $d(\\beta \\wedge \\alpha) = d\\beta \\wedge \\alpha + (-1)^2 \\beta \\wedge d\\alpha = \\omega \\wedge \\alpha \\wedge \\alpha = 0$, since the wedge product of a form with itself is zero. By the Poincaré lemma, there exists a 1-form $\\gamma$ on $M$ such that $d\\gamma = \\beta \\wedge \\alpha$. \n\nNow, we can write $\\omega = d\\beta - \\beta \\wedge \\alpha = d(\\beta - \\gamma)$. This contradicts the fact that $\\omega$ is not exact. Therefore, our assumption that $\\omega \\wedge \\alpha$ is exact must be false, and $\\omega \\wedge \\alpha$ is a nontrivial element of $H^3(M,\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nIn conclusion, there exists a nontrivial closed 1-form $\\alpha$ on $M$ such that $\\omega \\wedge \\alpha$ is a nontrivial element of $H^3(M,\\mathbb{R})$."
