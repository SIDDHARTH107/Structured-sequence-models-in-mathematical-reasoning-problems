    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(2x+1) - √(x-3) = 2, we will first isolate one of the square roots. Let's isolate the √(2x+1) term:\n\n√(2x+1) = √(x-3) + 2\n\nNow, we will square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(√(2x+1))^2 = (√(x-3) + 2)^2\n\n2x + 1 = (x - 3 + 4 + 2√(x-3))\n\n2x + 1 = x + 1 + 2√(x-3)\n\nNow, isolate the radical term:\n\n2√(x-3) = x\n\nSquare both sides again to eliminate the square root:\n\n(2√(x-3))^2 = x^2\n\n4(x-3) = x^2\n\n4x - 12 = x^2\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 12 = 0\n\nNow, we will use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for x:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = 12:\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(1)(12))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 48)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (16 - 48) is negative, there are no real solutions for this equation. However, if we were to consider complex solutions:\n\nx = (4 ± √(-32)) / 2\n\nx = (4 ± 4i√2) / 2\n\nx = 2 ± 2i√2\n\nSo, the complex solutions are x = 2 + 2i√2 and x = 2 - 2i√2."
