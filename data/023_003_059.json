    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let's assume that the temperature profile can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$:\n\n$$ \\theta(x,t) = X(x)T(t) $$\n\nSubstituting this into the partial differential equation, we get:\n\n$$ X(x) \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = 10 T(t) \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} $$\n\nNow, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by $10XT$:\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{10T} \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} $$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call $-\\lambda$:\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{10T} \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X} \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} = -\\lambda $$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$ \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -10\\lambda T(t) $$\n\n$$ \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} = -\\lambda X(x) $$\n\nThe second equation is an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions $X(0) = X(\\pi) = 0$. The solutions are:\n\n$$ X_n(x) = \\sin(nx) $$\n\n$$ \\lambda_n = n^2 $$\n\nfor $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$. The corresponding time-dependent solutions are:\n\n$$ T_n(t) = e^{-10n^2t} $$\n\nThe general solution is a sum of these solutions:\n\n$$ \\theta(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(nx) e^{-10n^2t} $$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we use the initial condition:\n\n$$ g(x) = 2\\sin(2x) + 3\\sin(4x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\sin(nx) $$\n\nComparing the terms, we can see that $A_2 = 2$ and $A_4 = 3$, while all other coefficients are zero. Therefore, the temperature profile is:\n\n$$ \\theta(x,t) = 2\\sin(2x)e^{-40t} + 3\\sin(4x)e^{-160t} $$\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature profile at $t=5$:\n\n$$ \\theta(x,5) = 2\\sin(2x)e^{-200} + 3\\sin(4x)e^{-800} $$"
