    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To find the girth of G, we can use the inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * (number of edges) / (number of vertices)\n\nIn this case, the number of vertices is 10 and the number of edges is 20. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * (20) / (10)\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 4\n\nSince the girth is the length of the shortest cycle, and the smallest possible cycle in a graph is a triangle (with a length of 3), the girth of G must be either 3 or 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum number of edges a graph with 10 vertices and girth 3 can have. A complete graph with 10 vertices (K_10) has 10 * (10 - 1) / 2 = 45 edges. However, if the girth is 3, then the graph cannot be complete. The graph with the maximum number of edges and girth 3 is a complete bipartite graph K_(5,5), which has 5 * 5 = 25 edges.\n\nSince the given graph G has 20 edges, which is less than the maximum number of edges for a graph with 10 vertices and girth 3, it is possible for G to have a girth of 3.\n\nTherefore, the girth of G is 3."
