The study followed a group of 50 patients with the disease who were given the drug. The survival times (in months) from the start of treatment to the time of death or end of the study for each patient are given below:\n\n10, 20, 30, 30, 30, 40, 40, 45, 50, 60, 60, 60, 65, 70, 70, 80, 80, 80, 80, 85, 85, 85, 90, 90, 95, 100, 100, 105, 110, 110, 115, 120, 120, 125, 125, 125, 130, 135, 135, 140, 140, 145, 150, 155, 155, 160, 160, 165, 170, 170, 175, 180, 210\n\nCreate a survival time distribution table and a Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the patients. What is the median survival time? What is the survival rate at 2 years?",
