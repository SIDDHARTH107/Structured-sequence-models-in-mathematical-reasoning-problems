    "message_1": "A right triangle has a base of length 5 cm and a hypotenuse of length 13 cm. What is the length of the other side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, let's call the base a, the other side b, and the hypotenuse c. We are given:\n\na = 5 cm\nc = 13 cm\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem is:\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n(5)^2 + b^2 = (13)^2\n25 + b^2 = 169\n\nNow, solve for b:\n\nb^2 = 169 - 25\nb^2 = 144\nb = âˆš144\nb = 12 cm\n\nSo, the length of the other side of the triangle is 12 cm."
