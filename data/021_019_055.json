    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 2 using the harmony search algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the harmony memory (HM) with 10 random solutions (x values) within a reasonable range, e.g., -10 to 10.\n2. Calculate the fitness (objective function value) of each solution in the HM.\n3. Generate a new solution (x_new) using the harmony memory consideration rate (HMCR = 0.8) and pitch adjusting rate (PAR = 0.5).\n4. Calculate the fitness of the new solution.\n5. If the new solution's fitness is better than the worst solution in the HM, replace the worst solution with the new solution.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for a certain number of iterations or until convergence is reached.\n7. The best solution in the HM is the minimum value of the function.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the harmony search algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**3 - 4*x**2 + 5*x - 2\n\ndef generate_new_solution(hm, hmcr, par):\n    x_new = []\n    for i in range(len(hm[0])):\n        if random.random() < hmcr:\n            x_selected = random.choice(hm)[i]\n            if random.random() < par:\n                x_selected += random.uniform(-0.5, 0.5)\n            x_new.append(x_selected)\n        else:\n            x_new.append(random.uniform(-10, 10))\n    return x_new\n\ndef harmony_search(iterations=1000):\n    hm_size = 10\n    hmcr = 0.8\n    par = 0.5\n\n    # Initialize harmony memory\n    hm = [[random.uniform(-10, 10)] for _ in range(hm_size)]\n    hm_fitness = [f(x[0]) for x in hm]\n\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        x_new = generate_new_solution(hm, hmcr, par)\n        x_new_fitness = f(x_new[0])\n\n        # Replace the worst solution if the new solution is better\n        if x_new_fitness < max(hm_fitness):\n            worst_index = hm_fitness.index(max(hm_fitness))\n            hm[worst_index] = x_new\n            hm_fitness[worst_index] = x_new_fitness\n\n    # Return the best solution\n    best_index = hm_fitness.index(min(hm_fitness))\n    return hm[best_index][0], hm_fitness[best_index]\n\nx_min, f_min = harmony_search()\nprint(\"Minimum value of the function is at x =\", x_min, \"with f(x) =\", f_min)\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum value of the function and the corresponding x value. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm. You can increase the number of iterations for better convergence."
