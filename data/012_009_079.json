    "message_1": "Consider a graph G with 6 vertices and the degree sequence (3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1). Is it possible for such a graph to exist? Justify your answer.",
    "message_2": "To determine if a graph with the given degree sequence exists, we can use the Handshaking Lemma and the Havel-Hakimi algorithm.\n\nThe Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, the sum of the degrees is 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10, which is an even number. This is a necessary condition for the graph to exist, but it's not sufficient on its own.\n\nNext, we can use the Havel-Hakimi algorithm to check if the degree sequence is graphical, meaning that there exists a graph with that degree sequence. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Sort the degree sequence in non-increasing order.\n2. Remove the first number (the highest degree) from the sequence, and reduce the next numbers in the sequence by 1 for each of the removed number's connections.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until either the sequence becomes all zeros (meaning the graph is possible) or the algorithm fails (meaning the graph is not possible).\n\nApplying the Havel-Hakimi algorithm to the given degree sequence:\n\n1. Sorted sequence: (3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1)\n2. Remove 3 and reduce the next 3 numbers by 1: (1, 1, 0, 1, 1)\n3. Sort the remaining sequence: (1, 1, 1, 1, 0)\n4. Remove 1 and reduce the next 1 number by 1: (0, 1, 1, 0)\n5. Sort the remaining sequence: (1, 1, 0, 0)\n6. Remove 1 and reduce the next 1 number by 1: (0, 0, 0)\n\nThe sequence has become all zeros, which means that a graph with the given degree sequence is possible."
