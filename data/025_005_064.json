    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 - y^3 - z^3 = 0, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z, and then find the points where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet f(x, y, z) = x^3 - y^3 - z^3. Then the partial derivatives are:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f/∂y = -3y^2\n∂f/∂z = -3z^2\n\nNow we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n3x^2 = 0\n-3y^2 = 0\n-3z^2 = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we get x = 0. From the second equation, we get y = 0. And from the third equation, we get z = 0.\n\nThus, the only singular point of the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 - y^3 - z^3 = 0 is (0, 0, 0)."
