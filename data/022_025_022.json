    "message_2": "To find the allowed energy levels $E_n$ and the corresponding wave functions $\\psi_n(x)$, we need to solve the Schrödinger equation for the given potential well. We will consider two cases: inside the well ($|x| < a$) and outside the well ($|x| > a$).\n\n1. Inside the well ($|x| < a$):\n\nSince $V(x) = 0$, the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = E\\psi(x)$$\n\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients, and its general solution is:\n\n$$\\psi(x) = A\\sin(kx) + B\\cos(kx)$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants, and $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}}$.\n\n2. Outside the well ($|x| > a$):\n\nIn this region, $V(x) = V_0$, and the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} + V_0\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$$\n\nSince $E < V_0$, we can define a new constant $\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m(V_0 - E)}{\\hbar^2}}$. The general solution for this region is:\n\n$$\\psi(x) = Ce^{\\kappa x} + De^{-\\kappa x}$$\n\nwhere $C$ and $D$ are constants.\n\nNow, we need to apply boundary conditions to find the allowed energy levels and wave functions:\n\n1. Continuity of the wave function at $x = \\pm a$:\n\n$$\\psi(-a) = \\psi(a)$$\n\n2. Continuity of the first derivative of the wave function at $x = \\pm a$:\n\n$$\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}(-a) = \\frac{d\\psi}{dx}(a)$$\n\n3. The wave function must vanish at infinity:\n\n$$\\lim_{x \\to \\pm\\infty} \\psi(x) = 0$$\n\nApplying these boundary conditions, we find that only odd or even solutions are allowed, depending on the parity of $n$. For odd $n$, the wave function is:\n\n$$\\psi_n(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nA_n\\sin(k_nx), & \\text{if }|x| < a \\\\\n0, & \\text{if }|x| > a\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nFor even $n$, the wave function is:\n\n$$\\psi_n(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nB_n\\cos(k_nx), & \\text{if }|x| < a \\\\\n0, & \\text{if }|x| > a\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nThe allowed energy levels are given by:\n\n$$E_n = \\frac{n^2\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2ma^2}$$\n\nwhere $n$ is a positive integer.\n\nFinally, we need to find the normalization constant $C$. Since the wave function is zero outside the well, we only need to integrate inside the well:\n\n$$C = \\int_{-a}^{a} |\\psi_n(x)|^2 dx$$\n\nFor odd $n$:\n\n$$C = \\int_{-a}^{a} (A_n\\sin(k_nx))^2 dx = A_n^2\\int_{-a}^{a} \\sin^2(k_nx) dx$$\n\nFor even $n$:\n\n$$C = \\int_{-a}^{a} (B_n\\cos(k_nx))^2 dx = B_n^2\\int_{-a}^{a} \\cos^2(k_nx) dx$$\n\nIn both cases, we can solve the integral and find the appropriate normalization constant $A_n$ or $B_n$ to make $C = 1$."
