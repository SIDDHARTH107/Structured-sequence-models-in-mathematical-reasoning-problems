    "message_1": "In a game of Spin and Win, a spinner has 12 equally likely colored sections - 6 red sections, 4 blue sections, and 2 green sections. If a player spins the spinner once, what is the probability of winning if the winning section is a blue section? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "The probability of winning if the winning section is a blue section can be calculated by dividing the number of blue sections by the total number of sections.\n\nProbability = (Number of blue sections) / (Total number of sections)\nProbability = 4 blue sections / 12 total sections\nProbability = 1/3\n\nTo convert this to a percentage and round to two decimal places, multiply by 100:\n\nProbability = 1/3 * 100 = 33.33%\n\nSo, the probability of winning if the winning section is a blue section is approximately 33.33%."
