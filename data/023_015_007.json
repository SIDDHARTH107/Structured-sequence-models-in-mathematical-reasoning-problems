The initial condition of the wave is given by: \ny(x,0) = 2sin(10x) + 4cos(20x) - 3sin(30x)\n\nUsing the Fourier transform, determine the displacement of the wave y(x,t) at time t = 0.5 seconds, given that the length of the string is 2 meters.",
    "message_2": "To find the displacement of the wave y(x,t) at time t = 0.5 seconds, we can use the d'Alembert's solution for the wave equation. The d'Alembert's solution is given by:\n\ny(x,t) = 0.5 * (y(x+ct, 0) + y(x-ct, 0))\n\nwhere c is the wave velocity (4 m/s in this case) and y(x,0) is the initial condition of the wave.\n\nAt t = 0.5 seconds, we have:\n\ny(x, 0.5) = 0.5 * (y(x+2, 0) + y(x-2, 0))\n\nNow, we can substitute the initial condition y(x,0) = 2sin(10x) + 4cos(20x) - 3sin(30x) into the equation:\n\ny(x, 0.5) = 0.5 * (2sin(10(x+2)) + 4cos(20(x+2)) - 3sin(30(x+2)) + 2sin(10(x-2)) + 4cos(20(x-2)) - 3sin(30(x-2)))\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\ny(x, 0.5) = sin(10(x-2)) + 2cos(20(x-2)) - 1.5sin(30(x-2)) + sin(10(x+2)) + 2cos(20(x+2)) - 1.5sin(30(x+2))\n\nThis equation represents the displacement of the wave y(x,t) at time t = 0.5 seconds along the string of length 2 meters."
