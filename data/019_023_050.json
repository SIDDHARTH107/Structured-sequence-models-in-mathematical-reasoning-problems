    "message_2": "To find the pattern in the sequence, let's look at the differences between consecutive numbers:\n\n5 - 2 = 3\n10 - 5 = 5\n17 - 10 = 7\n26 - 17 = 9\n37 - 26 = 11\n50 - 37 = 13\n\nThe differences are increasing by 2 each time (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13). So, the next difference should be 13 + 2 = 15. \n\nNow, to find the next number in the sequence, add this difference to the last number in the sequence:\n\n50 + 15 = 65\n\nSo, the next number in the sequence is 65."
