    "message_2": "To find the number of possible combinations for selecting two boxes at a time, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (in this case, 5 boxes) and k is the number of items to be selected (in this case, 2 boxes).\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\n\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2! * 3!)\n\nC(5, 2) = 120 / (2 * 6)\n\nC(5, 2) = 120 / 12\n\nC(5, 2) = 10\n\nSo there are 10 possible combinations for selecting two boxes at a time from the 5 boxes labeled A, B, C, D, and E."
