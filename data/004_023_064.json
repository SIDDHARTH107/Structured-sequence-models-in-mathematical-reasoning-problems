    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the two curves, we first need to find the points of intersection. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 - 1 = -x + 3\n\nRearrange the equation to find the x values:\n\nx^2 + x - 4 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x + 2)(x - 2) = 0\n\nThe points of intersection are x = -2 and x = 2. However, since we are only considering the interval [-1, 2], we will only use the intersection point x = 2. Now we will find the corresponding y values for the intersection points:\n\ny = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\ny = -2 + 3 = 1\n\nSo the point of intersection within the interval is (2, 1).\n\nNow we will set up the integral to find the area between the curves. Since the linear function y = -x + 3 is above the quadratic function y = x^2 - 1 in the given interval, we will subtract the quadratic function from the linear function:\n\nArea = ∫[-1, 2] (-x + 3 - (x^2 - 1)) dx\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\nArea = ∫[-1, 2] (-x + 4 - x^2) dx\n\nNow integrate:\n\nArea = [-1/2 * x^2 + 4x - 1/3 * x^3] evaluated from -1 to 2\n\nPlug in the limits of integration:\n\nArea = (-1/2 * 2^2 + 4 * 2 - 1/3 * 2^3) - (-1/2 * (-1)^2 + 4 * (-1) - 1/3 * (-1)^3)\n\nArea = (-1/2 * 4 + 8 - 8/3) - (-1/2 + 4 + 1/3)\n\nArea = (-2 + 8 - 8/3) - (-1/2 + 12/3 + 1/3)\n\nArea = (6 - 8/3) - (11/6)\n\nArea = (18 - 16)/3 - 11/6\n\nArea = 2/3 - 11/6\n\nArea = (4 - 11)/6\n\nArea = -7/6\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nArea = 7/6 square units\n\nSo the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 - 1 and y = -x + 3 over the interval [-1, 2] is 7/6 square units."
