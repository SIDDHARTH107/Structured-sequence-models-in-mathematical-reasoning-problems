    "message_1": "A company has found that the probability a certain machine will break down in any given month is 0.15. What is the probability that the machine will break down within the next two months?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability is the probability that an event does not occur, which is equal to 1 minus the probability that the event does occur.\n\nLet A be the event that the machine breaks down in the first month, and B be the event that the machine breaks down in the second month. We want to find the probability of A or B occurring.\n\nThe probability that the machine does not break down in the first month is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. Similarly, the probability that the machine does not break down in the second month is also 0.85.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the machine does not break down in both the first and second months. This is the probability of the intersection of the complementary events, which is equal to the product of their probabilities:\n\nP(not A and not B) = P(not A) * P(not B) = 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225\n\nNow, we can find the probability that the machine breaks down within the next two months by finding the complementary probability of the machine not breaking down in both months:\n\nP(A or B) = 1 - P(not A and not B) = 1 - 0.7225 = 0.2775\n\nSo, the probability that the machine will break down within the next two months is 0.2775 or 27.75%."
