    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form 2^n - 1, where n is a positive integer. To find the smallest Mersenne prime greater than 100, we can start by testing values of n until we find a prime number.\n\nFor n = 5, 2^5 - 1 = 31 (not greater than 100)\nFor n = 6, 2^6 - 1 = 63 (not prime)\nFor n = 7, 2^7 - 1 = 127 (prime)\n\nSo, the smallest Mersenne prime number greater than 100 is 127."
