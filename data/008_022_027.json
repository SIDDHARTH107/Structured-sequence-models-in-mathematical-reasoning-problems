    "message_2": "First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations:\n\n```\n| 10  5.5  -6  | 12.5 |\n| 15  8.5  -9  | 19.5 |\n| 20  11.5 -12 | 26.5 |\n```\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination to obtain an upper triangular matrix:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 10 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n| 1  0.55  -0.6 | 1.25 |\n| 15  8.5  -9   | 19.5 |\n| 20  11.5 -12  | 26.5 |\n```\n\n2. Replace the second row with (-15 * first row + second row):\n\n```\n| 1  0.55  -0.6 |  1.25 |\n| 0  0.75  -1.5 |  0.75 |\n| 20 11.5 -12   | 26.5  |\n```\n\n3. Replace the third row with (-20 * first row + third row):\n\n```\n| 1  0.55  -0.6 |  1.25 |\n| 0  0.75  -1.5 |  0.75 |\n| 0  0     0    |  0    |\n```\n\nNotice that the third row is now all zeros, which means that the system of linear equations is dependent. This means that there are infinitely many solutions to this system, and we cannot find unique values for x, y, and z.\n\nHowever, we can express the solution in terms of a free variable. Let's solve the remaining system of linear equations:\n\n```\nx + 0.55y - 0.6z = 1.25\n0.75y - 1.5z = 0.75\n```\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express y in terms of z:\n\ny = 2z\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\nx + 0.55(2z) - 0.6z = 1.25\nx + 1.1z - 0.6z = 1.25\nx + 0.5z = 1.25\n\nNow we can express x in terms of z as well:\n\nx = 1.25 - 0.5z\n\nSo the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\nx = 1.25 - 0.5z\ny = 2z\nz = z\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
