    "message_1": "Consider a curve in three-dimensional space defined by the vector-valued function given by r(t) = <3t, 2cos(t), 2sin(t)>. Suppose we have a vector v = <1, 0, 0> located at the point (0,2,0) on the curve. Find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve.",
    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve, we first need to find the tangent vector T(t) of the curve r(t) = <3t, 2cos(t), 2sin(t)>.\n\nTo find the tangent vector, we differentiate r(t) with respect to t:\n\ndr/dt = <d(3t)/dt, d(2cos(t))/dt, d(2sin(t))/dt> = <3, -2sin(t), 2cos(t)>.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that the transported vector v(t) remains parallel to the tangent vector T(t) at each point along the curve. This means that the derivative of v(t) with respect to t should be proportional to the tangent vector T(t). In other words, we need to find a function v(t) such that:\n\ndv(t)/dt = k(t) * T(t),\n\nwhere k(t) is a scalar function of t.\n\nSince the initial vector v is <1, 0, 0>, we can write v(t) as:\n\nv(t) = <1, f(t), g(t)>,\n\nwhere f(t) and g(t) are functions of t that we need to determine.\n\nNow, we differentiate v(t) with respect to t:\n\ndv(t)/dt = <0, df(t)/dt, dg(t)/dt>.\n\nComparing this with the tangent vector T(t) = <3, -2sin(t), 2cos(t)>, we can write:\n\n0 = 3 * k(t),\ndf(t)/dt = -2sin(t) * k(t),\ndg(t)/dt = 2cos(t) * k(t).\n\nFrom the first equation, we can see that k(t) = 0. This means that the transported vector v(t) does not change along the curve. Therefore, the parallel transport of the vector v along the curve is:\n\nv(t) = <1, 0, 0> for all t."
