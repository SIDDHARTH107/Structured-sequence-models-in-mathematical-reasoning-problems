    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least two accidents occurring, we can first find the probability of 0 accidents and 1 accident occurring, and then subtract these probabilities from 1.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula: P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k accidents occurring\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the number of cars rented (15)\n- k is the number of accidents (0, 1, or 2)\n- p is the probability of an accident occurring for a single car (0.1)\n- (1-p) is the probability of an accident not occurring for a single car (0.9)\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of 0 accidents occurring (k=0):\nP(X = 0) = C(15, 0) * 0.1^0 * 0.9^(15-0)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * 0.9^15 ≈ 0.20589113\n\nNext, let's find the probability of 1 accident occurring (k=1):\nP(X = 1) = C(15, 1) * 0.1^1 * 0.9^(15-1)\nP(X = 1) = 15 * 0.1 * 0.9^14 ≈ 0.38742049\n\nNow, let's find the probability of at least 2 accidents occurring:\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - 0.20589113 - 0.38742049 ≈ 0.40668838\n\nSo, the probability of at least two accidents occurring is approximately 0.4067 or 40.67%."
