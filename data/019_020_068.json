    "message_1": "What is the smallest 3-SAT problem that is known to be NP-complete?\n\nHint: A 3-SAT problem is a decision problem in which each clause consists of exactly three literals, and the goal is to determine if there exists an assignment of truth values to the variables that satisfies all clauses. NP-complete problems are those that are at least as hard as any other problem in NP.",
    "message_2": "The smallest 3-SAT problem that is known to be NP-complete is one with a single clause containing three distinct literals. This is because any smaller instance would either have less than three literals or have repeated literals, which would no longer be a 3-SAT problem.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that a single clause 3-SAT problem is trivially solvable, as you can simply assign truth values to the variables that satisfy the clause. The NP-completeness of 3-SAT arises when you have multiple clauses with multiple variables, as finding a satisfying assignment becomes more complex and requires checking a potentially exponential number of possibilities."
