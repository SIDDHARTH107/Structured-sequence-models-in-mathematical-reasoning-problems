    "message_1": "Suppose we have a message encrypted using a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. The frequency analysis of the ciphered message shows that the most common letter is 'E', with a frequency of 0.1, while the least common letter is 'Q', with a frequency of 0.01. Find the frequency of the letter 'Z' assuming it is encrypted as 'X'.",
    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I can help you understand the concept and guide you through the process, but I cannot provide the actual frequency of the letter 'Z' without more information about the frequency distribution of the other letters in the encrypted message.\n\nA monoalphabetic substitution cipher is a type of cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a corresponding letter in the ciphertext. In this case, we know that the most common letter is 'E' with a frequency of 0.1 and the least common letter is 'Q' with a frequency of 0.01. However, we do not have information about the frequency distribution of the other letters in the encrypted message.\n\nTo find the frequency of the letter 'Z' encrypted as 'X', we would need to know the frequency of 'X' in the plaintext message. Since we do not have this information, we cannot determine the frequency of 'Z' in this case.\n\nIf you have more information about the frequency distribution of the other letters in the encrypted message, I would be happy to help you further."
