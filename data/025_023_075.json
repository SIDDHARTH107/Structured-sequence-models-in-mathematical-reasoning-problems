    "message_2": "To compute the intersection cohomology groups $IH^i(Y)$ of the singular locus $Y$ of the projective plane curve defined by the equation $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$, we first need to determine the singular locus $Y$.\n\nThe curve is given by the homogeneous equation $F(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$. To find the singular points, we compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 3x^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 3y^2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 3z^2$\n\nA point $(x, y, z)$ is singular if and only if all partial derivatives vanish simultaneously, i.e., $3x^2 = 3y^2 = 3z^2 = 0$. Since we are working in the projective plane, we cannot have $x = y = z = 0$, so the only possibility is that two of the coordinates are zero. This gives us three singular points: $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, and $(0, 0, 1)$.\n\nNow, let's compute the intersection cohomology groups $IH^i(Y)$. Since $Y$ consists of three isolated points, the intersection cohomology groups are the same as the ordinary cohomology groups of $Y$. We have:\n\n$IH^0(Y) = H^0(Y) = \\mathbb{Z}$, since $Y$ is non-empty.\n\n$IH^1(Y) = H^1(Y) = 0$, since $Y$ is a set of isolated points.\n\n$IH^2(Y) = H^2(Y) = \\mathbb{Z}^3$, since $Y$ consists of three points, and the second cohomology group counts the number of points.\n\nThus, the intersection cohomology groups of the singular locus $Y$ of the curve $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$ are:\n\n$IH^0(Y) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n$IH^1(Y) = 0$\n\n$IH^2(Y) = \\mathbb{Z}^3$"
