    "message_1": "Consider a metal rod of length 10 cm with a cross-sectional area of 2 cm^2. It is initially at a uniform temperature of 200°C. At time t=0, one end of the rod is suddenly cooled to 25°C and the other end is insulated. The thermal diffusivity of the metal is 0.1 cm^2/s. \n\na) Write down the heat diffusion equation for this problem.\n\nb) Solve the heat diffusion equation to find the temperature distribution in the metal rod as a function of time and position.\n\nc) What is the temperature at the midpoint of the rod at t=10 seconds?",
    "message_2": "a) The heat diffusion equation, also known as the one-dimensional unsteady-state heat conduction equation, is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the rod, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nFor this problem, we have the following boundary and initial conditions:\n\nBoundary conditions:\nT(0, t) = 25°C (cooled end)\n∂T/∂x (10, t) = 0 (insulated end)\n\nInitial condition:\nT(x, 0) = 200°C (uniform initial temperature)\n\nb) To solve the heat diffusion equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nT(x, t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat diffusion equation, we get:\n\nX(x)∂T(t)/∂t = α T(t)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we obtain:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = (1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x²\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on position, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we denote as -λ²:\n\n(1/αT)∂T(t)/∂t = -λ²\n(1/X)∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations to solve:\n\nFor X(x):\n∂²X(x)/∂x² = -λ²X(x)\n\nThe general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nT(0, t) = 25°C => X(0) = 25 => A = 25\n\n∂T/∂x (10, t) = 0 => ∂X/∂x (10) = 0 => -25λ*sin(λ*10) = 0\n\nSince λ cannot be zero, we must have sin(λ*10) = 0, which implies:\n\nλ*10 = nπ, where n is an integer\n\nSo, λ = nπ/10, and the solution for X(x) becomes:\n\nX(x) = 25*cos(nπx/10)\n\nFor T(t):\n∂T(t)/∂t = -αλ²T(t)\n\nThe general solution for T(t) is:\n\nT(t) = C*exp(-αλ²t)\n\nNow, we combine the solutions for X(x) and T(t) and sum over all possible values of n:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ[25*cos(nπx/10)*C_n*exp(-α(nπ/10)²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients C_n, we use the initial condition T(x, 0) = 200°C:\n\n200 = Σ[25*cos(nπx/10)*C_n]\n\nSince the initial condition is independent of x, we can use the orthogonality property of cosine functions to find C_n:\n\nC_n = (2/10) * ∫[cos(nπx/10)*(200-25)]dx from 0 to 10\n\nC_n = (1/5) * (200-25) * [sin(nπx/10)/(nπ/10)] from 0 to 10\n\nFor n = 0, C_0 = 175/5 = 35\n\nFor n > 0, C_n = (1/5) * 175 * [sin(nπ)/nπ - sin(0)/nπ] = (175/nπ) * [sin(nπ) - 0] = 0\n\nSo, the only non-zero coefficient is C_0, and the temperature distribution in the metal rod is:\n\nT(x, t) = 25 + 35*exp(-α(0)²t) = 25 + 35 = 60°C (since the insulated end doesn't allow heat transfer)\n\nc) To find the temperature at the midpoint of the rod (x = 5 cm) at t = 10 seconds, we can use the temperature distribution function:\n\nT(5, 10) = 60°C\n\nThe temperature at the midpoint of the rod at t = 10 seconds is 60°C."
