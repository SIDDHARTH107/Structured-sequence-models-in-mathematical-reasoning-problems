    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve process to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the length of each side of the Koch curve is multiplied by 4/3. \n\nAfter the 4th iteration, the length of each side of the Koch curve will be:\n\nInitial length * (4/3)^4 = 1 * (4/3)^4 = 256/81\n\nSince the Koch island is an equilateral triangle, the total length of the Koch island after the 4th iteration will be:\n\n3 * (256/81) = 768/81 units"
