    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x with period 2π over the interval [-π, π], we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ[a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nThe coefficients a_n and b_n are given by the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx (from -L to L)\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)]dx (from -L to L)\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx)]dx (from -L to L)\n\nFor our problem, L = π, so:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[x]dx (from -π to π)\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * cos(nx)]dx (from -π to π)\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * sin(nx)]dx (from -π to π)\n\nNow, we compute the integrals:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [x^2/2] (from -π to π) = 0\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * cos(nx)]dx (from -π to π)\nUsing integration by parts, let u = x and dv = cos(nx)dx. Then, du = dx and v = (1/n) * sin(nx).\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * x * sin(nx) - (1/n^2) * ∫[sin(nx)dx]] (from -π to π)\na_n = (1/π) * [(1/n) * x * sin(nx) + (1/n^3) * cos(nx)] (from -π to π)\na_n = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0 and cos(nπ) = 1 or -1)\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[x * sin(nx)]dx (from -π to π)\nUsing integration by parts, let u = x and dv = sin(nx)dx. Then, du = dx and v = (-1/n) * cos(nx).\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * x * cos(nx) - (-1/n^2) * ∫[cos(nx)dx]] (from -π to π)\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * x * cos(nx) - (-1/n^2) * (1/n) * sin(nx)] (from -π to π)\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-1/n) * x * cos(nx) + (1/n^3) * sin(nx)] (from -π to π)\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n^3) * sin(nπ) - (1/n) * π * cos(nπ) + (1/n^3) * sin(-nπ) + (1/n) * π * cos(-nπ)]\nb_n = (1/π) * [2 * (1/n) * π * cos(nπ)] (since sin(nπ) = 0 and cos(-nπ) = cos(nπ))\nb_n = (2/n) * cos(nπ)\n\nSo, the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x with period 2π over the interval [-π, π] is:\n\nf(x) = Σ[(2/n) * cos(nπ) * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity."
