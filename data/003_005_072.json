    "message_2": "To find the value of x in degrees using the inverse trigonometric function, we will use the arcsin (also known as the inverse sine) function. \n\nx = arcsin(0.6)\n\nNow, we need to convert the result from radians to degrees. To do this, we will use the following conversion formula:\n\ndegrees = radians * (180 / π)\n\nFirst, find the value of x in radians:\n\nx ≈ arcsin(0.6) ≈ 0.6435 radians\n\nNow, convert the radians to degrees:\n\nx ≈ 0.6435 * (180 / π) ≈ 36.87 degrees\n\nSo, the value of x is approximately 36.87 degrees. Keep in mind that this is the principal value, and sine function is periodic, so there are infinitely many solutions for x. You can find other solutions by adding or subtracting multiples of 360 degrees for the general solution."
