    "message_1": "Suppose you and your opponent are playing matching pennies. If you both choose Heads, then you will get paid $1 and your opponent will owe you $1. If you both choose Tails, then you owe your opponent $1 and you get paid $1. If you choose Heads and your opponent chooses Tails, then you owe your opponent $2 and if you choose Tails and your opponent chooses Heads, then your opponent owes you $2. If you play this game 10 times with your opponent, what strategy would you use to maximize your winnings?",
    "message_2": "In the matching pennies game, the best strategy to maximize your winnings is to use a mixed strategy, where you randomly choose Heads or Tails with equal probability (50% chance of choosing Heads and 50% chance of choosing Tails). This is because the game is a zero-sum game with no pure strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nBy choosing Heads or Tails with equal probability, you make it difficult for your opponent to predict your choice and exploit it. This mixed strategy will, on average, result in an expected value of zero for both players over multiple games, as the gains and losses will balance out.\n\nTo implement this strategy over 10 games, you can use a random number generator or another method to ensure you are choosing Heads or Tails with equal probability in each game."
