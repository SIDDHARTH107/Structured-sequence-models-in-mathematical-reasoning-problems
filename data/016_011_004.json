    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is a self-replicating fractal pattern, where each square is replaced by a larger square made up of five smaller squares in a cross pattern. The total number of squares at each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal squares = 5^(iteration number)\n\nFor the 5th iteration, the total number of squares is:\n\nTotal squares = 5^5 = 3125\n\nSo, there are 3125 squares in the Vicsek fractal at its 5th iteration."
