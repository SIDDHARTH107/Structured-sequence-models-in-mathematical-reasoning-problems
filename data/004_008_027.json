    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 5 at the point (2, 9), we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 5 is:\n\nf'(x) = 2x + 3\n\nNow, we evaluate f'(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point (2, 9) is 7."
