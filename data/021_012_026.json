The production cost per unit of product, C, can be modeled by function C(x,y) = 10x^2 + 20y^2 + 10xy + 50x + 60y + 100. The quality of the product can be measured by function Q(x,y) = 3x + 6y - xy - 2. Use quasi-Newton methods to find the lowest production cost subject to a minimum quality level of Q = 10.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method, which is a popular quasi-Newton method for solving optimization problems. We will first convert the problem into an unconstrained optimization problem by introducing a Lagrange multiplier.\n\nLet L(x, y, λ) = C(x, y) - λ(Q(x, y) - 10), where λ is the Lagrange multiplier. Our goal is to minimize L(x, y, λ) with respect to x and y.\n\nL(x, y, λ) = 10x^2 + 20y^2 + 10xy + 50x + 60y + 100 - λ(3x + 6y - xy - 12)\n\nNow, we need to find the gradient of L(x, y, λ) with respect to x, y, and λ:\n\n∇L(x, y, λ) = (∂L/∂x, ∂L/∂y, ∂L/∂λ)\n\n∂L/∂x = 20x + 10y + 50 - 3λ + λy\n∂L/∂y = 40y + 10x + 60 - 6λ - λx\n∂L/∂λ = 3x + 6y - xy - 12\n\nNow, we will use the BFGS method to find the minimum of L(x, y, λ). We start with an initial guess (x0, y0, λ0) and an initial Hessian matrix approximation H0. In this case, we can choose (x0, y0, λ0) = (1, 1, 1) and H0 as the identity matrix.\n\nWe then iteratively update the Hessian matrix approximation and the variables (x, y, λ) using the BFGS update formula until convergence. The BFGS update formula is:\n\n1. Compute the search direction: p_k = -H_k * ∇L(x_k, y_k, λ_k)\n2. Perform a line search to find the step size α_k that minimizes L(x_k + α_k * p_k)\n3. Update the variables: (x_{k+1}, y_{k+1}, λ_{k+1}) = (x_k, y_k, λ_k) + α_k * p_k\n4. Compute the difference in variables: s_k = α_k * p_k\n5. Compute the difference in gradients: y_k = ∇L(x_{k+1}, y_{k+1}, λ_{k+1}) - ∇L(x_k, y_k, λ_k)\n6. Update the Hessian matrix approximation: H_{k+1} = H_k + (y_k * y_k^T) / (y_k^T * s_k) - (H_k * s_k * s_k^T * H_k) / (s_k^T * H_k * s_k)\n\nAfter convergence, we obtain the optimal values of x, y, and λ. The lowest production cost subject to a minimum quality level of Q = 10 can be found by plugging the optimal values of x and y into the cost function C(x, y)."
