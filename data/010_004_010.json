    "message_1": "Suppose X is a topological space and let's define a function f: X -> R which is continuous and X is compact. If f has a maximum value of 5 and a minimum value of -2, what is the range of f?",
    "message_2": "Since f is a continuous function on a compact space X, by the Extreme Value Theorem, f attains its maximum and minimum values on X. Given that the maximum value of f is 5 and the minimum value is -2, the range of f is the set of all values that f takes on between -2 and 5, inclusive. Therefore, the range of f is the closed interval [-2, 5]."
