    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 8. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a subgroup of order 4, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Since the order of P is 4, P is either isomorphic to C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group).\n\nCase 1: P is isomorphic to C4.\nIn this case, P has one element of order 2, say x. Since G has order 8 and P has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the index of P in G is 2, which implies that P is a normal subgroup of G. Let y be an element in G but not in P. Then the order of y is either 2 or 4. If the order of y is 4, then G is generated by x and y, and G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4. If the order of y is 2, then G is generated by x and y, and G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nCase 2: P is isomorphic to V4.\nIn this case, P has three elements of order 2, say x, y, and z. Since G has order 8 and P has order 4, by Lagrange's theorem, the index of P in G is 2, which implies that P is a normal subgroup of G. Let a be an element in G but not in P. Then the order of a is either 2 or 4. If the order of a is 2, then a must be in P, which is a contradiction. So the order of a must be 4. Then G is generated by a and P, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8.\n\nIn conclusion, G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4."
