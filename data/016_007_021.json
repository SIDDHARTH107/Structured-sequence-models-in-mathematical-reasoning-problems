    "message_2": "The hint states that in each iteration, the number of squares is multiplied by 20. \n\n1st iteration: 1 * 20 = 20 squares\n2nd iteration: 20 * 20 = 400 squares\n3rd iteration: 400 * 20 = 8000 squares\n\nSo, the total number of squares in the 3rd iteration of the Menger sponge is 8000."
