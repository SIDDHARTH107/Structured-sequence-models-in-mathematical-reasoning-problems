    "message_2": "To determine if the sequence $(x_n)$ converges in the topological space $(X, \\tau)$, we need to check if there exists a point $x \\in X$ such that for every open set $U \\in \\tau$ containing $x$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, $x_n \\in U$.\n\nFirst, let's list out the first few terms of the sequence $(x_n)$:\n\n$$x_1 = 2, x_2 = 3, x_3 = 4, x_4 = 1, x_5 = 2, x_6 = 3, x_7 = 4, x_8 = 1, \\dots$$\n\nNow, let's consider the possible limit points in $X$. Since the sequence $(x_n)$ takes values in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, the limit point, if it exists, must be in this set.\n\n1. If $x = 1$, then for any open set $U \\in \\tau$ containing $1$, we have $U = \\{1\\}$ or $U = \\{1, 2\\}$ or $U = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ or $U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. In each of these cases, there exists an $N$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, $x_n \\in U$. For example, if $U = \\{1\\}$, we can choose $N = 4$; if $U = \\{1, 2\\}$, we can choose $N = 1$; and so on. Therefore, the sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $1$ in $(X, \\tau)$.\n\n2. If $x = 2$, then for any open set $U \\in \\tau$ containing $2$, we have $U = \\{1, 2\\}$ or $U = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ or $U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. In each of these cases, there exists an $N$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, $x_n \\in U$. For example, if $U = \\{1, 2\\}$, we can choose $N = 1$; if $U = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, we can choose $N = 1$; and so on. Therefore, the sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $2$ in $(X, \\tau)$.\n\n3. If $x = 3$, then for any open set $U \\in \\tau$ containing $3$, we have $U = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ or $U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. In each of these cases, there exists an $N$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, $x_n \\in U$. For example, if $U = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, we can choose $N = 2$; if $U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, we can choose $N = 1$; and so on. Therefore, the sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $3$ in $(X, \\tau)$.\n\n4. If $x = 4$, then for any open set $U \\in \\tau$ containing $4$, we have $U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. In this case, there exists an $N$ such that for all $n \\geq N$, $x_n \\in U$. For example, if $U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, we can choose $N = 1$. Therefore, the sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $4$ in $(X, \\tau)$.\n\nSince the sequence $(x_n)$ converges to all points in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ in the topological space $(X, \\tau)$, we can conclude that the sequence $(x_n)$ does not have a unique limit point in $(X, \\tau)$. Thus, the sequence $(x_n)$ does not converge in the topological space $(X, \\tau)$."
