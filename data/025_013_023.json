    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian matrix of the curve given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 5$, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y.\n\nLet $F(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 5$. Then, the curve is defined by the equation $F(x, y) = 0$.\n\nNow, we find the partial derivatives of F with respect to x and y:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\nNow, we can form the Jacobian matrix J:\n\n$J = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2x & 2y \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the Jacobian matrix at the point (1, 2):\n\n$J(1, 2) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2(1) & 2(2) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$"
