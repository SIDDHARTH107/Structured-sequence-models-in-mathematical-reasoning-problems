Here, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate z from the first two equations:\n\n(2) - (1): (2x + 3y + z) - (x + y + z) = 20 - 10\nx + 2y = 10 (3)\n\nNow, let's eliminate z from the second and third equations:\n\n(3) - 2*(2): (3x + 4y + 2z) - 2*(2x + 3y + z) = 26 - 2*20\n3x + 4y + 2z - 4x - 6y - 2z = -14\n-x - 2y = -14 (4)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\nx + 2y = 10 (3)\n-x - 2y = -14 (4)\n\nAdd equations (3) and (4):\n\nx + 2y - x - 2y = 10 - 14\n0 = -4\n\nThis result indicates that there is no solution to this system of linear equations, as the equations are inconsistent."
