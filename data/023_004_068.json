The Fourier transform F(ω) of a function f(x) is given by:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-jωx)] dx, where the integral is taken over the entire real line (-∞, ∞), j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1), and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nFor the given function f(x) = e^(-2|x|), we need to consider two cases due to the absolute value:\n\n1) x ≥ 0: f(x) = e^(-2x)\n2) x < 0: f(x) = e^(2x)\n\nNow, we can compute the Fourier transform for each case and then sum them up.\n\nCase 1 (x ≥ 0):\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[e^(-2x) * e^(-jωx)] dx, with the integral taken from 0 to ∞.\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts:\n\nu = e^(-2x), dv = e^(-jωx) dx\ndu = -2e^(-2x) dx, v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωx)\n\nNow, we can compute the integral:\n\nF1(ω) = uv|_(0 to ∞) - ∫(v du)\n\nF1(ω) = [(-1/jω)e^(-2x)e^(-jωx)]|_(0 to ∞) - ∫[(-1/jω)(-2)e^(-2x)e^(-jωx) dx]\n\nF1(ω) = [(-1/jω)e^(-2x)e^(-jωx)]|_(0 to ∞) + (2/jω)∫[e^(-2x)e^(-jωx) dx]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the first term at the limits:\n\nlim(x->∞) [(-1/jω)e^(-2x)e^(-jωx)] = 0\n(-1/jω)e^(0) = -1/jω\n\nSo, the first term is -1/jω. Now, we have:\n\nF1(ω) = -1/jω + (2/jω)F1(ω)\n\nThis is a recursive relationship, and we can solve it by multiplying both sides by jω:\n\n-1 = 2F1(ω)\n\nF1(ω) = -1/2\n\nCase 2 (x < 0):\n\nF2(ω) = ∫[e^(2x) * e^(-jωx)] dx, with the integral taken from -∞ to 0.\n\nWe can follow the same steps as in Case 1:\n\nu = e^(2x), dv = e^(-jωx) dx\ndu = 2e^(2x) dx, v = (-1/jω)e^(-jωx)\n\nF2(ω) = uv|_(-∞ to 0) - ∫(v du)\n\nF2(ω) = [(-1/jω)e^(2x)e^(-jωx)]|_(-∞ to 0) - ∫[(-1/jω)(2)e^(2x)e^(-jωx) dx]\n\nF2(ω) = [(-1/jω)e^(2x)e^(-jωx)]|_(-∞ to 0) + (2/jω)∫[e^(2x)e^(-jωx) dx]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the first term at the limits:\n\nlim(x->-∞) [(-1/jω)e^(2x)e^(-jωx)] = 0\n(-1/jω)e^(0) = -1/jω\n\nSo, the first term is -1/jω. Now, we have:\n\nF2(ω) = -1/jω + (2/jω)F2(ω)\n\nThis is a recursive relationship, and we can solve it by multiplying both sides by jω:\n\n-1 = 2F2(ω)\n\nF2(ω) = -1/2\n\nNow, we can sum up the Fourier transforms for both cases:\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω) = -1/2 - 1/2 = -1\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = e^(-2|x|) in the frequency domain is F(ω) = -1."
