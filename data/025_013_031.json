    "message_2": "To determine the Jacobian of the algebraic curve C: y^2 = x^3 + x^2 - x, we first need to find the partial derivatives of the curve with respect to x and y. Let F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - x^2 + x. Then, the Jacobian matrix J is given by:\n\nJ = [dF/dx, dF/dy]\n\nNow, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\ndF/dx = -3x^2 - 2x + 1\ndF/dy = 2y\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix J is:\n\nJ = [-3x^2 - 2x + 1, 2y]\n\nNow, we need to find the order of the Jacobian. The order of the Jacobian is the number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix. In this case, we have a 1x2 matrix, so the order is 1."
