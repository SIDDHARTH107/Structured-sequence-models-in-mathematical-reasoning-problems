    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 3 using Newton's method, we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the first derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 10x + 7\nf''(x) = 6x - 10\n\nNow, we will use Newton's method to find the critical points. Newton's method formula is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nWe are given x0 = 1, and we will iterate until the absolute difference between two consecutive approximations is less than 0.001.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - f'(x0) / f''(x0) = 1 - (3(1)^2 - 10(1) + 7) / (6(1) - 10) = 1 - (-0) / (-4) = 1\n\nSince the absolute difference between x0 and x1 is 0, we have already reached the desired accuracy, and there is no need for further iterations. The critical point is x = 1.\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point corresponds to a minimum value. We do this by checking the second derivative at this point:\n\nf''(1) = 6(1) - 10 = -4\n\nSince f''(1) < 0, the critical point x = 1 corresponds to a local maximum, not a minimum.\n\nHowever, if we are looking for the global minimum value of the function, we can still use the critical point to help us. Since the function is a cubic polynomial, it has only one critical point, and the function will approach negative infinity as x goes to negative infinity and positive infinity as x goes to positive infinity. Therefore, the global minimum value will occur at one of the endpoints of the domain.\n\nIn this case, since the critical point corresponds to a local maximum, the global minimum value will occur either to the left or the right of the critical point. We can check the values of the function at x = 1 - 0.001 and x = 1 + 0.001 to determine the direction in which the function decreases:\n\nf(1 - 0.001) = (1 - 0.001)^3 - 5(1 - 0.001)^2 + 7(1 - 0.001) - 3 ≈ -0.002999\nf(1 + 0.001) = (1 + 0.001)^3 - 5(1 + 0.001)^2 + 7(1 + 0.001) - 3 ≈ -0.002001\n\nSince f(1 + 0.001) < f(1 - 0.001), the function decreases to the right of the critical point. Therefore, the global minimum value will occur as x goes to positive infinity. However, we cannot find an exact minimum value or corresponding x-value using Newton's method in this case, as the function does not have a global minimum value on a closed interval."
