    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. Each product requires a certain number of labor hours and materials to produce. The company has 1000 labor hours and 600 units of materials available each month. Product A requires 4 labor hours and 2 units of materials, while Product B requires 6 labor hours and 3 units of materials. The profit from Product A is $50 per unit and the profit from Product B is $60 per unit. The company wants to maximize its profit. What is the maximum profit the company can earn each month?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The constraints for labor hours and materials can be written as:\n\n4x + 6y ≤ 1000 (labor hours)\n2x + 3y ≤ 600 (materials)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nProfit = 50x + 60y\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we need to find the feasible region defined by the constraints and then evaluate the objective function at the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\ny ≤ (1000 - 4x) / 6\ny ≤ (600 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we'll find the vertices of the feasible region by setting the inequalities to equalities and solving for x and y:\n\n1) x = 0, y = (1000 - 4x) / 6 => y = 1000 / 6 = 166.67\n2) x = 0, y = (600 - 2x) / 3 => y = 600 / 3 = 200\n3) y = 0, x = 1000 / 4 = 250\n4) Intersection of the two lines: 4x + 6y = 1000 and 2x + 3y = 600\n\nMultiplying the second equation by 2, we get 4x + 6y = 1200. Subtracting the first equation from this, we get:\n\n1200 - 1000 = 200\ny = 200 / 6 = 33.33\nx = (1000 - 6 * 33.33) / 4 = 166.67\n\nSo, the vertices of the feasible region are (0, 166.67), (0, 200), (250, 0), and (166.67, 33.33).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at these vertices:\n\n1) Profit(0, 166.67) = 50 * 0 + 60 * 166.67 = $10,000.20\n2) Profit(0, 200) = 50 * 0 + 60 * 200 = $12,000\n3) Profit(250, 0) = 50 * 250 + 60 * 0 = $12,500\n4) Profit(166.67, 33.33) = 50 * 166.67 + 60 * 33.33 = $10,000.10\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 250 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B, resulting in a profit of $12,500 per month."
