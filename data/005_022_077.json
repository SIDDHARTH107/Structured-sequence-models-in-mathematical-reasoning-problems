The scores are as follows:\n    \n    89, 93, 82, 91, 87, 84, 90, 93, 79, 92, 85, 93\n    \nCalculate the median score, the trimmed mean score after removing the top and bottom scores, and the median absolute deviation from the median for this data set. Which measure of central tendency and spread is more appropriate for this data set and why?",
    "message_2": "First, let's arrange the scores in ascending order:\n\n    79, 82, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 93, 93\n\n1. Median score:\nSince there are 12 scores (an even number), the median is the average of the two middle scores (6th and 7th scores).\n\nMedian = (89 + 90) / 2 = 179 / 2 = 89.5\n\n2. Trimmed mean score:\nTo calculate the trimmed mean, we remove the highest and lowest scores (79 and 93) and then calculate the mean of the remaining scores.\n\nTrimmed mean = (82 + 84 + 85 + 87 + 89 + 90 + 91 + 92 + 93 + 93) / 10 = 887 / 10 = 88.7\n\n3. Median absolute deviation (MAD) from the median:\nTo calculate the MAD, we first find the absolute deviations from the median for each score, and then find the median of these absolute deviations.\n\nAbsolute deviations: |79-89.5|, |82-89.5|, |84-89.5|, |85-89.5|, |87-89.5|, |89-89.5|, |90-89.5|, |91-89.5|, |92-89.5|, |93-89.5|, |93-89.5|, |93-89.5|\n\nAbsolute deviations: 10.5, 7.5, 5.5, 4.5, 2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5\n\nArranging the absolute deviations in ascending order: 0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 7.5, 10.5\n\nMedian of absolute deviations (MAD) = (3.5 + 3.5) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5\n\nNow, let's discuss which measure of central tendency and spread is more appropriate for this data set.\n\nThe median (89.5) and trimmed mean (88.7) are quite close, suggesting that there are no extreme outliers in the data set. The median is less sensitive to extreme values, while the trimmed mean is a compromise between the mean and the median, as it removes the highest and lowest scores before calculating the mean. In this case, both the median and trimmed mean seem to be appropriate measures of central tendency.\n\nAs for the measure of spread, the median absolute deviation (MAD) is a robust measure that is less sensitive to outliers compared to the standard deviation. Since the data set does not have extreme outliers, the MAD (3.5) is an appropriate measure of spread for this data set.\n\nIn conclusion, for this data set, the median (89.5) and the median absolute deviation (3.5) are appropriate measures of central tendency and spread, respectively."
