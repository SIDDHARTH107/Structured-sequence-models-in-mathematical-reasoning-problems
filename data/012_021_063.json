The treewidth is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and edges {(1,2), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,7)}.\n\n1. Find a tree decomposition of the graph:\n\nA possible tree decomposition for this graph is:\n\nT1 = {1, 2, 4}\nT2 = {2, 3, 4}\nT3 = {3, 4, 5}\nT4 = {4, 5}\nT5 = {5, 6, 7}\n\nWith the following tree structure:\n\nT1 - T2 - T3 - T4 - T5\n\n2. Calculate the width of the tree decomposition:\n\nThe width of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1. In this case:\n\nWidth(T1) = |{1, 2, 4}| - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\nWidth(T2) = |{2, 3, 4}| - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\nWidth(T3) = |{3, 4, 5}| - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\nWidth(T4) = |{4, 5}| - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\nWidth(T5) = |{5, 6, 7}| - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\n\n3. The treewidth is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions:\n\nIn this case, we have only one tree decomposition, and the maximum width among the bags is 2. Therefore, the treewidth of the given graph is 2."
