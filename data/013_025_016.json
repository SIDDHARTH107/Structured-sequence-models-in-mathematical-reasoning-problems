    "message_1": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, two travelers are offered a prize for submitting the lowest whole number greater than or equal to 0, but if they submit the same number they will receive a lower prize. If the maximum prize is $100, what number should the travelers choose in order to maximize their reward while avoiding submitting the same number as the other traveler?",
    "message_2": "In the Traveler's Dilemma, the travelers should choose the number 1 to maximize their reward while avoiding submitting the same number as the other traveler.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nIf both travelers choose 100, they will receive the lower prize, which is not optimal. If one traveler chooses 99, the other traveler can choose 100 and receive a prize of 99 (since it's one less than the maximum prize). However, if one traveler chooses 98, the other traveler can choose 99 and receive a prize of 98. This pattern continues all the way down to the number 1.\n\nIf one traveler chooses 1, the other traveler can choose 2 and receive a prize of 1. However, choosing 2 is not optimal because the other traveler can choose 1 and receive the maximum prize of 100. Therefore, both travelers should choose 1 to maximize their reward while avoiding submitting the same number as the other traveler."
