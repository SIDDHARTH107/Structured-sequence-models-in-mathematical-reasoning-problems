    "message_1": "A lighthouse is situated on top of a cliff that is 50 meters high. A boat is located 120 meters directly in front of the lighthouse. Find the distance between the boat and the top of the cliff, to the nearest meter, if the angle of elevation of the top of the cliff from the boat is 40 degrees.",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the tangent function in trigonometry. Let's denote the distance between the boat and the top of the cliff as x. We are given the angle of elevation (40 degrees) and the height of the cliff (50 meters).\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(40°) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(40°) = 50 meters / 120 meters\n\nNow, we can solve for x using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nx^2 = (50 meters)^2 + (120 meters)^2\nx^2 = 2500 + 14400\nx^2 = 16900\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the distance x:\n\nx = √16900\nx ≈ 130 meters\n\nSo, the distance between the boat and the top of the cliff is approximately 130 meters."
