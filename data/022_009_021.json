    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of the power series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}$, we will use the ratio test. The ratio test states that if $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = L$, then the series converges if $L < 1$, diverges if $L > 1$, and is inconclusive if $L = 1$.\n\nIn this case, our series is given by $a_n = \\frac{x^n}{n!}$. We will find the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms as $n$ goes to infinity:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}}{\\frac{x^n}{n!}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{x^{n+1}n!}{x^n(n+1)!}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{x}{n+1}\\right|$$\n\nSince the limit depends on the value of $x$, we will find the radius of convergence $R$ such that the series converges for $|x| < R$:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{x}{n+1}\\right| < 1$$\n\nAs $n$ goes to infinity, the term $\\frac{x}{n+1}$ goes to 0 for any finite value of $x$. Therefore, the limit is 0, which is less than 1. This means that the series converges for all values of $x$. Thus, the radius of convergence is $R = \\infty$.\n\nSince the series converges for all values of $x$, the interval of convergence is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$."
