    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape that is formed by iteratively removing cubes from the initial cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nFor a Menger sponge of order 3, this process is repeated three times. \n\nIn the first iteration, 1 cube is removed from the center and 6 cubes are removed from the faces, for a total of 7 cubes removed. This leaves 20 cubes, each with a volume of (1/3)^3 = 1/27.\n\nIn the second iteration, the process is repeated for each of the 20 remaining cubes. Each of these cubes will have 20 smaller cubes remaining after the second iteration. So, there will be a total of 20 * 20 = 400 cubes, each with a volume of (1/27)^3 = 1/19683.\n\nIn the third iteration, the process is repeated for each of the 400 remaining cubes. Each of these cubes will have 20 smaller cubes remaining after the third iteration. So, there will be a total of 400 * 20 = 8000 cubes, each with a volume of (1/19683)^3 = 1/7,625,597,484,987.\n\nThe total volume of a Menger sponge of order 3 is the sum of the volumes of these 8000 smallest cubes:\n\nVolume = 8000 * (1/7,625,597,484,987) â‰ˆ 0.001048096\n\nSo, the volume of a Menger sponge of order 3, if the volume of the starting cube is 1, is approximately 0.001048096."
