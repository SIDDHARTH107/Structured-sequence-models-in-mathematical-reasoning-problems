    "message_2": "Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to find the number of ways to partition a set of 5 elements into 3 non-empty subsets, so we are looking for the value of S(5, 3).\n\nUsing the formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can calculate S(5, 3) as follows:\n\n1. Calculate S(4, 2):\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)\nS(3, 2) = 2 * S(2, 2) + S(2, 1) = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3\nS(4, 2) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\n\n2. Calculate S(4, 3):\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\nS(3, 3) = 1 (since there's only one way to partition a set of 3 elements into 3 non-empty subsets: each element in its own subset)\nS(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\n\n3. Finally, calculate S(5, 3):\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25\n\nSo, there are 25 ways to partition a set of 5 elements into 3 non-empty subsets using Stirling numbers of the second kind."
