    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). \n\nFor a prime number p, φ(p) = p - 1, since all numbers less than p are relatively prime to p. \n\nFor a number n = p^k, where p is a prime number and k is a positive integer, the formula for Euler's totient function is:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p)\n\nIn this case, the number 25 can be represented as 5^2, where p = 5 and k = 2. Applying the formula:\n\nφ(25) = 25 * (1 - 1/5)\nφ(25) = 25 * (4/5)\nφ(25) = 20\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for the number 25 is 20."
