    "message_1": "A sector of a circle with a radius of 8 cm has a central angle of 45 degrees. What is the area of the sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the sector, we can use the formula:\n\nArea of sector = (Central angle / 360) * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 cm and the central angle is 45 degrees. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea of sector = (45 / 360) * π * 8^2\nArea of sector = (1/8) * π * 64\nArea of sector = 8π cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the sector is 8π square centimeters."
