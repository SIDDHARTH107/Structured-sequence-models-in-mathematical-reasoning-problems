Find the Tutte polynomial of the graph.\n\n```\n    A -- B -- C\n    |    |    |\n    D -- E    |\n         |   |\n         F -- G\n``` \n\nNote: Assume that the graph is undirected and no two edges share the same endpoints.",
    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we will use the recursive formula:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G-e; x, y) + T(G/e; x, y) if e is not a loop or a bridge,\nT(G; x, y) = x * T(G-e; x, y) if e is a loop,\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G-e; x, y) if e is a bridge.\n\nHere, G is the graph, e is an edge, G-e is the graph without the edge e, and G/e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nThe given graph G has no loops, so we don't need to consider the second case in the formula. We will start by finding the bridges in the graph. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In this case, the edges (B, C), (E, F), and (F, G) are bridges.\n\nNow, let's compute the Tutte polynomial step by step:\n\n1. Remove the bridge (B, C) and apply the formula:\nT(G; x, y) = y * T(G - (B, C); x, y)\n\n2. In G - (B, C), remove the bridge (E, F) and apply the formula:\nT(G - (B, C); x, y) = y * T(G - (B, C) - (E, F); x, y)\n\n3. In G - (B, C) - (E, F), remove the bridge (F, G) and apply the formula:\nT(G - (B, C) - (E, F); x, y) = y * T(G - (B, C) - (E, F) - (F, G); x, y)\n\nNow, the graph G - (B, C) - (E, F) - (F, G) has no more bridges and consists of three connected components: one with vertices {A, D, E}, one with vertex {B}, and one with vertices {C, F, G}. The Tutte polynomial of a connected graph with n vertices and no edges is x^(n-1). Therefore, we have:\n\nT(G - (B, C) - (E, F) - (F, G); x, y) = x^2 * x^0 * x^2 = x^4\n\nSubstituting this back into the previous equations, we get:\n\nT(G; x, y) = y * (y * (y * x^4)) = y^3 * x^4\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is T(G; x, y) = y^3 * x^4."
