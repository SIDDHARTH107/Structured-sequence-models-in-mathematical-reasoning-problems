Find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the objective function subject to the given constraints.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the graphical method to find the feasible region and then analyze the vertices of the feasible region to find the maximum value of the objective function.\n\nFirst, let's plot the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 5\n2. x - y ≤ 2\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n5. x^2 + y^2 ≤ 9\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all the constraints are satisfied. After plotting the constraints, we find that the feasible region is a pentagon with vertices A(0,0), B(0,3), C(1,2), D(2,1), and E(3,0).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the objective function f(x, y) = 4x - 3y at each of the vertices:\n\nf(A) = f(0, 0) = 4(0) - 3(0) = 0\nf(B) = f(0, 3) = 4(0) - 3(3) = -9\nf(C) = f(1, 2) = 4(1) - 3(2) = -2\nf(D) = f(2, 1) = 4(2) - 3(1) = 5\nf(E) = f(3, 0) = 4(3) - 3(0) = 12\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function is 12, which occurs at vertex E (x=3, y=0). Therefore, the optimal values of x and y are x=3 and y=0."
