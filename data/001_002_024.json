    "message_2": "To graph the line y = 2x + 3, we can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nIn this case, the slope (m) is 2 and the y-intercept (b) is 3.\n\nTo graph the line, we can start by plotting the y-intercept on the y-axis. The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, which is (0, 3).\n\nNext, we can use the slope to find another point on the line. The slope is the ratio of the change in y to the change in x (rise over run). Since the slope is 2, this means that for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units.\n\nStarting from the y-intercept (0, 3), we can move 1 unit to the right (increase x by 1) and 2 units up (increase y by 2) to find another point on the line. This point is (1, 5).\n\nNow that we have two points, (0, 3) and (1, 5), we can draw a straight line through these points to graph the equation y = 2x + 3.\n\nThe y-intercept of the line is the point where it crosses the y-axis, which is (0, 3). So, the y-intercept is 3."
