    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we will use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The order of a group G is 40, which can be factored as 40 = 2^3 * 5. Therefore, we need to consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups of G.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G. By Sylow's Theorems, we have the following constraints:\n\n1. n_2 divides 5 and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 5.\n2. n_5 divides 8 and n_5 is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can only be 1.\n\nNow, we consider the possible structures of the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 5-subgroups:\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: Since the order of a Sylow 2-subgroup is 8, it can have the structure of either Z_8 (cyclic group of order 8), Z_4 × Z_2 (direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4 and 2), or D_4 (dihedral group of order 8).\n\n2. Sylow 5-subgroups: Since the order of a Sylow 5-subgroup is 5, it can only have the structure of Z_5 (cyclic group of order 5).\n\nNow, we analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. Since both subgroups are normal, their direct product is also a group. We have the following possibilities:\n\n1. Z_8 × Z_5: This is a cyclic group of order 40.\n2. Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_5: This is a direct product of cyclic groups of orders 4, 2, and 5.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. Since the Sylow 5-subgroup is normal, we can form a semi-direct product with the Sylow 2-subgroups. We have the following possibilities:\n\n1. D_4 ⋊ Z_5: This is a semi-direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 5.\n\nThus, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 40: Z_8 × Z_5, Z_4 × Z_2 × Z_5, and D_4 ⋊ Z_5."
