    "message_2": "To show that the set of sentences {p, q, p→q} is logically consistent, we need to construct a truth table and find at least one row where all three sentences are true. Here's the truth table for p, q, and p→q:\n\n| p | q | p→q |\n|---|---|-----|\n| T | T |  T  |\n| T | F |  F  |\n| F | T |  T  |\n| F | F |  T  |\n\nNow, let's analyze the table to find a row where all three sentences are true:\n\n1. In the first row, p is true, q is true, and p→q is true. So, all three sentences are true in this row.\n2. In the second row, p→q is false, so this row doesn't satisfy all three sentences.\n3. In the third and fourth rows, p is false, so these rows don't satisfy all three sentences either.\n\nSince we found at least one row (the first row) where all three sentences are true, we can conclude that the set of sentences {p, q, p→q} is logically consistent."
