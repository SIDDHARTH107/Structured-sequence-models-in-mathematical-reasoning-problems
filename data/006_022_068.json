    "message_1": "In a school, there are 100 students who are taking a probability course. It is known that the probability of a student passing the course is 0.75. Find the probability that out of these 100 students, exactly 80 of them will pass the course.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that exactly 80 out of 100 students will pass the course, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (students passing the course)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- n is the total number of trials (students)\n- k is the number of successes (students passing)\n- p is the probability of success (0.75)\n- (1-p) is the probability of failure (0.25)\n\nIn this case, n = 100, k = 80, and p = 0.75. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(X = 80) = C(100, 80) * 0.75^80 * 0.25^20\n\nFirst, we need to calculate C(100, 80), which is the number of ways to choose 80 students out of 100:\n\nC(100, 80) = 100! / (80! * (100-80)!)\n           = 100! / (80! * 20!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 80) = (100! / (80! * 20!)) * 0.75^80 * 0.25^20\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 80) â‰ˆ 0.0439\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 80 out of 100 students will pass the course is approximately 4.39%."
