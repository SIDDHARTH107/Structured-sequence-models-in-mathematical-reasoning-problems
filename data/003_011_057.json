    "message_1": "A plane is flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet and spots a building that is at an angle 30° from its position. What is the distance between the plane and the building? (Assume the plane is flying directly above the building)",
    "message_2": "We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent function relates the angle of a right triangle to the ratio of the opposite side (the altitude of the plane) and the adjacent side (the horizontal distance between the plane and the building). In this case, we have:\n\ntan(angle) = opposite/adjacent\n\nWe are given the angle (30°) and the opposite side (10,000 feet). We want to find the adjacent side (the horizontal distance between the plane and the building). Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\nadjacent = opposite/tan(angle)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nadjacent = 10,000 feet / tan(30°)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n30° * (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can find the tangent of the angle:\n\ntan(π/6) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can find the adjacent side:\n\nadjacent ≈ 10,000 feet / 0.577 ≈ 17,328 feet\n\nNow that we have the adjacent side, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the plane and the building (the hypotenuse of the right triangle):\n\ndistance² = opposite² + adjacent²\ndistance² = (10,000 feet)² + (17,328 feet)²\ndistance² = 100,000,000 + 300,000,384\ndistance² = 400,000,384\n\nNow, we can find the distance by taking the square root:\n\ndistance ≈ √400,000,384 ≈ 20,000 feet\n\nSo, the distance between the plane and the building is approximately 20,000 feet."
