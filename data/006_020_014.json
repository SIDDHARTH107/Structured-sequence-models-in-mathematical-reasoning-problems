    "message_1": "In a small town, there are 30 families. Each family has 2 children. If the probability of a family having at least one boy is 3/4, what is the probability that there are exactly 20 families with at least one boy?",
    "message_2": "Let's first find the probability of a family having no boys, i.e., having two girls. Since the probability of having at least one boy is 3/4, the probability of having no boys (two girls) is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that there are exactly 20 families with at least one boy among the 30 families. This is a binomial probability problem, where we have 30 trials (families), the probability of success (having at least one boy) is 3/4, and we want to find the probability of having exactly 20 successes.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes in n trials, C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nIn our case, n = 30, k = 20, and p = 3/4. So, we have:\n\nP(X = 20) = C(30, 20) * (3/4)^20 * (1/4)^(30-20)\n\nFirst, let's find C(30, 20), which is the number of ways to choose 20 families out of 30:\n\nC(30, 20) = 30! / (20! * 10!) = 30045015\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 20) = 30045015 * (3/4)^20 * (1/4)^10 â‰ˆ 0.0014\n\nSo, the probability that there are exactly 20 families with at least one boy is approximately 0.0014, or 0.14%."
