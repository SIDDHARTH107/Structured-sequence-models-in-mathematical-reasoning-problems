    "message_1": "In a Dictator Game, Player A is given $100 to divide among themselves and Player B. Player A decides to give Player B x amount of money, where x is between 0 and 100. If Player B receives less than 30 dollars, they will reject the offer and both players will receive nothing. What is the optimal amount of money that Player A should give to Player B to maximize their own payoff?",
    "message_2": "To maximize their own payoff, Player A should give Player B exactly $30. This is because if Player A gives any less than $30, Player B will reject the offer and both players will receive nothing. By giving $30, Player A ensures that Player B will accept the offer and Player A will keep the remaining $70. This is the maximum amount Player A can keep while still having the offer accepted by Player B."
