    "message_1": "Consider a group G of order 32. Let H be a subgroup of G such that |H| = 8. How many distinct subgroup of G of order 8 are there, up to isomorphism?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct subgroups of G of order 8 up to isomorphism, we first need to consider the possible structures of a group of order 32. Since 32 = 2^5, G must be a p-group with p = 2. There are two possible isomorphism classes for groups of order 32: the cyclic group Z_32 and the direct product of Z_2 and Z_16.\n\nCase 1: G is isomorphic to Z_32.\nIn this case, there is only one subgroup of order 8, which is generated by the element of order 8. So, there is only 1 distinct subgroup of order 8 up to isomorphism in this case.\n\nCase 2: G is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_16.\nIn this case, we have the following possibilities for subgroups of order 8:\n- A subgroup isomorphic to Z_8, which can be generated by an element of order 8 in Z_16. There are 7 such elements in Z_16, but since they all generate the same subgroup, there is only 1 distinct subgroup of this type.\n- A subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_4, which can be generated by an element of order 2 in Z_2 and an element of order 4 in Z_16. There are 3 such elements in Z_16, but since they all generate the same subgroup, there is only 1 distinct subgroup of this type.\n- A subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2, which can be generated by three elements of order 2 in Z_2 and Z_16. There are 15 such elements in Z_16, but we need to divide by the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of 15, which is C(15,3) = 455. So, there are 455 distinct subgroups of this type.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 455 = 457 distinct subgroups of order 8 up to isomorphism in the case where G is isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_16.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of distinct subgroups of G of order 8 up to isomorphism, which means we should only count each isomorphism class once. Since there are three isomorphism classes of groups of order 8 (Z_8, Z_2 × Z_4, and Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2), the answer is 3 distinct subgroups of order 8 up to isomorphism."
