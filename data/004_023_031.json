    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 4 - x^2, we first need to find the points of intersection of the two curves. We do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 = 4 - x^2\n\n2x^2 = 4\nx^2 = 2\nx = ±√2\n\nNow, we will integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval [-√2, √2]:\n\nArea = ∫[-√2, √2] (4 - x^2 - x^2) dx\nArea = ∫[-√2, √2] (4 - 2x^2) dx\n\nNow, we integrate:\n\nArea = [4x - (2/3)x^3] (from -√2 to √2)\n\nNow, we plug in the limits of integration:\n\nArea = (4√2 - (2/3)(√2)^3) - (4(-√2) - (2/3)(-√2)^3)\nArea = (4√2 - (8/3)(2)) - (-4√2 - (8/3)(-2))\nArea = (4√2 - 16/3) - (-4√2 + 16/3)\nArea = 8√2\n\nSo, the area enclosed between the curves y = x^2 and y = 4 - x^2 is 8√2 square units."
