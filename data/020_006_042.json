    "message_1": "A company produces two products: Product A and Product B. Product A requires 3 hours to produce and sells for $12 per unit, while Product B requires 5 hours to produce and sells for $20 per unit. The company has 60 hours of production time available per week. However, due to limited resources, the company can only produce a maximum of 10 units of Product A and 8 units of Product B. The company wants to maximize its profit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe objective function (profit) is given by:\nP(x, y) = 12x + 20y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n3x + 5y ≤ 60 (production time constraint)\nx ≤ 10 (maximum units of Product A)\ny ≤ 8 (maximum units of Product B)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 5y ≤ 60\ny ≤ (60 - 3x)/5\n\n2. x ≤ 10\n\n3. y ≤ 8\n\n4. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 8), (10, 0), (10, 6), and (6, 7.2).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 12(0) + 20(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 8) = 12(0) + 20(8) = $160\n3. P(10, 0) = 12(10) + 20(0) = $120\n4. P(10, 6) = 12(10) + 20(6) = $240\n5. P(6, 7.2) = 12(6) + 20(7.2) = $216\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point (10, 6), with a profit of $240. Therefore, the company should produce 10 units of Product A and 6 units of Product B to maximize its profit."
