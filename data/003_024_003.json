    "message_1": "A student is pulling a sled with a force of 50 N at an angle of 30 degrees above the horizontal. If the sled weighs 100 N, what is the projection of the force onto the horizontal direction? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "message_2": "To find the projection of the force onto the horizontal direction, we can use the following formula:\n\nHorizontal projection = Force × cos(angle)\n\nIn this case, the force is 50 N and the angle is 30 degrees. First, we need to convert the angle to radians:\n\n30 degrees × (π/180) = π/6 radians\n\nNow, we can find the horizontal projection:\n\nHorizontal projection = 50 N × cos(π/6)\nHorizontal projection ≈ 50 N × 0.866\nHorizontal projection ≈ 43.3 N\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the horizontal projection of the force is 43 N."
