    "message_2": "To find the time t at which the car reaches a velocity of zero, we need to find when v(t) = 0. \n\nv(t) = t^2 - 4t + 7\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points of the function by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero.\n\nv'(t) = 2t - 4\n\nNow, set v'(t) = 0 and solve for t:\n\n0 = 2t - 4\n2t = 4\nt = 2\n\nNow, we need to check if this value of t actually gives us a velocity of zero. Plug t = 2 back into the original velocity function:\n\nv(2) = (2)^2 - 4(2) + 7\nv(2) = 4 - 8 + 7\nv(2) = 3\n\nSince v(2) â‰  0, the car does not reach a velocity of zero at t = 2. The mean value theorem does not guarantee a solution in this case, as the function is not continuous over an interval [a, b] where v(a) and v(b) have different signs. Therefore, we cannot find a time t at which the car reaches a velocity of zero using the mean value theorem."
