    "message_1": "What is the initial angle required for both the upper and lower pendulums of a double pendulum, given that the length of the upper pendulum is 1 meter, the length of the lower pendulum is 2 meters, and the masses of both pendulums are equal, in order for the system to exhibit chaotic behavior?",
    "message_2": "The behavior of a double pendulum is highly sensitive to initial conditions, and predicting the exact angle required for chaotic behavior is not possible due to the complexity of the system. However, it is known that when the initial angles of the pendulums are large, the system is more likely to exhibit chaotic behavior.\n\nIn general, starting with initial angles greater than 90 degrees (Ï€/2 radians) for both the upper and lower pendulums increases the likelihood of chaotic behavior. However, there is no specific angle that guarantees chaos, as the system's behavior depends on various factors such as friction, air resistance, and other external forces."
