    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n[ 2  1 | 7 ]\n[ 4  2 | 14]\n\nNow, we perform Gaussian elimination to row reduce the matrix to its row echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1 in the first row:\n\n[ 1  0.5 | 3.5 ]\n[ 4  2   | 14 ]\n\nStep 2: Replace the second row with the second row minus 4 times the first row to eliminate the leading 4 in the second row:\n\n[ 1  0.5 | 3.5 ]\n[ 0  0   | 0   ]\n\nThe row reduced matrix is:\n\n[ 1  0.5 | 3.5 ]\n[ 0  0   | 0   ]\n\nSince we have a row of all zeros in the matrix, we can see that the two equations are linearly dependent, meaning they represent the same line. Therefore, the system has infinitely many solutions."
