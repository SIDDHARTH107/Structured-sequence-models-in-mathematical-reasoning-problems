    "message_2": "To find the minimum size of a vertex cover, we can use the fact that the size of a minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of a maximum matching. This is known as König's theorem. A matching is a set of edges in the graph such that no two edges share a vertex. A maximum matching is a matching with the largest possible number of edges.\n\nLet's first find the maximum matching for the given graph. Since we don't have the specific graph, we can only find the upper bound for the maximum matching. In a graph with 7 vertices and 9 edges, the maximum matching can have at most 3 edges, as each edge in the matching covers 2 vertices, and there are only 7 vertices in total.\n\nNow, according to König's theorem, the minimum size of a vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching, which is 3 in this case. Therefore, the minimum size of a vertex cover for the given graph is 3.\n\nTo list all possible vertex covers with that size, we need the specific graph. However, since we don't have the graph, we can't list all the possible vertex covers. If you provide the specific graph, we can find and list all the possible vertex covers with the minimum size."
