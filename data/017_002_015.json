    "message_2": "By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup H of G must divide the order of G. Since the order of G is 12, the possible orders of H are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We will now find the generators of H for each possible order.\n\n1. Order 1: The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup {e}, where e is the identity element.\n\n2. Order 2: The subgroups of order 2 must be generated by an element of order 2. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/2) has order 2, where n is the order of the group. In this case, g^(12/2) = g^6 has order 2. So, H = <g^6> = {e, g^6}.\n\n3. Order 3: The subgroups of order 3 must be generated by an element of order 3. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/3) has order 3, where n is the order of the group. In this case, g^(12/3) = g^4 has order 3. So, H = <g^4> = {e, g^4, g^8}.\n\n4. Order 4: The subgroups of order 4 must be generated by an element of order 4. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/4) has order 4, where n is the order of the group. In this case, g^(12/4) = g^3 has order 4. So, H = <g^3> = {e, g^3, g^6, g^9}.\n\n5. Order 6: The subgroups of order 6 must be generated by an element of order 6. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/6) has order 6, where n is the order of the group. In this case, g^(12/6) = g^2 has order 6. So, H = <g^2> = {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10}.\n\n6. Order 12: The only subgroup of order 12 is G itself, generated by g.\n\nIn summary, the possible orders of H are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, with the corresponding generators being e, g^6, g^4, g^3, g^2, and g, respectively."
