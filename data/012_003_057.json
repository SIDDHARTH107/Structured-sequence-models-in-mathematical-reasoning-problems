    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them). The maximum independent set is the largest such set.\n\nTo find the size of the maximum independent set in this graph, we can use the fact that the sum of the sizes of a maximum independent set and a minimum vertex cover is equal to the number of vertices in the graph. This is known as the Gallai's theorem.\n\nA vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest such set.\n\nSince we have a graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges, the average degree of the vertices is (2 * 7) / 6 â‰ˆ 2.33. In a graph with such a low average degree, it is likely that the minimum vertex cover will be small.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario for the minimum vertex cover. The worst case would be a star graph, where one central vertex is connected to all other vertices. In this case, the minimum vertex cover would have size 1 (just the central vertex), and the maximum independent set would have size 5 (all the other vertices).\n\nHowever, since our graph has 7 edges, it cannot be a star graph (a star graph with 6 vertices has only 5 edges). This means that there must be at least one additional edge between the non-central vertices. In this case, the minimum vertex cover would have size at least 2 (the central vertex and one of the non-central vertices connected by the additional edge). Therefore, the maximum independent set would have size at most 4 (6 - 2).\n\nSo, the size of the maximum independent set in this graph is at most 4."
