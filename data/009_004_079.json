    "message_2": "To determine the equation of motion and the period of oscillation for the simple harmonic oscillator, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the angular frequency (ω) using the formula: ω = √(k/m), where k is the spring stiffness and m is the mass.\n\nω = √(20 N/m / 2 kg) = √(10 s^(-2)) = √10 rad/s\n\n2. Calculate the period of oscillation (T) using the formula: T = 2π/ω\n\nT = 2π/√10 ≈ 1.99 s\n\n3. Determine the amplitude (A) and phase angle (φ) using the initial displacement (x0) and initial velocity (v0). We can use the following equations:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\nv(t) = -A * ω * sin(ωt + φ)\n\nAt t = 0, we have:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ) = 0.3 m\nv(0) = -A * ω * sin(φ) = 0.5 m/s\n\nNow, we can solve for A and φ:\n\nA = √(x(0)^2 + (v(0)/ω)^2) = √(0.3^2 + (0.5/√10)^2) ≈ 0.316 m\n\ntan(φ) = -v(0) / (ω * x(0)) = -0.5 / (√10 * 0.3)\nφ ≈ -0.169 rad\n\n4. Write the equation of motion using the calculated values:\n\nx(t) = 0.316 * cos(√10 * t - 0.169)\n\nSo, the equation of motion is x(t) = 0.316 * cos(√10 * t - 0.169) and the period of oscillation is approximately 1.99 seconds."
