    "message_2": "To prove this statement, we will use modal logic and the concept of possible worlds. In modal logic, we consider different possible worlds and the truth values of statements in those worlds. We will show that there exists a possible world where the given statement is true.\n\nLet's consider the set S of all integers greater than or equal to 1. Now, let's choose a number n from this set. We will show that there exists a possible world where the statement \"for all m in S, m is either equal to n or is not divisible by n\" is true.\n\nPossible World 1: n = 1\nIn this possible world, we choose n to be 1. Now, let's consider any integer m in the set S. Since every integer is divisible by 1, the only condition that can be true for all m in S is that m is equal to n. In this case, the statement is true for n = 1.\n\nPossible World 2: n > 1\nIn this possible world, we choose n to be any integer greater than 1. Now, let's consider any integer m in the set S. If m is equal to n, then the statement is true for that m. If m is not equal to n, then there are two possibilities: either m is divisible by n or m is not divisible by n. Since n > 1, there will always be integers in S that are not divisible by n (e.g., prime numbers greater than n or any number that shares no common factors with n). Therefore, in this possible world, the statement is also true for n > 1.\n\nSince we have shown that there exists a possible world where the statement is true for both n = 1 and n > 1, we can conclude that there exists a number n in S such that for all m in S, m is either equal to n or is not divisible by n."
