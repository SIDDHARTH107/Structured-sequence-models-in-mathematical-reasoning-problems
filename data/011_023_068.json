    "message_1": "A graph has 7 vertices, and each vertex can be colored using one of three different colors. How many ways are there to color the vertices such that adjacent vertices have different colors?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the chromatic polynomial. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of a graph G is a polynomial that counts the number of proper k-colorings of G (i.e., colorings of the vertices of G such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color). However, since the problem does not provide any information about the edges or the structure of the graph, we cannot determine the chromatic polynomial for this specific graph.\n\nIn general, for a graph with n vertices and k colors, the number of ways to color the vertices such that adjacent vertices have different colors can be found using the chromatic polynomial. But without more information about the graph's structure, we cannot provide a specific answer to this problem."
