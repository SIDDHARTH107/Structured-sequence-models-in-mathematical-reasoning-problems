    "message_2": "To find the degree of the Fano variety given by the intersection of the two hypersurfaces, we first need to find the degrees of the individual hypersurfaces.\n\nFor the first hypersurface, $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + w^3 = 0$, the degree is the maximum total degree of the monomials, which is 3.\n\nFor the second hypersurface, $xy^2 + x^2z + yz^2 - 3wxyz = 0$, the degree is also the maximum total degree of the monomials, which is 3.\n\nNow, to find the degree of the intersection of these two hypersurfaces, we can use the Bézout's theorem. Bézout's theorem states that the degree of the intersection of two hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{P}^3$ is the product of their degrees, assuming that the intersection is transversal and the hypersurfaces are in general position.\n\nIn our case, the degrees of the two hypersurfaces are both 3, so the degree of the intersection (the Fano variety) is $3 \\times 3 = 9$."
