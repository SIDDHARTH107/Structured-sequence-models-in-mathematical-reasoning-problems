What is the smallest number of people needed at the party to satisfy this condition?",
    "message_2": "Using Ramsey theory, we can determine the smallest number of people needed at a party to satisfy the given condition by finding the Ramsey number R(3,3). The Ramsey number R(m,n) is the smallest integer such that in any group of R(m,n) people, there will always be either m mutual friends or n mutual strangers.\n\nIn this case, we want to find R(3,3). The smallest number of people needed at the party to guarantee either three mutual friends or three mutual strangers is 6. This is because, with 6 people, if each person has at least 3 friends, then there must be a group of 3 mutual friends. If not, then there must be a group of 3 mutual strangers."
