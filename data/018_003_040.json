    "message_2": "The union of two sets A and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. \n\nSo, the union of sets A and B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, we need to show that the resulting set (A ∪ B) is a superset of both sets A and B.\n\nA set C is a superset of a set D if every element of D is also an element of C.\n\nLet's check if A ∪ B is a superset of A:\n\n1 ∈ A ∪ B, 3 ∈ A ∪ B, 5 ∈ A ∪ B, and 7 ∈ A ∪ B. Since all elements of A are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNow, let's check if A ∪ B is a superset of B:\n\n2 ∈ A ∪ B, 4 ∈ A ∪ B, 6 ∈ A ∪ B, and 8 ∈ A ∪ B. Since all elements of B are in A ∪ B, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, the resulting set A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} is a superset of both sets A and B."
