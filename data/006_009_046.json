    "message_1": "In a population of 10,000 individuals, it is known that 5% have a specific medical condition. What is the probability that a random selection of 100 individuals will have at least 7 individuals with the medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, individuals with the medical condition) in n trials (in this case, the random selection of 100 individuals)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of an individual having the medical condition, which is 5% or 0.05)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100 individuals)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 7 individuals with the medical condition)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having at least 7 individuals with the medical condition, we need to find the sum of the probabilities for k = 7, 8, 9, ..., 100.\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + ... + P(X = 100)\n\nHowever, it's easier to find the probability of the complement (having 6 or fewer individuals with the medical condition) and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = 1 - P(X ≤ 6) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 6))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 6 using the binomial probability formula and sum them up:\n\nP(X ≤ 6) = Σ [C(100, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(100-k)] for k = 0 to 6\n\nCalculating the probabilities for each k:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * (0.05)^0 * (0.95)^100 ≈ 0.0000\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * (0.05)^1 * (0.95)^99 ≈ 0.0001\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * (0.05)^2 * (0.95)^98 ≈ 0.0015\nP(X = 3) = C(100, 3) * (0.05)^3 * (0.95)^97 ≈ 0.0081\nP(X = 4) = C(100, 4) * (0.05)^4 * (0.95)^96 ≈ 0.0270\nP(X = 5) = C(100, 5) * (0.05)^5 * (0.95)^95 ≈ 0.0611\nP(X = 6) = C(100, 6) * (0.05)^6 * (0.95)^94 ≈ 0.1034\n\nSumming up the probabilities:\n\nP(X ≤ 6) ≈ 0.0000 + 0.0001 + 0.0015 + 0.0081 + 0.0270 + 0.0611 + 0.1034 ≈ 0.2012\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least 7 individuals with the medical condition:\n\nP(X ≥ 7) = 1 - P(X ≤ 6) ≈ 1 - 0.2012 ≈ 0.7988\n\nSo, the probability that a random selection of 100 individuals will have at least 7 individuals with the medical condition is approximately 79.88%."
