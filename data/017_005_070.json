    "message_2": "To find all possible groups of order 125, we can use the fact that 125 = 5^3. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. In this case, we have three possibilities:\n\n1. G is a cyclic group of order 125.\n2. G is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a cyclic group of order 25.\n3. G is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nNow, let's classify each group:\n\n1. Cyclic group of order 125: This group is cyclic, as it has only one generator that generates the entire group.\n\n2. Direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a cyclic group of order 25: This group is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25. The group of order 25 is cyclic, as it has only one generator that generates the entire group.\n\n3. Direct product of three cyclic groups of order 5: This group is not cyclic, as it has more than one generator. However, it is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25. The group of order 25 in this case is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn summary, we have three possible groups of order 125:\n\n1. A cyclic group of order 125 (cyclic).\n2. A group isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a cyclic group of order 25 (asomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25).\n3. A group isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 5 (asomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 5 and a group of order 25)."
