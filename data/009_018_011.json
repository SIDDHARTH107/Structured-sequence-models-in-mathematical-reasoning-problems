    "message_2": "To solve this non-linear differential equation, we can use a substitution method. Let's define a new function v(t) such that:\n\nv(t) = y'(t)\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\nv'(t) + v(t) + y(t)^2 = 0\n\nNow, we have a first-order non-linear differential equation. We can rewrite it as:\n\nv'(t) = -v(t) - y(t)^2\n\nNow, we can use the integrating factor method to solve this first-order ODE. The integrating factor is given by:\n\nIF(t) = e^(∫-dt) = e^(-t)\n\nMultiply the equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(-t)v'(t) - e^(-t)v(t) = -e^(-t)y(t)^2\n\nNow, the left-hand side of the equation is the derivative of the product of v(t) and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dt (v(t)e^(-t)) = -e^(-t)y(t)^2\n\nIntegrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n∫d(v(t)e^(-t)) = ∫-e^(-t)y(t)^2 dt\n\nv(t)e^(-t) = ∫-e^(-t)y(t)^2 dt + C₁\n\nNow, we can solve for v(t):\n\nv(t) = e^(t)∫-e^(-t)y(t)^2 dt + C₁e^(t)\n\nWe know that v(0) = y'(0) = -2, so we can find C₁:\n\n-2 = e^(0)∫-e^(0)y(0)^2 dt + C₁e^(0)\n-2 = C₁\n\nNow we have:\n\nv(t) = e^(t)∫-e^(-t)y(t)^2 dt - 2e^(t)\n\nNow, we can find y(t) by integrating v(t):\n\ny(t) = ∫(e^(t)∫-e^(-t)y(t)^2 dt - 2e^(t)) dt\n\nUnfortunately, this integral does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, we can still use the initial condition y(0) = 1 to find a particular solution using numerical methods or power series approximations."
