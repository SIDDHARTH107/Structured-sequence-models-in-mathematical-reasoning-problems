    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of length 7 and 10, and the included angle between them is 60°. What is the area of the triangle, using trigonometry?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two sides, and C is the included angle between them.\n\nIn this case, a = 7, b = 10, and C = 60°.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\nC (in radians) = (60 * π) / 180 = π / 3\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 7 * 10 * sin(π / 3)\n\nThe sine of π / 3 is equal to √3 / 2:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 7 * 10 * (√3 / 2)\n\nArea = 35 * (√3 / 2)\n\nArea ≈ 30.31 square units\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 30.31 square units."
