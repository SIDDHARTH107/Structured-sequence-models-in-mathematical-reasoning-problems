    "message_2": "Proof:\n\nTo show that the empty set ∅ is a subset of set A, we need to prove that every element in the empty set is also an element of set A. By definition, the empty set has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A.\n\nSince there are no elements in the empty set that are not in set A, it follows that every element in the empty set is also an element of set A. Thus, the empty set ∅ is a subset of set A. QED."
