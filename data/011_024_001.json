Each warehouse has a different capacity for supplying goods and each store has a different demand for goods. The following matrix shows the capacity (in tons) of each warehouse and the demand (in tons) of each store:\n\n| Warehouse | Capacity (in tons) |\n|-----------|--------------------|\n| 1         | 30                 |\n| 2         | 25                 |\n| 3         | 35                 |\n| 4         | 20                 |\n| 5         | 25                 |\n\n| Store | Demand (in tons) |\n|-------|------------------|\n| A     | 20               |\n| B     | 15               |\n| C     | 25               |\n| D     | 20               |\n| E     | 15               |\n| F     | 10               |\n| G     | 25               |\n| H     | 5                |\n\nAssuming that the transportation cost per ton of goods from each warehouse to each store is the same, what is the minimum transportation cost to fulfill the demand of all the stores? (Hint: This is a network flow problem and can be solved using the minimum cost maximum flow algorithm.)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first create a bipartite graph with warehouses on one side and stores on the other side. The capacities of the warehouses and the demands of the stores will be the weights of the edges connecting the source and sink nodes to the warehouses and stores, respectively. The transportation cost per ton of goods from each warehouse to each store is the same, so we will assign a cost of 1 to each edge connecting a warehouse to a store.\n\nThe graph will look like this:\n\nSource -> 30 -> Warehouse 1 -> 1 -> Store A -> 20 -> Sink\n       -> 25 -> Warehouse 2 -> 1 -> Store B -> 15 -> Sink\n       -> 35 -> Warehouse 3 -> 1 -> Store C -> 25 -> Sink\n       -> 20 -> Warehouse 4 -> 1 -> Store D -> 20 -> Sink\n       -> 25 -> Warehouse 5 -> 1 -> Store E -> 15 -> Sink\n                                 -> Store F -> 10 -> Sink\n                                 -> Store G -> 25 -> Sink\n                                 -> Store H -> 5  -> Sink\n\nNow, we will apply the minimum cost maximum flow algorithm to find the minimum transportation cost to fulfill the demand of all the stores.\n\nAfter applying the algorithm, we get the following flow distribution:\n\nWarehouse 1: Store A (20), Store B (10)\nWarehouse 2: Store B (5), Store E (15), Store H (5)\nWarehouse 3: Store C (25), Store D (10)\nWarehouse 4: Store D (10), Store F (10)\nWarehouse 5: Store G (25)\n\nThe total flow (in tons) is equal to the sum of the demands of all the stores, which is 20 + 15 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 25 + 5 = 135 tons.\n\nSince the transportation cost per ton of goods from each warehouse to each store is the same and equal to 1, the minimum transportation cost to fulfill the demand of all the stores is 135 * 1 = 135."
