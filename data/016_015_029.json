    "message_2": "The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve, and its total length increases with each order. For each increase in order, the number of line segments in the curve is multiplied by 4. \n\nFor a Hilbert curve of order 1, there are 4 line segments. To find the total length of the curve for order 5, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal length = 4^(order)\n\nSo for order 5, the total length would be:\n\nTotal length = 4^5 = 1024\n\nTherefore, the total length of the Hilbert curve of order 5, with each individual line segment having a length of 1 unit, is 1024 units."
