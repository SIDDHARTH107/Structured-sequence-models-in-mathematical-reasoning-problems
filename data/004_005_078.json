    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation y' + 3y = 6x, we first find the integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of y, which is 3 in this case. \n\nIntegrating factor = e^(∫3 dx) = e^(3x)\n\nNow, we multiply the entire differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(3x)(y' + 3y) = 6x * e^(3x)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(e^(3x)y)' = 6x * e^(3x)\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(e^(3x)y)' dx = ∫6x * e^(3x) dx\n\nTo integrate the right side, we use integration by parts, where u = x and dv = 6e^(3x) dx. Then, du = dx and v = 2e^(3x). Applying integration by parts:\n\n∫6x * e^(3x) dx = 2xe^(3x) - ∫2e^(3x) dx\n\nNow, we integrate the remaining term:\n\n2xe^(3x) - ∫2e^(3x) dx = 2xe^(3x) - (2/3)e^(3x) + C\n\nSo, we have:\n\ne^(3x)y = 2xe^(3x) - (2/3)e^(3x) + C\n\nNow, we divide by e^(3x) to isolate y:\n\ny = 2x - (2/3) + C * e^(-3x)\n\nTo find the constant C, we use the initial condition y(0) = 2:\n\n2 = 2(0) - (2/3) + C * e^(-3*0)\n2 = - (2/3) + C\n\nThus, C = 8/3. The final solution is:\n\ny(x) = 2x - (2/3) + (8/3)e^(-3x)"
