    "message_2": "The separation axiom class refers to the topological properties of a space. In the context of the Euclidean plane, we can consider the separation axioms T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4. Let's analyze each of them:\n\n1. T0 (Kolmogorov) - For any two distinct points, there exists an open set containing one of the points but not the other. In the Euclidean plane, we can always find open balls around A and B that do not intersect, so the points A and B satisfy the T0 axiom.\n\n2. T1 (Frechet) - For any two distinct points, there exist open sets containing each point such that the open sets do not intersect. Again, in the Euclidean plane, we can find open balls around A and B that do not intersect, so the points A and B satisfy the T1 axiom.\n\n3. T2 (Hausdorff) - For any two distinct points, there exist disjoint open sets containing each point. In the Euclidean plane, we can find open balls around A and B that do not intersect, so the points A and B satisfy the T2 axiom.\n\n4. T3 (Regular) - For any closed set and a point not in the set, there exist disjoint open sets containing the closed set and the point. In the Euclidean plane, we can find open balls around A and B that do not intersect, so the points A and B satisfy the T3 axiom.\n\n5. T4 (Normal) - For any two disjoint closed sets, there exist disjoint open sets containing each closed set. In the Euclidean plane, we can find open balls around A and B that do not intersect, so the points A and B satisfy the T4 axiom.\n\nThus, the points A(3,4) and B(5,6) in the Euclidean plane belong to all the separation axiom classes T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4."
