Suppose that the intersection of Y with any other subvariety of X is transverse. Compute the first cohomology group with coefficients in Q of the intersection cohomology complex of Y.",
    "message_2": "To compute the first cohomology group with coefficients in Q of the intersection cohomology complex of Y, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The intersection cohomology of a smooth variety is isomorphic to its singular cohomology.\n2. The intersection cohomology of a subvariety Y of a smooth variety X is given by the relative cohomology of the pair (X, X - Y).\n3. The cohomology of a smooth variety of dimension n is concentrated in degrees 0, 2, ..., 2n.\n\nSince Y is a subvariety of X defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2, it is a hypersurface of degree 2 in X. Let's denote the complement of Y in X by U, i.e., U = X - Y. We are interested in computing the first cohomology group of the intersection cohomology complex of Y, which is given by the relative cohomology group H^1(X, U; Q).\n\nBy the long exact sequence of the pair (X, U) in cohomology, we have:\n\n... → H^0(X, Q) → H^0(U, Q) → H^1(X, U; Q) → H^1(X, Q) → H^1(U, Q) → ...\n\nSince X is a smooth variety of dimension 3, its cohomology is concentrated in degrees 0, 2, 4, and 6. In particular, H^1(X, Q) = 0. Therefore, the long exact sequence becomes:\n\n... → H^0(X, Q) → H^0(U, Q) → H^1(X, U; Q) → 0 → H^1(U, Q) → ...\n\nNow, H^0(X, Q) is the constant sheaf Q on X, and H^0(U, Q) is the constant sheaf Q on U. Since U is an open subset of X, the restriction map H^0(X, Q) → H^0(U, Q) is an isomorphism. This implies that H^1(X, U; Q) = 0.\n\nThus, the first cohomology group with coefficients in Q of the intersection cohomology complex of Y is trivial, i.e., H^1(Y, Q) = 0."
