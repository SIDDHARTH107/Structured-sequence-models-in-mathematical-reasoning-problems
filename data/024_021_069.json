    "message_2": "To find the Killing vector fields, we need to solve the Killing equation for the given metric. The Killing equation is given by:\n\n$\\nabla_\\mu \\xi_\\nu + \\nabla_\\nu \\xi_\\mu = 0$\n\nwhere $\\xi$ is the Killing vector field and $\\nabla$ is the covariant derivative. In polar coordinates, the non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n\n$\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = -r$\n$\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n\nNow, we can write down the Killing equation in polar coordinates:\n\n1. For $\\mu = \\nu = r$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial \\xi_r}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r} \\xi_r = 0$\n\n2. For $\\mu = \\nu = \\theta$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial \\xi_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{1}{r} \\xi_\\theta = 0$\n\n3. For $\\mu = r$, $\\nu = \\theta$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial \\xi_r}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial \\xi_\\theta}{\\partial r} - \\frac{1}{r} \\xi_\\theta = 0$\n\nNow, we can solve these equations to find the Killing vector fields:\n\n1. The first equation can be solved by separation of variables, yielding:\n\n$\\xi_r = f(\\theta)$\n\n2. Similarly, the second equation can be solved by separation of variables, yielding:\n\n$\\xi_\\theta = g(r)$\n\n3. Substituting $\\xi_r$ and $\\xi_\\theta$ into the third equation, we get:\n\n$f'(\\theta) + g'(r) - \\frac{1}{r} g(r) = 0$\n\nNow, we can find three linearly independent solutions for the Killing vector fields:\n\na) $\\xi_r = 1$, $\\xi_\\theta = 0$:\n\nThis corresponds to the Killing vector field $\\xi^{(1)} = \\partial_r$.\n\nb) $\\xi_r = 0$, $\\xi_\\theta = r$:\n\nThis corresponds to the Killing vector field $\\xi^{(2)} = r \\partial_\\theta$.\n\nc) $\\xi_r = -\\theta$, $\\xi_\\theta = 0$:\n\nThis corresponds to the Killing vector field $\\xi^{(3)} = -\\theta \\partial_r$.\n\nSo, the three linearly independent Killing vector fields for the given metric are:\n\n$\\xi^{(1)} = \\partial_r$\n$\\xi^{(2)} = r \\partial_\\theta$\n$\\xi^{(3)} = -\\theta \\partial_r$"
