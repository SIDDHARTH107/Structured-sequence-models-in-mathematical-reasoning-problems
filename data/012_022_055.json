    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a clique of size m (a complete subgraph with m vertices) or an independent set of size n (a set of n vertices with no edges between them).\n\nR(3,5) is the smallest integer R such that any graph with R vertices will contain either a clique of size 3 or an independent set of size 5.\n\nThe exact value of R(3,5) is not known, but it is known that 14 ≤ R(3,5) ≤ 43. The lower bound of 14 was proven by Brendan McKay in 1990, and the upper bound of 43 was proven by Paul Erdős and Joel Spencer in 1973. Despite significant efforts, the exact value of R(3,5) remains an open problem in mathematics."
