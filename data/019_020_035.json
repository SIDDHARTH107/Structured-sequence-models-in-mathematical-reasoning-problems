    "message_2": "To find the maximum value among n unsorted integers using traditional comparison-based sorting algorithms, you would need to perform (n-1) comparisons. This is because you can compare the first two numbers, then compare the larger of those two with the next number, and so on, until you reach the end of the list. In each comparison, you are eliminating one number as a potential maximum, so after (n-1) comparisons, you will have found the maximum value."
