    "message_1": "In a local market, there are 50 customers who would buy product A and 100 customers who would buy product B. If a customer is chosen randomly, what is the probability that the customer would buy product A?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen customer would buy product A, we need to divide the number of customers who would buy product A by the total number of customers.\n\nTotal number of customers = Customers who would buy product A + Customers who would buy product B\nTotal number of customers = 50 + 100 = 150\n\nProbability of a customer buying product A = (Number of customers who would buy product A) / (Total number of customers)\nProbability of a customer buying product A = 50 / 150 = 1/3 or approximately 0.3333\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen customer would buy product A is 1/3 or approximately 0.3333."
