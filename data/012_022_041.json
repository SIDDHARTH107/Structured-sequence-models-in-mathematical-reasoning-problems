    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(4,4) is 18. This means that in a graph with 18 vertices, either a set of 4 vertices will form a complete graph of order 4 (a clique of 4 vertices, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex), or its complement will contain a complete graph of order 4 (a set of 4 vertices where no two vertices are connected)."
