    "message_2": "To find the dimensions of the can with the smallest surface area, we will use the formula for the volume of a cylinder and the formula for the surface area of a cylinder. Let r be the radius of the base of the cylinder and h be the height of the cylinder.\n\nVolume (V) = πr^2h\nSurface Area (A) = 2πrh + 2πr^2\n\nWe are given that the volume of the can is 500 cubic centimeters:\n\n500 = πr^2h\n\nWe want to minimize the surface area, so we will first solve the volume equation for h and then substitute it into the surface area equation:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the surface area equation:\n\nA = 2πr(500 / (πr^2)) + 2πr^2\nA = (1000 / r) + 2πr^2\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we will find the critical points by taking the derivative of A with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dr = -1000 / r^2 + 4πr\n\nNow, set dA/dr = 0 and solve for r:\n\n0 = -1000 / r^2 + 4πr\n1000 / r^2 = 4πr\n1000 = 4πr^3\nr^3 = 1000 / (4π)\nr^3 = 250 / π\nr = (250 / π)^(1/3)\n\nNow that we have the value for r, we can find the value for h using the expression we found earlier:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\nh = 500 / (π(250 / π)^(2/3))\nh = 500 / (250^(2/3))\nh = 2(250 / π)^(1/3)\n\nSo, the dimensions of the can with the smallest surface area are:\n\nr ≈ (250 / π)^(1/3) cm\nh ≈ 2(250 / π)^(1/3) cm"
