    "message_2": "Let z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. Then, the given condition |z - 1| = 3 can be written as:\n\n|(x - 1) + yi| = 3\n\nTaking the square of both sides, we get:\n\n(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 9\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum and minimum value of |z + 2|, which can be written as:\n\n|(x + 2) + yi|\n\nTaking the square of both sides, we get:\n\n(x + 2)^2 + y^2\n\nWe can rewrite this expression using the given condition:\n\n(x + 2)^2 + y^2 = (x - 1)^2 + 9\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 + 4x + 4 + y^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 9\n\n6x = 6\n\nx = 1\n\nNow, substituting x = 1 back into the equation (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 9, we get:\n\ny^2 = 8\n\nThe maximum and minimum values of |z + 2| will occur when y is at its maximum and minimum values, which are y = ±√8.\n\nWhen y = √8, |z + 2| = |(1 + 2) + √8i| = |3 + √8i| = √(3^2 + (√8)^2) = √(9 + 8) = √17.\n\nWhen y = -√8, |z + 2| = |(1 + 2) - √8i| = |3 - √8i| = √(3^2 + (-√8)^2) = √(9 + 8) = √17.\n\nTherefore, the maximum and minimum value of |z + 2| is √17."
