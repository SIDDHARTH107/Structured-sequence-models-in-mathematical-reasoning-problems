    "message_1": "What is the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = x^2 in the context of heat transfer problems, if the initial temperature distribution on a rod of length L is given by this function, and the ends of the rod are held at constant temperatures of 0 and 100 degrees Celsius? Calculate the temperature distribution on the rod at time t = 10 seconds using the Fourier transform.",
    "message_2": "To solve this heat transfer problem, we will use the heat equation and its solution in terms of Fourier series. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂u(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²u(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere u(x,t) is the temperature distribution along the rod at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\nu(0,t) = 0\nu(L,t) = 100\n\nThe initial condition is:\nu(x,0) = x^2\n\nWe will solve this problem using the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form:\n\nu(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x) dT(t)/dt = α T(t) d²X(x)/dx²\n\nDividing both sides by αXT, we get:\n\n(1/αT) dT(t)/dt = (1/X) d²X(x)/dx²\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on space, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nd²X(x)/dx² + λ²X(x) = 0\n(1/α) dT(t)/dt + λ²T(t) = 0\n\nThe first equation is the spatial equation, and its solutions are given by:\n\nX(x) = A cos(λx) + B sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\nX(0) = A = 0\nX(L) = B sin(λL) = 100\n\nSo, X(x) = B sin(λx) and λL = (2n-1)π/2 for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficients B_n and the time-dependent part T(t). The second equation is the temporal equation, and its solution is given by:\n\nT(t) = C exp(-αλ²t)\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nu(x,t) = Σ [B_n sin(λ_n x) exp(-αλ_n²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients B_n, we use the initial condition:\n\nx^2 = Σ [B_n sin(λ_n x)]\n\nWe can find B_n using the orthogonality property of sine functions:\n\nB_n = (2/L) ∫[0,L] (x^2 sin(λ_n x) dx)\n\nNow, we have all the components to calculate the temperature distribution at t = 10 seconds:\n\nu(x,10) = Σ [(2/L) ∫[0,L] (x^2 sin(λ_n x) dx) sin(λ_n x) exp(-αλ_n²10)]\n\nThis is an infinite series, and we can approximate the solution by taking a finite number of terms. The more terms we take, the better the approximation. Note that the actual calculation of the integral and the sum depends on the values of L and α, which are not provided in the problem statement."
