    "message_1": "A sector of a circle has a radius of 12 cm and an angle of 60°. What is the perimeter of the sector?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the sector, we need to calculate the length of the arc and then add the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (angle/360) * 2πr\n\nwhere angle is the angle of the sector (in degrees) and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the angle is 60° and the radius is 12 cm.\n\nArc length = (60/360) * 2π(12)\nArc length = (1/6) * 24π\nArc length = 4π cm\n\nNow, let's add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = Arc length + 2 * radius\nPerimeter = 4π + 2 * 12\nPerimeter = 4π + 24\n\nThe perimeter of the sector is 4π + 24 cm."
