    "message_2": "To prove that d = 4g - 4, we will use the concept of the Euler characteristic and the degree of a map.\n\nLet χ(X) denote the Euler characteristic of the surface X. For a closed orientable surface of genus g, we have χ(X) = 2 - 2g.\n\nNow, let's consider the map f: X → S^2. Since S^2 is a 2-dimensional sphere, its Euler characteristic is χ(S^2) = 2.\n\nThe degree of a map is a topological invariant that measures how many times the domain wraps around the codomain. In our case, the degree of the map f, denoted deg(f), is the number of times X wraps around S^2. Since the preimage of a generic point of S^2 consists of exactly d points, we have deg(f) = d.\n\nNow, we will use the following formula relating the Euler characteristics and the degree of the map:\n\nχ(X) = deg(f) * χ(S^2)\n\nSubstituting the known values of the Euler characteristics and the degree of the map, we get:\n\n2 - 2g = d * 2\n\nSolving for d, we obtain:\n\nd = 4g - 4\n\nThus, the preimage of a generic point of S^2 consists of exactly 4g - 4 points."
