    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides of length 18 cm and 24 cm, and the included angle between them is 120°. Find the perimeter of the triangle using trigonometry.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the triangle, we first need to find the length of the third side. We can use the Law of Cosines to do this. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn our case, we have a = 18 cm, b = 24 cm, and angle C = 120°. We can plug these values into the Law of Cosines formula to find the length of side c:\n\nc² = (18 cm)² + (24 cm)² - 2(18 cm)(24 cm) * cos(120°)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 120°. In degrees, cos(120°) = -1/2. Now we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nc² = (18 cm)² + (24 cm)² - 2(18 cm)(24 cm) * (-1/2)\n\nc² = 324 cm² + 576 cm² + 432 cm²\n\nc² = 1332 cm²\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √1332 cm ≈ 36.5 cm\n\nNow that we have the length of all three sides, we can find the perimeter of the triangle:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c = 18 cm + 24 cm + 36.5 cm ≈ 78.5 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 78.5 cm."
