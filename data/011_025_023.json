Two players take turns choosing a pile and removing any number of stones they want from that pile. The winner is the player who takes the last stone(s). Which player has a winning strategy and what is it?",
    "message_2": "In a game of Nim, the winning strategy is based on the concept of Nim-sum, which is the bitwise XOR operation of the number of stones in each pile. The player with the winning strategy is the one who can make the Nim-sum equal to zero after their move.\n\nFirst, let's find the Nim-sum of the given piles:\n5 (in binary: 0101)\n8 (in binary: 1000)\n10 (in binary: 1010)\nNim-sum: 0111 (7 in decimal)\n\nSince the Nim-sum is not zero, the first player has a winning strategy. The first player should aim to make the Nim-sum zero after their move. To do this, they should find a pile that, when XORed with the current Nim-sum, results in a value less than the number of stones in that pile.\n\nIn this case, the first player should choose the pile with 10 stones:\nNim-sum: 0111 (7 in decimal)\nPile with 10 stones: 1010 (10 in decimal)\n\nXOR operation: 1010\n               0111\n               ----\n               1101 (13 in decimal)\n\nThe first player should remove 3 stones from the pile with 10 stones, leaving piles of 5, 8, and 7 stones. Now the Nim-sum is zero:\n5 (in binary: 0101)\n8 (in binary: 1000)\n7 (in binary: 0111)\nNim-sum: 0000\n\nFrom this point, the first player can mimic the second player's moves on the other piles, ensuring that the Nim-sum remains zero after each of their turns. This will ultimately lead to the first player taking the last stone(s) and winning the game."
