    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of the vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(4^2 + 3^2 + (-2)^2) = √(16 + 9 + 4) = √29\n|B| = √(2^2 + (-5)^2 + 6^2) = √(4 + 25 + 36) = √65\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA · B = (4)(2) + (3)(-5) + (-2)(6) = 8 - 15 - 12 = -19\n\nUsing the dot product formula, we can find the cosine of the angle between the two vectors:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A||B|)\ncos(θ) = (-19) / (√29 * √65)\ncos(θ) ≈ -0.2193\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(-0.2193)\nθ ≈ 1.793 radians or 102.76 degrees\n\nNow, we can find the cross product A x B:\n\nA x B = |A||B|sin(θ)n\n\nFirst, we need to find the sine of the angle θ:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ 0.9757\n\nNow, we can find the cross product:\n\nA x B = (√29 * √65)(0.9757)n\nA x B ≈ 61.64n\n\nTo find the unit vector n, we can use the determinant method:\n\nn = (i  j  k)\n     (4  3 -2)\n     (2 -5  6)\n\nn = i(3*6 - (-2)*(-5)) - j(4*6 - 2*(-2)) + k(4*(-5) - 2*3)\nn = i(18 - 10) - j(24 + 4) + k(-20 - 6)\nn = 8i - 28j - 26k\n\nNow, we can find the cross product A x B:\n\nA x B = 61.64(8i - 28j - 26k)\nA x B = 492.12i - 1725.92j - 1602.64k\n\nSo, the cross product of A and B is 492.12i - 1725.92j - 1602.64k, and the angle between the two vectors is approximately 102.76 degrees or 1.793 radians."
