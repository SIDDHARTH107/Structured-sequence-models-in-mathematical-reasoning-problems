They have selected 5 items to bring, and each item has its own weight and value:\n\n- Tent: 4 kg, $120\n- Sleeping bag: 2.5 kg, $70\n- Water bottle: 0.5 kg, $5\n- Stove: 1.2 kg, $40\n- First aid kit: 1 kg, $25\n\nWhat combination of items should the student bring to maximize the value of the items they carry, while still staying under the weight limit of 10 kg?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will list all possible combinations of items that the student can bring while staying under the weight limit of 10 kg, and then find the combination with the highest total value.\n\n1. Tent + Sleeping bag + Water bottle + Stove + First aid kit\n   Weight: 4 + 2.5 + 0.5 + 1.2 + 1 = 9.2 kg (under 10 kg)\n   Value: $120 + $70 + $5 + $40 + $25 = $260\n\n2. Tent + Sleeping bag + Water bottle + Stove\n   Weight: 4 + 2.5 + 0.5 + 1.2 = 8.2 kg (under 10 kg)\n   Value: $120 + $70 + $5 + $40 = $235\n\n3. Tent + Sleeping bag + Water bottle + First aid kit\n   Weight: 4 + 2.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 8 kg (under 10 kg)\n   Value: $120 + $70 + $5 + $25 = $220\n\n4. Tent + Sleeping bag + Stove + First aid kit\n   Weight: 4 + 2.5 + 1.2 + 1 = 8.7 kg (under 10 kg)\n   Value: $120 + $70 + $40 + $25 = $255\n\n5. Tent + Water bottle + Stove + First aid kit\n   Weight: 4 + 0.5 + 1.2 + 1 = 6.7 kg (under 10 kg)\n   Value: $120 + $5 + $40 + $25 = $190\n\n6. Sleeping bag + Water bottle + Stove + First aid kit\n   Weight: 2.5 + 0.5 + 1.2 + 1 = 5.2 kg (under 10 kg)\n   Value: $70 + $5 + $40 + $25 = $140\n\nAmong these combinations, the one with the highest value is the first combination (Tent + Sleeping bag + Water bottle + Stove + First aid kit) with a total value of $260. The student should bring all the items to maximize the value of the items they carry while staying under the weight limit of 10 kg."
