    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Prime factorize the order of the group: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the possible divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120\n3. Use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their properties.\n\nLet's analyze the Sylow subgroups:\n\n- Sylow 2-subgroups: There are n_2 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8. By Sylow's third theorem, n_2 must divide 15 (the index of the 2-subgroup), and n_2 must be congruent to 1 mod 2. So, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n- Sylow 3-subgroups: There are n_3 Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3. By Sylow's third theorem, n_3 must divide 40 (the index of the 3-subgroup), and n_3 must be congruent to 1 mod 3. So, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10.\n- Sylow 5-subgroups: There are n_5 Sylow 5-subgroups of order 5. By Sylow's third theorem, n_5 must divide 24 (the index of the 5-subgroup), and n_5 must be congruent to 1 mod 5. So, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups and their properties:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there is only one group of order 120, which is the cyclic group Z_120.\n2. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 1, then there is a semidirect product of the normal Sylow 3-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup by the Sylow 2-subgroup. There are two non-isomorphic groups of order 8 (Z_8 and Z_2 × Z_4), so there are two possible semidirect products in this case.\n3. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, and n_5 = 1, then there is a semidirect product of the normal Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 5-subgroup by the Sylow 3-subgroup. There are two possible semidirect products in this case.\n4. If n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, and n_5 = 6, then there is a semidirect product of the normal Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup by the Sylow 5-subgroup. There is only one possible semidirect product in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 1 (cyclic group) + 2 (case 2) + 2 (case 3) + 1 (case 4) = 6 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
