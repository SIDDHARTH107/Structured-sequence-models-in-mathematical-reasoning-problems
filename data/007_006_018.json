    "message_2": "To find the GCD of 240 and 180 using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the larger number (240) by the smaller number (180) and find the remainder.\n   240 รท 180 = 1 with a remainder of 60.\n\n2. Replace the larger number (240) with the smaller number (180) and the smaller number with the remainder (60).\n   Now, we need to find the GCD of 180 and 60.\n\n3. Divide the new larger number (180) by the new smaller number (60) and find the remainder.\n   180 รท 60 = 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 60. So, the GCD of 240 and 180 is 60."
