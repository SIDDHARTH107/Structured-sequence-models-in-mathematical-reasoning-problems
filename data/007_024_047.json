    "message_2": "To solve the equation 3^x ≡ 11 (mod 17), we will use the method of successive squaring to find the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the equation.\n\n1. Calculate the powers of 3 modulo 17:\n3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 17)\n3^2 ≡ 9 (mod 17)\n3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 10 (mod 17)\n3^4 ≡ 81 ≡ 13 (mod 17)\n3^5 ≡ 39 ≡ 5 (mod 17)\n3^6 ≡ 15 (mod 17)\n3^7 ≡ 45 ≡ 11 (mod 17)\n\n2. We found that 3^7 ≡ 11 (mod 17), so the smallest positive integer x that satisfies the equation is x = 7."
