Find the values of $u$ and $v$ on the boundary of $\\Omega$.",
    "message_2": "To find the values of $u$ and $v$ on the boundary of $\\Omega$, we first need to express $f(z) = z^3$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts. We can do this by substituting $z = x + iy$ and expanding the cube:\n\n$f(z) = (x + iy)^3 = (x^3 + 3x^2iy + 3xi^2y^2 + i^3y^3) = (x^3 - 3xy^2) + i(3x^2y - y^3)$.\n\nNow, we can identify the real and imaginary parts as $u(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2$ and $v(x, y) = 3x^2y - y^3$.\n\nThe boundary of $\\Omega$ is given by $|z| = 2$, or equivalently, $x^2 + y^2 = 4$. We need to find the values of $u$ and $v$ on this boundary. To do this, we can substitute $x^2 + y^2 = 4$ into the expressions for $u$ and $v$:\n\n$u(x, y) = x^3 - 3xy^2 = x(x^2 - 3y^2) = x(4 - y^2 - 3y^2) = 4x(1 - y^2)$,\n\n$v(x, y) = 3x^2y - y^3 = y(3x^2 - y^2) = y(3(4 - y^2) - y^2) = 4y(3 - y^2)$.\n\nSo, on the boundary of $\\Omega$, the values of $u$ and $v$ are given by:\n\n$u(x, y) = 4x(1 - y^2)$,\n\n$v(x, y) = 4y(3 - y^2)$."
