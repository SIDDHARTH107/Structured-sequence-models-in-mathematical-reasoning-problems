    "message_2": "To find the fractal dimension of the Lévy C curve, we can use the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere D is the fractal dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Lévy C curve, at each scaling level, the length is halved, so the scaling factor s = 2. The Lévy C curve is formed by two copies of itself at each iteration, so N = 2.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(2) / log(2)\n\nD = 1\n\nThe fractal dimension of the Lévy C curve is 1. However, it's important to note that this result is specific to the given condition where the length at each scaling level is halved. The actual Lévy C curve has a fractal dimension greater than 1, approximately 1.934."
