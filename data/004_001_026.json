    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5, we will apply the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nFor f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5, we will differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe derivative of 3x^2 is:\n(2)(3)x^(2-1) = 6x\n\nThe derivative of 2x is:\n(1)(2)x^(1-1) = 2\n\nThe derivative of -5 (a constant) is 0.\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) is:\nf'(x) = 6x + 2\n\nNow, we will find the value of the derivative at the point x = 4.\n\nf'(4) = 6(4) + 2\nf'(4) = 24 + 2\nf'(4) = 26\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 at the point x = 4 is 26."
