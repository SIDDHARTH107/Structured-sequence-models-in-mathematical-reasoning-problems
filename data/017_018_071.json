    "message_1": "How many isomorphism classes of groups of order 32 are there? Can you list all the groups from each isomorphism class, and determine which isomorphism class each group belongs to?",
    "message_2": "There are 51 isomorphism classes of groups of order 32. Listing all the groups from each isomorphism class is a bit cumbersome, but I can provide a general description of each class and the groups that belong to it.\n\n1. Cyclic group: There is only one cyclic group of order 32, denoted by C_32.\n\n2. Direct product of cyclic groups: There are several groups that can be formed by taking the direct product of cyclic groups. These are:\n\n   a. C_2 × C_16\n   b. C_4 × C_8\n   c. C_2 × C_2 × C_8\n   d. C_4 × C_4 × C_2\n   e. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_4\n   f. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_2\n\n3. Quotient groups: There are several groups that can be formed by taking the quotient of a larger group by a normal subgroup. Some examples include:\n\n   a. QD_32: The generalized quaternion group of order 32.\n   b. D_32: The dihedral group of order 32.\n\n4. Semidirect products: There are several groups that can be formed by taking the semidirect product of two groups. Some examples include:\n\n   a. C_16 ⋊ C_2\n   b. C_8 ⋊ C_4\n   c. C_4 ⋊ C_8\n   d. C_2 × C_8 ⋊ C_2\n   e. C_4 × C_4 ⋊ C_2\n   f. C_2 × C_2 × C_4 ⋊ C_2\n\n5. Extensions: There are several groups that can be formed as extensions of smaller groups. Some examples include:\n\n   a. Extensions of C_2 by C_16\n   b. Extensions of C_4 by C_8\n   c. Extensions of C_8 by C_4\n   d. Extensions of C_2 × C_2 by C_8\n   e. Extensions of C_4 × C_2 by C_4\n   f. Extensions of C_2 × C_2 × C_2 by C_4\n\nNote that the groups listed in categories 2-5 are not exhaustive, and there are more groups within each category. To determine which isomorphism class a group belongs to, one can examine its structure, such as its generators, relations, and subgroups, and compare it to the known structures of the groups in each isomorphism class."
