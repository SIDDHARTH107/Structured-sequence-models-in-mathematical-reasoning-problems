    "message_2": "To solve the polynomial equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0, we can try to factor the polynomial and find its roots.\n\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p is a factor of the constant term (in this case, 6) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (in this case, 1). So, the possible rational roots are the factors of 6, which are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6.\n\nWe can test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial:\n\n1. For x = 1:\n(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0\nSo, x = 1 is a root of the polynomial.\n\nNow we can perform synthetic division to find the remaining polynomial:\n\n1 |  1  -6  11  -6\n       1  -5   6\n  ---------------\n      1  -5   6   0\n\nThe remaining polynomial is x^2 - 5x + 6. We can now factor this quadratic polynomial:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)\n\nSo, the roots of the quadratic polynomial are x = 2 and x = 3.\n\nTherefore, the roots of the original polynomial equation x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0 are x = 1, x = 2, and x = 3."
