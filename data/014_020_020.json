    "message_1": "Suppose a Vigenere cipher is encrypted with a keyword \"MATH\" and the plaintext message is \"CALCULUS\". If the resulting ciphertext is \"EHSZQAAL\", what is the decryption of the ciphertext back to the original plaintext message using the keyword \"MATH\"?",
    "message_2": "To decrypt the Vigenère cipher, we will use the reverse process of encryption. The Vigenère cipher uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A table of alphabets can be used, termed a tabula recta, Vigenère square, or Vigenère table. It consists of the alphabet written out 26 times in different rows, each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar ciphers. At different points in the encryption process, the cipher uses a different alphabet from one of the rows. The alphabet used at each point depends on a repeating keyword.\n\nHere's the decryption process step by step:\n\n1. Write down the ciphertext: EHSZQAAL\n2. Write down the keyword below it, repeating it as necessary: MATHMATH\n3. For each letter pair, find the row in the Vigenère square that starts with the keyword letter, and then find the column with the ciphertext letter. The letter at the intersection of the row and column is the decrypted letter.\n\nLet's decrypt the ciphertext:\n\nE H S Z Q A A L\nM A T H M A T H\n\nE -> M: C (row M, column E)\nH -> A: A (row A, column H)\nS -> T: L (row T, column S)\nZ -> H: C (row H, column Z)\nQ -> M: U (row M, column Q)\nA -> A: L (row A, column A)\nA -> T: U (row T, column A)\nL -> H: S (row H, column L)\n\nThe decrypted plaintext message is: CALCULUS"
