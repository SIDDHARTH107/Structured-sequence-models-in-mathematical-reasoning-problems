    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 5, we need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the first derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined. \n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 5) = 6x^2 - 6x - 12\n\nNow, we will use Newton's method to find the value of x that makes f'(x) = 0. Newton's method is an iterative method that can be used to find the roots of a real-valued function. The formula for Newton's method is:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)\n\nIn our case, we are trying to find the root of f'(x), so we will use:\n\nx_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n) / f''(x_n)\n\nFirst, let's find the second derivative of the function:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx(6x^2 - 6x - 12) = 12x - 6\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method. We will start with an initial guess, x_0. Let's choose x_0 = 1:\n\nx_1 = x_0 - f'(x_0) / f''(x_0) = 1 - (6(1)^2 - 6(1) - 12) / (12(1) - 6) = 1 - (-6) / 6 = 2\n\nNow, we will iterate until we reach a desired level of accuracy. For simplicity, let's do one more iteration:\n\nx_2 = x_1 - f'(x_1) / f''(x_1) = 2 - (6(2)^2 - 6(2) - 12) / (12(2) - 6) = 2 - (24) / 18 = 2 - 4/3 = 2/3\n\nWe can continue iterating if we want more accuracy, but for now, we will stop here. So, the value of x that minimizes the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 12x + 5 is approximately x = 2/3."
