    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(r)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and r is the scaling factor (the ratio of the length of the initial square to the side length of the first inner square).\n\nFor the Vicsek fractal with a ratio of 1:3, there are 5 self-similar pieces (the four corners and the center square) and the scaling factor is 3.\n\nSo, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nD = log(5) / log(3)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.465\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with a ratio of 1:3 is approximately 1.465. Note that this value is independent of the depth of the fractal (7 levels in this case), as the Hausdorff dimension is a property of the fractal itself and not dependent on the number of iterations."
