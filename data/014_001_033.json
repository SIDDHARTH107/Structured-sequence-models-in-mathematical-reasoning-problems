    "message_2": "To find the private key d, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Factor n into its two prime factors, p and q.\n2. Compute the Euler's totient function, φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1).\n3. Find the modular inverse of e (mod φ(n)), which is the value of d.\n\nGiven n = 95, we can factor it into its prime factors: 95 = 5 * 19, so p = 5 and q = 19.\n\nNow, compute the Euler's totient function:\nφ(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = (5-1)(19-1) = 4 * 18 = 72.\n\nNext, we need to find the modular inverse of e (mod φ(n)). In other words, we need to find a value for d such that:\n\ne * d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))\n\nIn our case, e = 7 and φ(n) = 72. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse:\n\n7 * d ≡ 1 (mod 72)\n\nAfter applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that d = 31. Therefore, the private key is d = 31."
