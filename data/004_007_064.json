    "message_2": "To find h'(π/2), we will first need to find h(x) and then differentiate it with respect to x. Since h(x) = f(g(x)), we will substitute g(x) into f(x) to find h(x).\n\nh(x) = f(g(x)) = f(cos(x))\n\nNow, substitute cos(x) into f(x):\n\nh(x) = 3(cos(x))^2 - 2cos(x) + 1\n\nNow we need to find the derivative of h(x) with respect to x, which is h'(x):\n\nh'(x) = d/dx [3(cos(x))^2 - 2cos(x) + 1]\n\nTo find the derivative, we will use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is 3u^2 - 2u + 1 and the inner function is u = cos(x).\n\nh'(x) = d/dx [3(cos(x))^2] - d/dx [2cos(x)] + d/dx [1]\n\nNow, we will find the derivatives of each term:\n\nd/dx [3(cos(x))^2] = 6cos(x) * (-sin(x)) = -6cos(x)sin(x)\nd/dx [2cos(x)] = -2sin(x)\nd/dx [1] = 0\n\nNow, substitute the derivatives back into h'(x):\n\nh'(x) = -6cos(x)sin(x) - 2sin(x)\n\nNow, we need to find h'(π/2):\n\nh'(π/2) = -6cos(π/2)sin(π/2) - 2sin(π/2)\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1, we have:\n\nh'(π/2) = -6(0)(1) - 2(1) = -2\n\nSo, h'(π/2) = -2."
