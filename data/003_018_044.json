    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = 3sin(2x) - 2cos(3x) with respect to x, we will apply the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.\n\nFor the first term, 3sin(2x), the outer function is 3sin(u) and the inner function is u = 2x. The derivative of the outer function with respect to u is 3cos(u), and the derivative of the inner function with respect to x is 2. Applying the chain rule, we get:\n\nd(3sin(2x))/dx = 3cos(2x) * 2 = 6cos(2x)\n\nFor the second term, -2cos(3x), the outer function is -2cos(u) and the inner function is u = 3x. The derivative of the outer function with respect to u is 2sin(u), and the derivative of the inner function with respect to x is 3. Applying the chain rule, we get:\n\nd(-2cos(3x))/dx = 2sin(3x) * 3 = 6sin(3x)\n\nNow, we can combine the derivatives of both terms to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\ndy/dx = 6cos(2x) + 6sin(3x)"
