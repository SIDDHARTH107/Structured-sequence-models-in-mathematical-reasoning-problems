    "message_1": "Let X be a projective variety over a field k of dimension 3, and let Y be a subvariety of X with codimension 2. Let i: Y → X denote the inclusion map. Suppose that the intersection cohomology groups IH^3(Y) and IH^4(Y) are both one-dimensional k-vector spaces. Compute the dimension of the space of global sections of the sheaf Ri_* (IC_Y) on X, where Ri_* denotes the derived pushforward functor for the inclusion i.",
    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space of global sections of the sheaf Ri_* (IC_Y) on X, we will use the Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich formula, which relates the Euler characteristic of a sheaf to the dimensions of its cohomology groups. In our case, the formula states:\n\nχ(Ri_*(IC_Y)) = ∑ (-1)^i dim_k H^i(X, Ri_*(IC_Y))\n\nSince Y has codimension 2 in X, we have the following non-zero derived pushforwards:\n\nR^2i_*(IC_Y) and R^3i_*(IC_Y)\n\nThe other derived pushforwards are zero. Therefore, we have:\n\nχ(Ri_*(IC_Y)) = - dim_k H^2(X, R^2i_*(IC_Y)) + dim_k H^3(X, R^3i_*(IC_Y))\n\nNow, we use the fact that the intersection cohomology groups IH^3(Y) and IH^4(Y) are both one-dimensional k-vector spaces. By the definition of intersection cohomology, we have:\n\nIH^3(Y) = H^3(X, R^2i_*(IC_Y))\nIH^4(Y) = H^2(X, R^3i_*(IC_Y))\n\nSince both IH^3(Y) and IH^4(Y) are one-dimensional k-vector spaces, we have:\n\ndim_k H^3(X, R^2i_*(IC_Y)) = 1\ndim_k H^2(X, R^3i_*(IC_Y)) = 1\n\nPlugging these dimensions back into the Grothendieck-Ogg-Shafarevich formula, we get:\n\nχ(Ri_*(IC_Y)) = -1 + 1 = 0\n\nHowever, we are interested in the dimension of the space of global sections of the sheaf Ri_*(IC_Y) on X, which corresponds to the cohomology group H^0(X, Ri_*(IC_Y)). Since the Euler characteristic is zero, we have:\n\ndim_k H^0(X, Ri_*(IC_Y)) = 0\n\nThus, the dimension of the space of global sections of the sheaf Ri_*(IC_Y) on X is 0."
