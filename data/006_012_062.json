    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson probability formula, which is suitable for calculating the probability of a certain number of events occurring within a fixed interval, given the average rate of occurrence.\n\nThe Poisson probability formula is:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of x events occurring\n- λ (lambda) is the average rate of occurrence (in this case, 0.5 burglaries per week)\n- x is the number of events we want to calculate the probability for (in this case, 1 burglary)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- x! is the factorial of x (the product of all positive integers up to x)\n\nWe want to find the probability of 1 burglary occurring in a given week, so we will plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP(1) = (e^(-0.5) * 0.5^1) / 1!\n\nP(1) = (2.71828^(-0.5) * 0.5) / 1\n\nP(1) ≈ (0.60653 * 0.5) / 1\n\nP(1) ≈ 0.30327\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in the particular neighborhood in a given week is approximately 0.30327 or 30.33%."
