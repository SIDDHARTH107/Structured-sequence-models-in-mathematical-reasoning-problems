Specifically, find the magnitude and phase angle of the frequency response at a frequency of 2 radians/second.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency response of the system, we need to substitute s = jω in the transfer function G(s), where ω is the angular frequency and j is the imaginary unit.\n\nG(jω) = (jω + 1) / (ω^2 - 4jω + 3)\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude and phase angle of the frequency response at a frequency of 2 radians/second. We substitute ω = 2:\n\nG(j2) = (j2 + 1) / (2^2 - 4j2 + 3)\n\nG(j2) = (j2 + 1) / (4 - 8j + 3)\n\nG(j2) = (j2 + 1) / (7 - 8j)\n\nTo find the magnitude, we use the formula:\n\n|G(jω)| = √(real^2 + imaginary^2)\n\n|G(j2)| = √(1^2 + 2^2) / √(7^2 + (-8)^2)\n|G(j2)| = √(5) / √(113)\n|G(j2)| ≈ 0.469\n\nTo find the phase angle, we use the formula:\n\n∠G(jω) = arctan(imaginary/real)\n\n∠G(j2) = arctan(2/1) - arctan(-8/7)\n∠G(j2) ≈ 63.4° - (-48.4°)\n∠G(j2) ≈ 111.8°\n\nNow, let's determine the stability of the system. The denominator of the transfer function is a quadratic equation:\n\ns^2 - 4s + 3 = 0\n\nWe can find the roots of this equation to determine the poles of the system:\n\n(s - 3)(s - 1) = 0\n\nThe poles are s = 1 and s = 3. Since both poles are in the right half of the complex plane (positive real part), the system is unstable.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnitude of the frequency response at 2 radians/second is approximately 0.469, the phase angle is approximately 111.8°, and the system is unstable."
