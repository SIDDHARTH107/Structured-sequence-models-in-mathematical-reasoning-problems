    "message_1": "A trapezium has one parallel side of length 8 cm and another parallel side of length 12 cm. The two non-parallel sides are each 5 cm long. What is the perimeter of this trapezium in centimeters?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we simply add the lengths of all four sides. Since the two non-parallel sides are each 5 cm long, we have:\n\nPerimeter = 8 cm (first parallel side) + 12 cm (second parallel side) + 5 cm (first non-parallel side) + 5 cm (second non-parallel side)\nPerimeter = 8 + 12 + 5 + 5\nPerimeter = 30 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is 30 centimeters."
