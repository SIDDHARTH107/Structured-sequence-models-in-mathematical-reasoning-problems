    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 has 5 reward points to split with Player 2. If Player 2 rejects Player 1's offer, both receive 0 points. What is the minimum amount Player 1 should offer to ensure that Player 2 does not reject the offer assuming both players are rational?",
    "message_2": "Assuming both players are rational, Player 1 should offer the minimum amount that Player 2 would accept, which is 1 reward point. This is because if Player 2 rejects the offer, they would receive 0 points, so accepting 1 point is better than getting nothing. Therefore, the minimum amount Player 1 should offer is 1 reward point."
