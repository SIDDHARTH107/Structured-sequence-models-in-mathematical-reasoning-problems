    "message_2": "To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2. The derivative, f'(x), is given by:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is:\n\nx_new = x_old - f(x_old) / f'(x_old)\n\nWe will start with an initial guess, x0, and iterate using the formula until the difference between consecutive x values is less than 0.0001 (to ensure the result is accurate to four decimal places). Let's start with an initial guess of x0 = 1.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) = 1 - (1^3 - 2*1 - 2) / (3*1^2 - 2) = 1 - (-3 / 1) = 4\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = x1 - f(x1) / f'(x1) = 4 - (4^3 - 2*4 - 2) / (3*4^2 - 2) = 4 - (54 / 46) ≈ 2.8261\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = x2 - f(x2) / f'(x2) ≈ 2.8261 - ((2.8261)^3 - 2*(2.8261) - 2) / (3*(2.8261)^2 - 2) ≈ 1.9197\n\nIteration 4:\nx4 = x3 - f(x3) / f'(x3) ≈ 1.9197 - ((1.9197)^3 - 2*(1.9197) - 2) / (3*(1.9197)^2 - 2) ≈ 1.7694\n\nIteration 5:\nx5 = x4 - f(x4) / f'(x4) ≈ 1.7694 - ((1.7694)^3 - 2*(1.7694) - 2) / (3*(1.7694)^2 - 2) ≈ 1.7693\n\nThe difference between x4 and x5 is less than 0.0001, so we can stop iterating. The root of the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2, correct to four decimal places, is approximately x ≈ 1.7693."
