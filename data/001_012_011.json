    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: 3x^2 + 6x\nFactor out the common term 3x:\n3x(x + 2)\n\nDenominator: 2x^2 + 4x\nFactor out the common term 2x:\n2x(x + 2)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(3x(x + 2)) / (2x(x + 2))\n\nSince (x + 2) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n(3x) / (2x)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factor x:\n\n3 / 2\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n3/2"
