If Player B then decides to send half of their points back to Player A, what is the maximum amount of points that Player A can receive back?",
    "message_2": "In this situation, the maximum amount of points Player A can receive back is when they send all of their 10 points to Player B. \n\nWhen Player A sends 10 points, Player B receives triple the points, which is 3 * 10 = 30 points. \n\nIf Player B decides to send half of their points back to Player A, they will send 30 / 2 = 15 points back.\n\nSo, the maximum amount of points that Player A can receive back is 15 points."
