    "message_1": "In a Centipede game, two players A and B alternate taking turns. The game starts with a pot of $100. Every time a player takes their turn, they can either take 4 points from the pot or pass their turn. However, if a player passes their turn, the other player can take 10 points from the pot. The game ends when one player decides to take the pot. Calculate the minimum number of turns it takes for one player to take all $100 from the pot assuming both players always choose the most advantageous option.",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the game step by step to find the most advantageous option for both players.\n\n1. Player A starts the game. If they take 4 points, the pot will have 96 points left. If they pass, player B will have the opportunity to take 10 points, leaving 90 points in the pot.\n\n2. If player A took 4 points and player B takes 4 points, the pot will have 92 points left. If player B passes, player A will have the opportunity to take 10 points, leaving 86 points in the pot.\n\n3. If player A took 4 points, player B took 4 points, and player A takes 4 points again, the pot will have 88 points left. If player A passes, player B will have the opportunity to take 10 points, leaving 78 points in the pot.\n\nAt this point, we can see a pattern emerging. Both players will choose to take 4 points each turn, as passing would allow the other player to take 10 points, which is not advantageous. They will continue taking 4 points each until the pot has only 4 points left.\n\nSince both players take 4 points each turn, they collectively take 8 points per round. To reach 96 points (100 - 4), they need 12 rounds (96 / 8). In the 13th round, player A will take the last 4 points from the pot.\n\nSo, the minimum number of turns it takes for one player to take all $100 from the pot is 25 turns (12 rounds * 2 players + 1 turn for player A to take the last 4 points)."
