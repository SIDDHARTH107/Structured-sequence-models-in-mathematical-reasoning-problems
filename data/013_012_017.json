    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a numerical problem related to Stackelberg Competition:\n\nA company, BTL, is considering entering a market in which another company, XYZ, is already operating. BTL has determined that it can produce at a marginal cost of $10 per unit, while XYZ's marginal cost is $20 per unit. BTL expects that XYZ would produce 1,000 units if it enters the market.\n\nAssuming that BTL is the leader in a Stackelberg competition and XYZ is the follower, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What quantity BTL should produce to maximize its profit?\n2. What quantity will XYZ produce in response?\n3. What will be the market price when both companies enter the market? \n\nAssume that demand in the market is given by Q = 2,000 – P, where Q is the total quantity of the product demanded and P is the market price.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the reaction function for XYZ and then find the profit-maximizing quantity for BTL.\n\n1. First, let's find the reaction function for XYZ. The inverse demand function is given by P = 2000 - Q, where Q = q_BTL + q_XYZ. We can rewrite this as P = 2000 - (q_BTL + q_XYZ).\n\n2. XYZ's total revenue is given by TR_XYZ = P * q_XYZ = (2000 - (q_BTL + q_XYZ)) * q_XYZ.\n\n3. XYZ's total cost is given by TC_XYZ = 20 * q_XYZ.\n\n4. XYZ's profit is given by π_XYZ = TR_XYZ - TC_XYZ = (2000 - (q_BTL + q_XYZ)) * q_XYZ - 20 * q_XYZ.\n\n5. To find the reaction function, we need to maximize XYZ's profit with respect to q_XYZ. Taking the first-order derivative of π_XYZ with respect to q_XYZ and setting it equal to 0, we get:\n\nd(π_XYZ)/dq_XYZ = 2000 - 2*q_XYZ - q_BTL - 20 = 0\n\n6. Solving for q_XYZ, we get the reaction function for XYZ:\n\nq_XYZ = (1980 - q_BTL) / 2\n\nNow, let's find the profit-maximizing quantity for BTL.\n\n7. BTL's total revenue is given by TR_BTL = P * q_BTL = (2000 - (q_BTL + q_XYZ)) * q_BTL.\n\n8. BTL's total cost is given by TC_BTL = 10 * q_BTL.\n\n9. BTL's profit is given by π_BTL = TR_BTL - TC_BTL = (2000 - (q_BTL + q_XYZ)) * q_BTL - 10 * q_BTL.\n\n10. Substitute the reaction function for q_XYZ into the profit function for BTL:\n\nπ_BTL = (2000 - (q_BTL + (1980 - q_BTL) / 2)) * q_BTL - 10 * q_BTL\n\n11. Simplify the profit function:\n\nπ_BTL = (2000 - 990 + q_BTL/2) * q_BTL - 10 * q_BTL\n\n12. Take the first-order derivative of π_BTL with respect to q_BTL and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(π_BTL)/dq_BTL = 1010 + q_BTL - 20 = 0\n\n13. Solve for q_BTL:\n\nq_BTL = 990 - 1010 = -20\n\nSince a negative quantity doesn't make sense in this context, BTL should produce 0 units to maximize its profit.\n\nNow, let's find the quantity that XYZ will produce in response.\n\n14. Using the reaction function for XYZ:\n\nq_XYZ = (1980 - q_BTL) / 2 = (1980 - 0) / 2 = 990\n\nSo, XYZ will produce 990 units in response.\n\nFinally, let's find the market price when both companies enter the market.\n\n15. Using the inverse demand function:\n\nP = 2000 - (q_BTL + q_XYZ) = 2000 - (0 + 990) = 1010\n\nThe market price when both companies enter the market will be $1,010."
