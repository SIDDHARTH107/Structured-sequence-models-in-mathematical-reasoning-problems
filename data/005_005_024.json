    "message_2": "To find the probability, we need to determine the number of successful outcomes (rolling a sum of 10 or greater) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any combination of two dice).\n\nThere are a total of 6 sides on each die, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nNow, let's find the successful outcomes (rolling a sum of 10 or greater):\n\n1. (4, 6) - sum is 10\n2. (5, 5) - sum is 10\n3. (6, 4) - sum is 10\n4. (5, 6) - sum is 11\n5. (6, 5) - sum is 11\n6. (6, 6) - sum is 12\n\nThere are 6 successful outcomes.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a sum of 10 or greater on two fair six-sided dice is:\n\nP(sum ≥ 10) = (number of successful outcomes) / (total number of possible outcomes) = 6 / 36 = 1 / 6 ≈ 0.1667 or 16.67%."
