    "message_2": "An Apollonian gasket is a fractal generated by repeatedly filling the interstices between circles with smaller circles. In this problem, we are asked to find the maximum number of circles that can be placed inside a given circle in an Apollonian gasket of order 4, where the radius of the largest circle is 1 and the radius of the smallest circle is 1/13.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Descartes Circle Theorem, which relates the curvatures of four mutually tangent circles. The theorem states that if the curvatures of three mutually tangent circles are k1, k2, and k3, then there are two possible values for the curvature of the fourth circle, k4:\n\nk4 = k1 + k2 + k3 ± 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\n\nIn an Apollonian gasket, the circles are arranged in such a way that they are all tangent to each other. We can use the Descartes Circle Theorem to find the curvatures of the circles in the gasket.\n\nFor the largest circle with radius 1, the curvature k1 is the reciprocal of the radius: k1 = 1/1 = 1. For the smallest circle with radius 1/13, the curvature k4 is the reciprocal of the radius: k4 = 13.\n\nNow we can use the Descartes Circle Theorem to find the curvatures of the other two circles in the gasket. Let's denote their curvatures as k2 and k3. We have:\n\nk4 = k1 + k2 + k3 ± 2 * sqrt(k1 * k2 + k2 * k3 + k3 * k1)\n\n13 = 1 + k2 + k3 ± 2 * sqrt(k2 + k3 + k1 * k2 * k3)\n\nWe can solve this equation for k2 and k3, but since we are only interested in the maximum number of circles that can be placed inside the given circle, we can use a simpler approach.\n\nIn an Apollonian gasket of order 4, there are 4 layers of circles. The first layer contains the largest circle, the second layer contains the three circles that are tangent to the largest circle, the third layer contains the circles that are tangent to the circles in the second layer, and so on.\n\nFor each layer, the number of circles doubles. So, in the second layer, there are 3 circles, in the third layer, there are 6 circles, and in the fourth layer, there are 12 circles.\n\nThe total number of circles in an Apollonian gasket of order 4 is the sum of the number of circles in each layer:\n\n1 (largest circle) + 3 (second layer) + 6 (third layer) + 12 (fourth layer) = 22 circles\n\nSo, the maximum number of circles that can be placed inside a given circle in an Apollonian gasket of order 4, where the radius of the largest and smallest circles is 1 and 1/13, respectively, is 22 circles."
