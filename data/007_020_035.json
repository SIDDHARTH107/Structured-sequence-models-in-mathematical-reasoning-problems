    "message_2": "To encrypt the message M = 1234 using RSA encryption with given p = 7, q = 11, and e = 13, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute n = p * q\n2. Compute the totient function φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n3. Calculate the ciphertext C using the RSA encryption formula: C ≡ M^e (mod n)\n\nStep 1: Compute n = p * q\nn = 7 * 11 = 77\n\nStep 2: Compute the totient function φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\nφ(n) = (7-1) * (11-1) = 6 * 10 = 60\n\nStep 3: Calculate the ciphertext C using the RSA encryption formula: C ≡ M^e (mod n)\nC ≡ 1234^13 (mod 77)\n\nTo calculate 1234^13 (mod 77), we can use the exponentiation by squaring method:\n\n1234^1 (mod 77) = 1234 (mod 77) = 47\n1234^2 (mod 77) = 47^2 (mod 77) = 2209 (mod 77) = 4\n1234^4 (mod 77) = 4^2 (mod 77) = 16 (mod 77) = 16\n1234^8 (mod 77) = 16^2 (mod 77) = 256 (mod 77) = 25\n\nNow, we can multiply the results together:\n1234^13 (mod 77) = 1234^8 * 1234^4 * 1234^1 (mod 77) = 25 * 16 * 47 (mod 77) = 18800 (mod 77) = 48\n\nSo, the ciphertext C is 48."
