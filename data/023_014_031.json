    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given wave function, we will use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[ψ(x) * e^(-ikx)] dx, where the integral is taken over all x from -∞ to ∞.\n\nGiven ψ(x) = Ae^(-ax^2), we have:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[Ae^(-ax^2) * e^(-ikx)] dx\n\nNow, let's combine the exponential terms:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[Ae^(-ax^2 - ikx)] dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we will complete the square in the exponent:\n\n-ax^2 - ikx = -a(x^2 + (ik/a)x)\n\nNow, we add and subtract the square of half of the coefficient of x inside the parentheses:\n\n-ax^2 - ikx = -a[(x + (ik/2a))^2 - (k^2/4a^2)]\n\nNow, we can rewrite the Fourier transform as:\n\nF(k) = (1/√(2π)) ∫[Ae^(-a(x + (ik/2a))^2) * e^(k^2/4a)] dx\n\nThe second exponential term does not depend on x, so we can take it out of the integral:\n\nF(k) = (A/√(2π)) * e^(k^2/4a) * ∫[e^(-a(x + (ik/2a))^2)] dx\n\nNow, let's make a substitution: u = x + (ik/2a), and du = dx. The limits of integration remain the same, as they are from -∞ to ∞.\n\nF(k) = (A/√(2π)) * e^(k^2/4a) * ∫[e^(-au^2)] du\n\nThe integral is now a Gaussian integral, which has the value √(π/a):\n\nF(k) = (A/√(2π)) * e^(k^2/4a) * √(π/a)\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nF(k) = A * √(π/2a) * e^(k^2/4a)\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the given wave function."
