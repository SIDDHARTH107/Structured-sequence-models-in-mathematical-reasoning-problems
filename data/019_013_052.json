    "message_2": "To determine whether the formula $\\Phi(x)$ is true or false for the set $x=\\{1,2,3\\}$, we need to find a set $S$ such that every element in $x$ is equal to an element in $S$.\n\nLet's consider the set $S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. For every element $a$ in $x$, there exists an element $b$ in $S$ such that $a = b$. Specifically:\n\n- For $a = 1$, there exists $b = 1$ in $S$ such that $a = b$.\n- For $a = 2$, there exists $b = 2$ in $S$ such that $a = b$.\n- For $a = 3$, there exists $b = 3$ in $S$ such that $a = b$.\n\nSince we found a set $S$ that satisfies the condition in the formula $\\Phi(x)$, the formula is true for the set $x = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$."
