    "message_1": "A cone has a radius of 6 cm and a slant height of 10 cm. What is the total surface area of the cone?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of the cone, we need to find the area of the base and the lateral surface area, and then add them together.\n\nThe base of the cone is a circle, so we can find its area using the formula for the area of a circle: A = πr^2, where r is the radius.\n\nA_base = π(6 cm)^2 = 36π cm^2\n\nThe lateral surface area of the cone can be found using the formula: A_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius and s is the slant height.\n\nA_lateral = π(6 cm)(10 cm) = 60π cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the total surface area by adding the base area and the lateral surface area:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral = 36π cm^2 + 60π cm^2 = 96π cm^2\n\nSo, the total surface area of the cone is 96π cm^2."
