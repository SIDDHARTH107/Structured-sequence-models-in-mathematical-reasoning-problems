    "message_1": "A wooden beam of length 10 meters is fixed at both ends. The beam is initially at rest, but suddenly a force of 100 N is applied to the midpoint of the beam. Using the Fourier transform, determine the displacement of the beam at any time t, assuming that the beam has a uniform cross-sectional area and is made of a material with Young's modulus of 2x10^11 N/m^2 and density of 7000 kg/m^3. The Fourier transform of the forcing function can be assumed to be F(w) = 100/(-jw), where j is the imaginary unit.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will first find the equation of motion for the beam and then apply the Fourier transform to find the displacement at any time t.\n\n1. Equation of motion for the beam:\n\nThe equation of motion for a beam fixed at both ends can be represented as:\n\nEI * (d^4 w(x,t) / dx^4) = ρA * (d^2 w(x,t) / dt^2) + F(x,t)\n\nwhere E is the Young's modulus, I is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-sectional area, w(x,t) is the displacement of the beam at position x and time t, ρ is the density of the material, A is the cross-sectional area, and F(x,t) is the forcing function.\n\n2. Apply the forcing function:\n\nThe force is applied at the midpoint of the beam (x = L/2), so the forcing function can be represented as:\n\nF(x,t) = 100 * δ(x - L/2) * u(t)\n\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta function and u(t) is the unit step function.\n\n3. Apply the Fourier transform:\n\nTaking the Fourier transform of the equation of motion with respect to time, we get:\n\nEI * (d^4 W(x,ω) / dx^4) = -ρA * ω^2 * W(x,ω) + F(x,ω)\n\nwhere W(x,ω) is the Fourier transform of w(x,t) and F(x,ω) is the Fourier transform of F(x,t), which is given as 100/(-jω).\n\n4. Solve for W(x,ω):\n\nThe above equation is a fourth-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. We can solve it using the boundary conditions for a beam fixed at both ends:\n\nw(0,t) = w(L,t) = 0\n(d^2 w(0,t) / dx^2) = (d^2 w(L,t) / dx^2) = 0\n\nApplying the inverse Fourier transform, we can find the displacement w(x,t) at any time t.\n\n5. Final solution:\n\nThe final solution for the displacement of the beam at any time t involves solving the fourth-order ODE and applying the inverse Fourier transform. This process is quite complex and requires advanced mathematical techniques. However, the general approach outlined above provides a framework for solving the problem using the Fourier transform."
