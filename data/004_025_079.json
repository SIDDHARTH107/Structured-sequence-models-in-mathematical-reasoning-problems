    "message_2": "To find the maximum height the ball reaches, we can use the following kinematic equation:\n\nv^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere v is the final velocity (0 m/s at the maximum height), u is the initial velocity (30 m/s), a is the acceleration due to gravity (-10 m/s^2, since it's acting downward), and s is the displacement (the maximum height).\n\n0^2 = 30^2 + 2(-10)s\n\n0 = 900 - 20s\n\n20s = 900\n\ns = 45 meters\n\nThe maximum height the ball reaches is 45 meters.\n\nTo find the time it takes to reach that height, we can use another kinematic equation:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity (0 m/s at the maximum height), u is the initial velocity (30 m/s), a is the acceleration due to gravity (-10 m/s^2), and t is the time.\n\n0 = 30 - 10t\n\n10t = 30\n\nt = 3 seconds\n\nIt takes 3 seconds for the ball to reach its maximum height of 45 meters."
