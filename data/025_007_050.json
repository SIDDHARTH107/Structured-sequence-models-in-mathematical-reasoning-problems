    "message_2": "The Euler characteristic χ(X, L) of a line bundle L on a projective curve X is defined as the alternating sum of the dimensions of the cohomology groups:\n\nχ(X, L) = h⁰(X, L) - h¹(X, L)\n\nGiven that h⁰(X, L) = n and h¹(X, L) = m, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\nχ(X, L) = n - m\n\nTherefore, the Euler characteristic χ(X, L) is equal to n - m."
