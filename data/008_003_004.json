    "message_2": "To determine the rank of a matrix, we need to find the number of linearly independent rows or columns. We can do this by performing Gaussian elimination to transform the matrix into its row echelon form.\n\nMatrix A:\n[[3, 1, 5],\n [2, 7, 1],\n [1, 2, 5]]\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 3 to have the smallest number in the top-left corner.\n[[1, 2, 5],\n [2, 7, 1],\n [3, 1, 5]]\n\nStep 2: Subtract 2 times row 1 from row 2, and subtract 3 times row 1 from row 3.\n[[1,  2,  5],\n [0,  3, -9],\n [0, -5, -10]]\n\nStep 3: Multiply row 2 by -1/3 to make the pivot element in the second row equal to 1.\n[[1,  2,  5],\n [0, -1,  3],\n [0, -5, -10]]\n\nStep 4: Add 5 times row 2 to row 3.\n[[1,  2,  5],\n [0, -1,  3],\n [0,  0,  5]]\n\nStep 5: Multiply row 2 by -1 and row 3 by 1/5 to make the pivot elements positive.\n[[1,  2,  5],\n [0,  1, -3],\n [0,  0,  1]]\n\nNow the matrix is in row echelon form. We can see that there are 3 non-zero rows, which means the rank of the matrix is 3."
