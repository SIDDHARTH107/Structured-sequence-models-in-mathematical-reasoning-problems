    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem on the topic of probability:\n\nSuppose that a certain type of technological failure causing a system to shut down occurs randomly and independently with a probability of 0.05 during a week of operation. If the system is operated for 52 weeks in a year, what is the probability that this type of technological failure occurs at least once during the year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. Instead of finding the probability that the failure occurs at least once, we will find the probability that the failure does not occur at all during the year and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that the failure does not occur in a single week is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nSince the system is operated for 52 weeks and the failures are independent, the probability that the failure does not occur in any of the 52 weeks is (0.95)^52.\n\nNow, we find the complementary probability by subtracting this value from 1:\n\nProbability of at least one failure = 1 - (0.95)^52 â‰ˆ 0.92\n\nSo, the probability that this type of technological failure occurs at least once during the year is approximately 0.92 or 92%."
