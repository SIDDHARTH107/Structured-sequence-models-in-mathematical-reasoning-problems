    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem a math student could solve on the subject of Topological Quantum Field Theory: \n\nConsider a closed oriented surface $\\Sigma$ of genus $g \\geq 1$, and let $\\text{Hom}(Z(\\Sigma))$ denote the space of homomorphisms from the group algebra $Z(\\Sigma)$ of closed loops on $\\Sigma$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. Let $Z_{TQFT}(\\Sigma)$ denote the value of the partition function of a certain topological quantum field theory on $\\Sigma$.\n\nSuppose that the TQFT satisfies the property that $Z_{TQFT}(\\Sigma)=\\sum_{\\rho} |\\text{Hom}_{\\mathbb{C}}(Z(\\Sigma), \\mathbb{C})_{\\rho}|^2$, where the sum runs over all irreducible representations $\\rho$ of $Z(\\Sigma)$ over $\\mathbb{C}$. \n\nDetermine the value of $Z_{TQFT}(\\Sigma)$ when $\\Sigma$ is the torus ($g=1$).",
    "message_2": "When $\\Sigma$ is the torus with genus $g=1$, the fundamental group of the torus is given by $\\pi_1(\\Sigma) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$, which is generated by two commuting elements, say $a$ and $b$. The group algebra $Z(\\Sigma)$ is then isomorphic to the group algebra of $\\pi_1(\\Sigma)$, which is $\\mathbb{C}[\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}]$.\n\nNow, we need to find the irreducible representations of $Z(\\Sigma)$. Since $Z(\\Sigma)$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}[\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}]$, its irreducible representations are one-dimensional and given by the characters of $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$. These characters are of the form $\\chi_{m,n}(a^k b^l) = e^{2\\pi i (mk + nl)}$, where $m, n, k, l \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe space of homomorphisms $\\text{Hom}_{\\mathbb{C}}(Z(\\Sigma), \\mathbb{C})_{\\rho}$ is one-dimensional for each irreducible representation $\\rho$, so $|\\text{Hom}_{\\mathbb{C}}(Z(\\Sigma), \\mathbb{C})_{\\rho}|^2 = 1$ for each $\\rho$. Since there are countably infinite irreducible representations of $Z(\\Sigma)$, the sum in the expression for $Z_{TQFT}(\\Sigma)$ is an infinite sum of ones.\n\nHowever, this sum is not absolutely convergent, and it is not appropriate to assign a numerical value to $Z_{TQFT}(\\Sigma)$ in this case. In other words, the problem is ill-posed, and the value of $Z_{TQFT}(\\Sigma)$ for the torus cannot be determined using the given formula."
