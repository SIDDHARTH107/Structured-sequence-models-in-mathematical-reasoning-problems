    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circular track, we use the formula:\n\nC = 2 * π * r\n\nwhere C is the circumference, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nSince the diameter is 100 meters, the radius (r) is half of the diameter, which is 50 meters.\n\nC = 2 * π * 50\nC ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 50\nC ≈ 6.28318 * 50\nC ≈ 314.159 meters\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the circular track is approximately 314.159 meters."
