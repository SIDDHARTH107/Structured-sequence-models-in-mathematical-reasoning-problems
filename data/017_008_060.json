    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 8. We will analyze the possible structures of G based on the number of elements of different orders in G.\n\nCase 1: G has an element of order 8.\nIf G has an element of order 8, say g, then G is generated by g, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8.\n\nCase 2: G has no elements of order 8, but has elements of order 4.\nLet g be an element of order 4 in G. Then the subgroup H = ⟨g⟩ generated by g has order 4, and |G/H| = 2. By the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup K of G with order 2. Since the intersection of H and K is trivial (only the identity element), we have that |HK| = |H||K| = 8, and HK = G.\n\nNow, let x be the element of order 2 in K. Since x is not in H, x^2 = e, and xgx^(-1) is not equal to g, we have that xgx^(-1) = g^(-1). Thus, G is generated by g and x, with the relations g^4 = e, x^2 = e, and xgx^(-1) = g^(-1). This is exactly the presentation of the dihedral group D4, so G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nCase 3: G has no elements of order 8 or 4, only elements of order 2.\nIn this case, G is an abelian group, since for any two elements a and b in G, we have (ab)^2 = a^2b^2, which implies ab = ba. Let a, b be two distinct elements of order 2 in G, and let H = ⟨a⟩ and K = ⟨b⟩. Then |H| = |K| = 2, and H ∩ K = {e}. Since G is abelian, HK is a subgroup of G, and |HK| = |H||K|/|H ∩ K| = 4. Let G' = G/HK. Then |G'| = 8/4 = 2, and G' is a cyclic group of order 2.\n\nLet x be a generator of G'. Then G = HKx, and x^2 = e. Since G is abelian, we have that xhx^(-1) = h for all h in H, and xkx^(-1) = k for all k in K. Thus, G is generated by a, b, and x, with the relations a^2 = b^2 = x^2 = e, and ab = ba, ax = xa, bx = xb. This is exactly the presentation of the quaternion group Q8, so G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 8 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the dihedral group D4, or the quaternion group Q8."
