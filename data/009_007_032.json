    "message_1": "Sure, here is a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA fluid flows steadily between two parallel plates that are 0.05 m apart. If the velocity of the fluid at the bottom plate is 0.2 m/s and the velocity at the top plate is 0.4 m/s, what is the shear stress at the bottom plate? \n\nThe fluid has a dynamic viscosity of 0.01 Pa-s and a density of 1000 kg/m³. Use Navier-Stokes equations to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations for a steady, incompressible, and fully developed flow between two parallel plates. In this case, the pressure gradient is zero, and the only force acting on the fluid is the viscous force. The simplified equation is:\n\n∂²u/∂y² = 0\n\nwhere u is the velocity in the x-direction and y is the distance from the bottom plate.\n\nSince the second derivative of u with respect to y is zero, the velocity profile u(y) must be a linear function of y:\n\nu(y) = Ay + B\n\nWe can use the boundary conditions to find the constants A and B. At the bottom plate (y = 0), the velocity is 0.2 m/s:\n\nu(0) = A(0) + B = 0.2 m/s\nB = 0.2 m/s\n\nAt the top plate (y = 0.05 m), the velocity is 0.4 m/s:\n\nu(0.05) = A(0.05) + 0.2 = 0.4 m/s\nA = (0.4 - 0.2) / 0.05 = 4 m/s²\n\nSo the velocity profile is:\n\nu(y) = 4y + 0.2\n\nNow we can find the shear stress at the bottom plate. The shear stress is given by:\n\nτ = μ(∂u/∂y)\n\nwhere τ is the shear stress, μ is the dynamic viscosity, and ∂u/∂y is the first derivative of the velocity profile with respect to y. Taking the derivative of u(y) with respect to y, we get:\n\n∂u/∂y = 4\n\nNow we can find the shear stress at the bottom plate (y = 0):\n\nτ = μ(∂u/∂y) = 0.01 Pa-s * 4 = 0.04 Pa\n\nSo the shear stress at the bottom plate is 0.04 Pa."
