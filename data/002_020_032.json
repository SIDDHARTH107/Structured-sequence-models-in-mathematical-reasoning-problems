    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector with a central angle of 60 degrees, we need to calculate the length of the arc and the two radii that form the sector.\n\nFirst, let's find the radius of the pizza. Since the diameter is 14 inches, the radius (r) is half of that:\n\nr = 14 / 2 = 7 inches\n\nNow, let's find the length of the arc. The formula for the length of an arc (s) is:\n\ns = (θ/360) * 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees and r is the radius. In this case, θ = 60 degrees and r = 7 inches. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\ns = (60/360) * 2π(7)\ns = (1/6) * 14π\ns = 7π/3 inches\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the sector, we need to add the length of the arc (s) and the two radii (each of length 7 inches):\n\nPerimeter = s + 2r\nPerimeter = (7π/3) + 2(7)\nPerimeter = (7π/3) + 14\n\nSo, the perimeter of the 60-degree sector of the pizza is (7π/3) + 14 inches."
