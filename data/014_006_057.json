    "message_1": "Given the message \"HELLO\" encoded using the One-time pad encryption with the key \"XYKRV\", what is the encoded message?",
    "message_2": "To encode the message \"HELLO\" using the One-time pad encryption with the key \"XYKRV\", we need to perform an XOR operation on each corresponding character of the message and the key. We can do this by converting each character to its ASCII value, performing the XOR operation, and then converting the result back to a character.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Convert each character of the message and the key to their ASCII values:\n   H (72), E (69), L (76), L (76), O (79)\n   X (88), Y (89), K (75), R (82), V (86)\n\n2. Perform the XOR operation on each pair of corresponding ASCII values:\n   72 XOR 88 = 24\n   69 XOR 89 = 20\n   76 XOR 75 = 3\n   76 XOR 82 = 22\n   79 XOR 86 = 29\n\n3. Convert the resulting ASCII values back to characters:\n   24 -> (char)24\n   20 -> (char)20\n   3 -> (char)3\n   22 -> (char)22\n   29 -> (char)29\n\n4. Combine the characters to form the encoded message:\n   (char)24 (char)20 (char)3 (char)22 (char)29\n\nPlease note that the resulting characters may not be printable or easily displayed, as they are not standard text characters. However, this is the encoded message using the One-time pad encryption with the given key."
