    "message_2": "There seems to be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_3$ refers to the space of curves of genus $3$, not elliptic curves. Elliptic curves are curves of genus $1$. So, I will restate the problem for elliptic curves and provide the solution accordingly.\n\nConsider the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_1$ of elliptic curves of genus $1$. Find the number of equivalence classes of these curves (up to isomorphism) that have an automorphism group of order $2$.\n\nAn elliptic curve is defined by a Weierstrass equation of the form:\n\n$y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants, and the discriminant $\\Delta = -16(4A^3 + 27B^2)$ is nonzero to ensure the curve is nonsingular.\n\nThe automorphism group of an elliptic curve is a subgroup of the group of projective transformations of the curve. For an elliptic curve, the automorphism group is either isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, or $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe are interested in the case where the automorphism group is of order $2$. This occurs when the curve has exactly one nontrivial automorphism, which is the negation map $(x, y) \\mapsto (x, -y)$. In this case, the curve is said to have \"no extra automorphisms.\"\n\nThe j-invariant is a function that classifies elliptic curves up to isomorphism. Two elliptic curves are isomorphic if and only if they have the same j-invariant. The j-invariant is given by:\n\n$j(E) = 1728 \\frac{4A^3}{4A^3 + 27B^2}$\n\nElliptic curves with distinct j-invariants have distinct automorphism groups. Therefore, to count the number of equivalence classes of elliptic curves with an automorphism group of order $2$, we need to count the number of distinct j-invariants for such curves.\n\nSince the j-invariant takes values in the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$, which is isomorphic to the Riemann sphere, it can take any complex value except for one \"point at infinity.\" However, for elliptic curves with no extra automorphisms, the j-invariant must be different from $0$ and $1728$, as these values correspond to curves with automorphism groups isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, respectively.\n\nThus, there are infinitely many equivalence classes of elliptic curves with an automorphism group of order $2$, as there are infinitely many complex numbers different from $0$ and $1728$ that the j-invariant can take."
