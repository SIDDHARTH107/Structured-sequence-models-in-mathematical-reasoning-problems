    "message_2": "To find the general solution to the given differential equation $y'' + 2y' + 2y = 0$, we will first find the characteristic equation and then solve it using complex analysis.\n\nThe characteristic equation is given by:\n\n$r^2 + 2r + 2 = 0$\n\nNow, we will solve this quadratic equation for r using the quadratic formula:\n\n$r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn our case, $a = 1$, $b = 2$, and $c = 2$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$r = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$r = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2}$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, we will have complex roots. Let's rewrite the square root term as a complex number:\n\n$r = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2i}{2}$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\n$r = -1 \\pm i$\n\nSo, we have two complex roots: $r_1 = -1 + i$ and $r_2 = -1 - i$. According to the theory of linear differential equations with constant coefficients, the general solution can be written as a linear combination of the solutions corresponding to these roots:\n\n$y(x) = C_1 e^{(-1 + i)x} + C_2 e^{(-1 - i)x}$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the complex exponentials using Euler's formula:\n\n$e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x)$\n\nApplying this to our general solution, we get:\n\n$y(x) = C_1 (e^{-x}(\\cos(x) + i\\sin(x))) + C_2 (e^{-x}(\\cos(x) - i\\sin(x)))$\n\nNow, we can separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n$y(x) = e^{-x}[(C_1 + C_2)\\cos(x) + (C_1 - C_2)i\\sin(x)]$\n\nSince the original differential equation is real, we can ignore the imaginary part and write the general solution as:\n\n$y(x) = e^{-x}[(C_1 + C_2)\\cos(x)]$\n\nLet $A = C_1 + C_2$ and $B = C_1 - C_2$. Then the general solution can be written as:\n\n$y(x) = e^{-x}(A\\cos(x) + Bi\\sin(x))$\n\nThis is the general solution to the given differential equation using complex analysis."
