    "message_2": "To prove the existence of a continuous extension g: X → [0,1] of f, we will use the concept of distance in metric spaces.\n\nLet x ∈ X. Define a function d: E → ℝ by d(y) = d(x, y), where d(x, y) is the distance between x and y in the metric space X. Since X is compact and E is closed, E is also compact. The function d is continuous, and since E is compact, d achieves its minimum on E. Let e ∈ E be the point where d achieves its minimum, i.e., d(e) = d(x, e) = min{d(x, y) : y ∈ E}.\n\nNow, we define the extension g: X → [0,1] as follows:\n\ng(x) = f(e) for all x ∈ X.\n\nWe claim that g is a continuous extension of f. First, note that g is well-defined, as f(e) is in [0,1] for all e ∈ E. Next, we show that g is continuous. Let x₀ ∈ X and ε > 0. Since f is continuous at e, there exists δ > 0 such that |f(y) - f(e)| < ε for all y ∈ E with d(y, e) < δ.\n\nLet x ∈ X with d(x, x₀) < δ. Then, d(x, e) ≤ d(x, x₀) + d(x₀, e) < δ + d(x₀, e). Since d(x₀, e) = min{d(x₀, y) : y ∈ E}, we have d(x, e) ≥ d(x₀, e). Combining these inequalities, we get d(x, e) < δ + d(x₀, e) ≤ d(x, e) + δ, which implies d(x₀, e) < δ. Therefore, |g(x) - g(x₀)| = |f(e) - f(e)| = 0 < ε.\n\nThus, g is continuous at x₀. Since x₀ ∈ X was arbitrary, g is continuous on X.\n\nFinally, we show that g is an extension of f. Let x ∈ E. Then d(x, x) = 0, so e = x. Hence, g(x) = f(e) = f(x) for all x ∈ E.\n\nIn conclusion, we have constructed a continuous function g: X → [0,1] that extends f, as desired."
