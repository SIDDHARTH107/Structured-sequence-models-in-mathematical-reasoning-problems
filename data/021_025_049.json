    "message_1": "A manufacturing company wants to minimize the cost of producing a certain type of product. The cost of producing each unit depends on the length of a particular component, x cm in length, according to the function C(x) = 100x + 10000/x. However, the length must be between 10 and 30 cm. Use the whale optimization algorithm to find the minimum cost of production and the optimal length of the component.",
    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum of a given function within a specified search space. In this case, we want to find the minimum cost of production (C(x)) and the optimal length of the component (x) within the range of 10 to 30 cm.\n\nTo apply the WOA, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a population of whales (search agents) with random positions within the search space.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each whale (search agent) using the objective function C(x).\n3. Update the position of each whale based on the hunting behavior of humpback whales.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nSince the WOA is a complex algorithm that requires iterative calculations and cannot be easily demonstrated in text format, we will use calculus to find the minimum cost of production and the optimal length of the component.\n\nTo find the minimum cost of production, we need to find the critical points of the function C(x) by taking its derivative with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\nC'(x) = d(100x + 10000/x) / dx\n\nUsing the power rule and the chain rule, we get:\n\nC'(x) = 100 - 10000/x^2\n\nNow, set C'(x) to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = 100 - 10000/x^2\n10000/x^2 = 100\nx^2 = 10000/100\nx^2 = 100\nx = sqrt(100)\nx = 10\n\nSince the optimal length x is within the given range (10 to 30 cm), we can now find the minimum cost of production by plugging x back into the original function C(x):\n\nC(10) = 100(10) + 10000/10\nC(10) = 1000 + 1000\nC(10) = 2000\n\nTherefore, the minimum cost of production is 2000 units, and the optimal length of the component is 10 cm."
