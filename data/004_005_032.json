    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation y' + 4y = 20 with the initial condition y(0) = 2, we will first find the integrating factor and then find the general solution. Finally, we will apply the initial condition to find the particular solution.\n\n1. Find the integrating factor:\nThe integrating factor (IF) is given by the formula IF = e^(∫P(x)dx), where P(x) is the coefficient of y in the given differential equation. In this case, P(x) = 4 (since the equation is y' + 4y = 20).\n\nIF = e^(∫4dx) = e^(4x)\n\n2. Multiply the given differential equation by the integrating factor:\n(e^(4x))(y' + 4y) = (e^(4x))(20)\n\nExpanding, we get:\ne^(4x)y' + 4e^(4x)y = 20e^(4x)\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product of y(x) and the integrating factor e^(4x).\n\n(d/dx)[y(x)e^(4x)] = 20e^(4x)\n\n3. Integrate both sides with respect to x:\n∫(d/dx)[y(x)e^(4x)] dx = ∫20e^(4x) dx\n\nIntegrating, we get:\ny(x)e^(4x) = 5e^(4x) + C\n\n4. Solve for y(x):\ny(x) = e^(-4x)(5e^(4x) + C)\n\nNow, we will apply the initial condition y(0) = 2 to find the particular solution.\n\ny(0) = e^(-4(0))(5e^(4(0)) + C) = 2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n2 = 5 + C\n\nSo, C = -3.\n\nThe particular solution is:\ny(x) = e^(-4x)(5e^(4x) - 3)"
