She also chose her secret key a=47. She wants to send a message M=12 to Bob using ElGamal encryption. Suppose Bob's public key is (h=23, p=61, g=5).\n\na) What is Alice's public key A?\nb) What is the shared key K that is used for encryption?\nc) What is the ciphertext (C1, C2) that Alice sends to Bob?\nd) How can Bob decrypt the received ciphertext to obtain the original message M?\n\n(Note: All calculations should be done modulo 61.)",
    "message_2": "a) To find Alice's public key A, we need to compute A = g^a mod p. In this case, g = 5, a = 47, and p = 61. So:\n\nA = 5^47 mod 61\nA = 54\n\nAlice's public key A is 54.\n\nb) To find the shared key K, we need to compute K = h^a mod p. In this case, h = 23, a = 47, and p = 61. So:\n\nK = 23^47 mod 61\nK = 17\n\nThe shared key K used for encryption is 17.\n\nc) To find the ciphertext (C1, C2) that Alice sends to Bob, we need to choose a random number k (let's say k = 13) and compute:\n\nC1 = g^k mod p\nC1 = 5^13 mod 61\nC1 = 25\n\nC2 = M * K^k mod p\nC2 = 12 * 17^13 mod 61\nC2 = 12 * 49 mod 61\nC2 = 588 mod 61\nC2 = 42\n\nThe ciphertext (C1, C2) that Alice sends to Bob is (25, 42).\n\nd) To decrypt the received ciphertext and obtain the original message M, Bob needs to compute:\n\nM = C2 * (C1^a)^(-1) mod p\nM = 42 * (25^47)^(-1) mod 61\n\nFirst, we need to find the modular inverse of 25^47 mod 61:\n\n25^47 mod 61 = 20\n20 * x mod 61 = 1\n\nBy trying different values for x, we find that x = 50 is the modular inverse:\n\n20 * 50 mod 61 = 1000 mod 61 = 1\n\nNow, we can compute the original message M:\n\nM = 42 * 50 mod 61\nM = 2100 mod 61\nM = 12\n\nBob can decrypt the received ciphertext to obtain the original message M = 12."
