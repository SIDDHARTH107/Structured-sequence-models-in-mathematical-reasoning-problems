    "message_2": "To find the scaling factor of the fern stem after the third iteration, we need to multiply the initial stem height by the shrinking factor for each iteration.\n\nInitial stem height = 1 unit\nShrinking factor = 0.33\n\nAfter the first iteration:\n1 * 0.33 = 0.33\n\nAfter the second iteration:\n0.33 * 0.33 = 0.1089\n\nAfter the third iteration:\n0.1089 * 0.33 â‰ˆ 0.035937\n\nSo, the scaling factor of the fern stem in Barnsley's fern after the third iteration is approximately 0.035937."
