    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A x B and B x A.\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference (A x B) ∆ (B x A).

These two sets are equal, so the statement \"Show that (A x B) ∆ (B x A) is not equal to (B x A) ∆ (A x B)\" is incorrect. In fact, (A x B) ∆ (B x A) is equal to (B x A) ∆ (A x B)."
