    "message_2": "To find the value of y when x = 3 and dy/dx = -2/3, we first need to find the derivative of the given implicit function with respect to x.\n\nGiven equation: x^3 + y^3 = 54\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx(x^3) + d/dx(y^3) = d/dx(54)\n\nUsing the chain rule for the derivative of y^3 with respect to x, we get:\n\n3x^2 + 3y^2(dy/dx) = 0\n\nNow, we are given that dy/dx = -2/3 when x = 3. We can plug these values into the equation:\n\n3(3)^2 + 3y^2(-2/3) = 0\n\n27 - 2y^2 = 0\n\n2y^2 = 27\n\ny^2 = 27/2\n\ny = ±√(27/2)\n\nNow, we need to determine which value of y satisfies the original equation when x = 3:\n\n(3)^3 + y^3 = 54\n\n27 + y^3 = 54\n\ny^3 = 27\n\ny = 3\n\nSo, the value of y is 3 when x = 3 and dy/dx = -2/3."
