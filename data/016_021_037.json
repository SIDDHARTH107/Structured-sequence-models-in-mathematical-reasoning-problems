    "message_2": "The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a fractal that is generated by iteratively replacing each segment of the curve with two segments, each half the length of the original segment, and turning them at a 60-degree angle. After each iteration, the length of the curve increases by a factor of 2/√3.\n\nTo find the length of the curve after the 7th iteration, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2/√3)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1 unit, and we want to find the length after the 7th iteration (n = 7).\n\nLength = 1 * (2/√3)^7\nLength ≈ 1 * 128/√3^7\nLength ≈ 1 * 128/27\nLength ≈ 4.7404\n\nSo, the length of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve after the 7th iteration is approximately 4.7404 units."
