    "message_1": "Suppose you have 4 types of different colored balls. You want to calculate how many ways there are to select a total of 7 balls from these 4 types, if you have unlimited number of each color. How many ways can you do this?",
    "message_2": "This is a problem of combinations with repetitions allowed. We can use the formula:\n\nC(n+r-1, r) = C(n+r-1, n-1)\n\nwhere n is the number of types of balls (4 in this case), r is the total number of balls to be selected (7 in this case), and C(a, b) represents the number of combinations of a things taken b at a time.\n\nSo, we need to calculate C(4+7-1, 7) = C(10, 7) = C(10, 3).\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!) = 10! / (3! * 7!)\n\nC(10, 3) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 10 * 3 * 4 = 120\n\nSo, there are 120 ways to select 7 balls from 4 different colored balls with unlimited supply."
