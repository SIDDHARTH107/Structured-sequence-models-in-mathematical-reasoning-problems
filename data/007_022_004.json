    "message_2": "To find the order of the elliptic curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 3x + 1 over the finite field F_7, we will use the Hasse's theorem. Hasse's theorem states that for an elliptic curve E over a finite field F_q, where q is the size of the field, the number of points N on the curve satisfies the inequality:\n\n|N - (q + 1)| ≤ 2√q\n\nIn our case, q = 7, so we have:\n\n|N - (7 + 1)| ≤ 2√7\n|N - 8| ≤ 5.291\n\nNow, we will find the points on the curve by iterating through all possible x and y values in F_7 and checking if they satisfy the curve equation. If they do, we count them as a point on the curve. We also need to account for the point at infinity, which is always on an elliptic curve.\n\nLet's check all the points:\n\nFor x = 0:\ny^2 = 0^3 + 3*0 + 1 = 1\ny = ±1 (mod 7)\n\nFor x = 1:\ny^2 = 1^3 + 3*1 + 1 = 5\ny = ±2 (mod 7)\n\nFor x = 2:\ny^2 = 2^3 + 3*2 + 1 = 17 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\ny = ±5 (mod 7)\n\nFor x = 3:\ny^2 = 3^3 + 3*3 + 1 = 37 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\ny = ±3 (mod 7)\n\nFor x = 4:\ny^2 = 4^3 + 3*4 + 1 = 73 ≡ 3 (mod 7)\ny = ±5 (mod 7)\n\nFor x = 5:\ny^2 = 5^3 + 3*5 + 1 = 141 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\ny = ±1 (mod 7)\n\nFor x = 6:\ny^2 = 6^3 + 3*6 + 1 = 229 ≡ 5 (mod 7)\ny = ±2 (mod 7)\n\nNow, let's count the points:\n- For each x value, we have 2 points (±y).\n- We have 7 x values, so we have 7 * 2 = 14 points.\n- We also have the point at infinity.\n\nSo, the order of the elliptic curve is 14 + 1 = 15."
