    "message_1": "Suppose there are two gasoline stations in a town that have identical cost structures. Station 1 sets its gas price at $2.50 per gallon, while Station 2 sets its gas price at $2.25 per gallon. According to Bertrand Competition, what is the equilibrium price in this market?",
    "message_2": "According to Bertrand Competition, firms compete on price, and the firm with the lowest price captures the entire market demand. In this case, Station 2 has a lower price at $2.25 per gallon compared to Station 1's price of $2.50 per gallon. Therefore, the equilibrium price in this market would be $2.25 per gallon, as all customers would choose to buy from Station 2."
