    "message_2": "A Sophie Germain prime number is a prime number p such that 2p + 1 is also prime. To find the smallest Sophie Germain prime number greater than p, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the next prime number after p, which we can denote as q.\n2. Check if 2q + 1 is prime.\n3. If 2q + 1 is prime, then q is a Sophie Germain prime number greater than p, and we have found our answer.\n4. If 2q + 1 is not prime, repeat steps 1-3 with the next prime number after q.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python to find the smallest Sophie Germain prime number greater than p:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime, nextprime\n\ndef next_sophie_germain_prime(p):\n    q = nextprime(p)\n    while not isprime(2 * q + 1):\n        q = nextprime(q)\n    return q\n```\n\nNow, you can use this function to find the smallest Sophie Germain prime number greater than any given p. For example, if p = 11 (which is a Sophie Germain prime), the function will return 23, as 23 is the smallest Sophie Germain prime number greater than 11."
