After the first iteration, the fractal is divided into 5 smaller squares. Determine the length of the sides of these smaller squares, and calculate the scaling factor of the fractal after the first iteration.",
    "message_2": "In the Vicsek fractal, after the first iteration, the original square with a side length of 1 unit is divided into 5 smaller squares. These smaller squares form a cross shape, with one square in the center and the other four squares in the corners.\n\nTo determine the length of the sides of these smaller squares, we can observe that the original square is divided into 9 equal parts (3 rows and 3 columns), and the 5 smaller squares occupy 5 of these parts. Since the side length of the original square is 1 unit, the side length of each part is 1/3 units. Therefore, the side length of the smaller squares is also 1/3 units.\n\nThe scaling factor is the ratio of the side length of the smaller squares to the side length of the original square. In this case, the scaling factor is:\n\nScaling factor = (Side length of smaller squares) / (Side length of original square)\nScaling factor = (1/3) / 1\nScaling factor = 1/3\n\nSo, the scaling factor for the Vicsek fractal after the first iteration is 1/3."
