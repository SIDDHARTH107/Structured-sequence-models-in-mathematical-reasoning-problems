    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed by the curves, we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = 2x - 1\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 - 2x + 1 = 0\nx^2 - 5x + 3 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 1 and x = 3. However, since we are only considering the interval [0, 2], we will only use x = 1. \n\nNow, we will find the corresponding y-values for the intersection point:\n\ny = 2(1) - 1 = 1\n\nSo, the point of intersection is (1, 1).\n\nNext, we will find the area enclosed by the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, 2]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 1 - (x^2 - 3x + 2)) dx from 0 to 2\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\nArea = ∫(5x - x^2 - 1) dx from 0 to 2\n\nNow, integrate the function:\n\nArea = [5/2 * x^2 - 1/3 * x^3 - x] evaluated from 0 to 2\n\nPlug in the limits of integration:\n\nArea = (5/2 * (2)^2 - 1/3 * (2)^3 - 2) - (5/2 * (0)^2 - 1/3 * (0)^3 - 0)\nArea = (10 - 8/3 - 2) - 0\nArea = (10 - 6/3 - 6)\nArea = (4 - 2)\nArea = 2\n\nSo, the area enclosed by the curves in the interval [0, 2] is 2 square units."
