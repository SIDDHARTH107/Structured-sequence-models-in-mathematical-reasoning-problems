    "message_2": "To calculate the exterior derivative of $\\omega$, we need to take the differential of each term in the 1-form $\\omega$. Recall that the exterior derivative of a 1-form is a 2-form. \n\nThe exterior derivative of $\\cos(x)dx$ is given by:\n\n$d(\\cos(x)dx) = -\\sin(x)dx \\wedge dx = 0$ (since $dx \\wedge dx = 0$)\n\nThe exterior derivative of $\\sin(y)dy$ is given by:\n\n$d(\\sin(y)dy) = \\cos(y)dy \\wedge dy = 0$ (since $dy \\wedge dy = 0$)\n\nNow, we sum the exterior derivatives of each term:\n\n$d\\omega = d(\\cos(x)dx) + d(\\sin(y)dy) = 0 + 0 = 0$\n\nTherefore, the exterior derivative of $\\omega$ is 0."
