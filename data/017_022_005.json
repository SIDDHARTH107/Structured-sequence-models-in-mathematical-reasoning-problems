    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 60, we will use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5. \n\nLet G be a group of order 60. By the Sylow theorems, we have:\n\n1. The number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 3 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1, 3, or 15.\n2. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 2^2 * 5 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 10.\n3. The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 2^2 * 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, n_5 can be 1 or 6.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_2 = n_3 = n_5 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, and a unique Sylow 5-subgroup. In this case, G is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and G is isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_3 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_60. This is the cyclic group of order 60.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4, and n_5 = 6, then G has 3 Sylow 2-subgroups, 4 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups. In this case, G is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_5, which has order 60.\n\n3. If n_2 = 15, n_3 = 10, and n_5 = 6, then G has 15 Sylow 2-subgroups, 10 Sylow 3-subgroups, and 6 Sylow 5-subgroups. In this case, G is isomorphic to the alternating group A_5, which has order 60.\n\nThese are the only possible combinations of Sylow subgroups for a group of order 60. Therefore, there are 3 non-isomorphic groups of order 60:\n\n1. The cyclic group Z_60 (isomorphism class: C60)\n2. The symmetric group S_5 (isomorphism class: S5)\n3. The alternating group A_5 (isomorphism class: A5)"
