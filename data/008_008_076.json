    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products, Product A and Product B. The production of Product A requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of handwork, while the production of Product B requires 2 hours of machine time and 4 hours of handwork. The company has 60 hours of machine time and 48 hours of handwork available each week. Product A earns a profit of $5 per unit and Product B earns a profit of $8 per unit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for machine time and handwork are given by the following inequalities:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 60 (machine time constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 48 (handwork constraint)\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 8y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 60\n2y ≤ -3x + 60\ny ≤ -1.5x + 30\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 48\n4y ≤ -2x + 48\ny ≤ -0.5x + 12\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the points where the lines intersect:\n\n(0, 0) - intersection of y-axis and x-axis\n(0, 12) - intersection of y-axis and y ≤ -0.5x + 12\n(20, 0) - intersection of x-axis and y ≤ -1.5x + 30\n(8, 10) - intersection of y ≤ -1.5x + 30 and y ≤ -0.5x + 12\n\nNow we need to evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0\nP(0, 12) = 5(0) + 8(12) = 96\nP(20, 0) = 5(20) + 8(0) = 100\nP(8, 10) = 5(8) + 8(10) = 40 + 80 = 120\n\nThe maximum profit is $120, which occurs when the company produces 8 units of Product A and 10 units of Product B."
