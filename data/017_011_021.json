    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 12 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6, we will consider the possible structures of G based on the Sylow theorems.\n\nLet G be a group of order 12. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 4.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 3. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, P_2 ∩ P_3 = {e}, where e is the identity element. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P_2 and P_3, which is a cyclic group of order 12. Thus, G is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 3, which is normal in G. Let P_2 be one of the three 2-Sylow subgroups of order 4. Since P_2 is not normal in G, there exists an element g ∈ G such that gP_2g^(-1) ≠ P_2. Let H = <P_2, g>. Then, the order of H is a multiple of 4, and since |G| = 12, we have |H| = 12. Thus, G = H.\n\nNow, consider the action of g on P_2 by conjugation. Since gP_2g^(-1) ≠ P_2, the action is nontrivial. This action partitions P_2 into orbits. The only possible orbit sizes are 1 and 4. Since the identity element e is always in an orbit of size 1, there must be another element in an orbit of size 1. This implies that g^2 ∈ P_2. Therefore, G is generated by two elements a and b, where a has order 3, b has order 4, and b^(-1)ab = a^(-1). This is precisely the presentation of the dihedral group D6. Thus, G is isomorphic to D6.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4, which is normal in G. Let P_3 be one of the four 3-Sylow subgroups of order 3. Since P_3 is not normal in G, there exists an element g ∈ G such that gP_3g^(-1) ≠ P_3. Let H = <P_3, g>. Then, the order of H is a multiple of 3, and since |G| = 12, we have |H| = 12. Thus, G = H.\n\nNow, consider the action of g on P_3 by conjugation. Since gP_3g^(-1) ≠ P_3, the action is nontrivial. This action partitions P_3 into orbits. The only possible orbit sizes are 1 and 3. Since the identity element e is always in an orbit of size 1, there must be another element in an orbit of size 1. This implies that g^3 ∈ P_3. Therefore, G is generated by two elements a and b, where a has order 2, b has order 3, and b^(-1)ab = a^(-1). This is precisely the presentation of the alternating group A4. Thus, G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nIn conclusion, a group G of order 12 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C12, the alternating group A4, or the dihedral group D6."
