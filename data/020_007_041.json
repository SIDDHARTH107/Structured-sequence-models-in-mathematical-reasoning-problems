    "message_1": "Consider a team of 5 students who are going to participate in a Math Olympiad competition. If they have to select 4 questions out of 10 different questions, how many different ways can they choose the questions to attempt? Use combinatorial optimization to find the optimal solution.",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different ways the team can choose 4 questions out of 10, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items, n! is the factorial of n, and k! is the factorial of k.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (the total number of questions) and k = 4 (the number of questions the team needs to choose).\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n\nC(10, 4) = 10! / (4!6!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\n6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the combination formula:\n\nC(10, 4) = 3,628,800 / (24 × 720)\n\nC(10, 4) = 3,628,800 / 17,280\n\nC(10, 4) = 210\n\nSo, there are 210 different ways the team can choose 4 questions out of 10 to attempt in the Math Olympiad competition."
