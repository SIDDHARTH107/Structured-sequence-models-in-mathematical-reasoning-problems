    "message_1": "What is the probability of correctly guessing a message encrypted using the Caesar cipher, assuming the attacker does not know the key and is trying random shifts? Assume the message contains 20 uppercase letters and the key used is a random integer between 1 and 25.",
    "message_2": "The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions (the key). Since there are 26 uppercase letters in the alphabet and the key can be any integer between 1 and 25, there are 25 possible shifts (excluding the shift by 0, which would result in the original message).\n\nIf the attacker is trying random shifts, they have a 1 in 25 chance of guessing the correct key. The probability of correctly guessing the message encrypted using the Caesar cipher is therefore 1/25 or 0.04 (4%). The length of the message (20 uppercase letters in this case) does not affect the probability, as the attacker only needs to guess the correct key to decrypt the entire message."
