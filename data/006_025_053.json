    "message_1": "A magician has 5 red balls and 4 green balls in a bag. If she randomly selects 2 balls without replacement, what is the probability that both balls are green?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of both balls being green, we can use the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)\n\nIn this case, event A is selecting the first green ball, and event B is selecting the second green ball given that the first one was green.\n\n1. Probability of selecting the first green ball (event A):\nThere are 4 green balls and a total of 9 balls (5 red + 4 green), so the probability of selecting a green ball first is:\n\nP(A) = 4/9\n\n2. Probability of selecting the second green ball given that the first one was green (event B|A):\nSince we have already selected one green ball, there are now 3 green balls left and a total of 8 balls (5 red + 3 green). So the probability of selecting a green ball again is:\n\nP(B|A) = 3/8\n\nNow, we can find the probability of both events A and B happening:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = (4/9) * (3/8) = 12/72\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n12/72 = 1/6\n\nSo the probability of selecting two green balls without replacement is 1/6 or approximately 0.1667."
