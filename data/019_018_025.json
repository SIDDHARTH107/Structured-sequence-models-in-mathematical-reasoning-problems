Here's the step-by-step proof:\n\n1. (Q ∨ R) ∧ ¬Q (Premise)\n2. Q ∨ R (1, ∧-Elimination)\n3. ¬Q (1, ∧-Elimination)\n4. R (2, 3, Disjunction Elimination)\n   4.1 Q (Assumption)\n   4.2 ⊥ (3, 4.1, ¬-Elimination)\n   4.3 R (4.2, ⊥-Elimination)\n5. R (2, 3, Disjunction Elimination)\n   5.1 R (Assumption)\n6.
