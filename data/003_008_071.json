    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle using trigonometry, we can first find the angles of the triangle and then use the sine formula for the area of a triangle. \n\nStep 1: Find the angles of the triangle\nSince we have the base (b) and the height (h) of the triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse (c). \n\nb^2 + h^2 = c^2\n8^2 + 12^2 = c^2\n64 + 144 = c^2\n208 = c^2\nc = √208 ≈ 14.42 cm\n\nNow, we can find the angles of the triangle using the sine, cosine, or tangent functions. Let's use the sine function.\n\nsin(A) = opposite/hypotenuse\nsin(A) = h/c\nsin(A) = 12/14.42\nA ≈ sin^(-1)(12/14.42) ≈ 56.44°\n\nNow, we can find the second angle (B) by subtracting the first angle from 90°, since it's a right-angled triangle.\n\nB = 90° - A\nB = 90° - 56.44°\nB ≈ 33.56°\n\nStep 2: Find the area using the sine formula\nThe sine formula for the area of a triangle is:\n\nArea = (1/2)ab * sin(C)\n\nIn our case, C is the right angle (90°), and sin(90°) = 1. So, the formula simplifies to:\n\nArea = (1/2)ab\n\nWe already have the values for a and b (base and height):\n\nArea = (1/2)(8)(12)\nArea = 48 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 48 cm²."
