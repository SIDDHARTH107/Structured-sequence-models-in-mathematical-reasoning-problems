    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 10 cm and a height of 8 cm. What is the area of the triangle using the trigonometry formula?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle using trigonometry, we need to know two sides and the included angle. However, in this problem, we are given the base and height, which is enough to find the area using the standard formula for the area of a triangle:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 10 cm * 8 cm = 40 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 40 cm²."
