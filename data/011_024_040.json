    "message_1": "A factory produces 600 units of a product each day. There are two distribution centers, A and B, that the factory can send the products to. Center A can receive up to 400 units per day, while center B can receive up to 300 units per day. How many units should the factory send to each center to maximize the total amount of products distributed?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the total amount of products distributed, the factory should send as many units as possible to each center without exceeding their capacity. \n\nCenter A can receive up to 400 units per day, so the factory should send 400 units to center A. \n\nCenter B can receive up to 300 units per day. Since the factory produces 600 units per day, and 400 units are already sent to center A, there are 200 units left to send to center B. \n\nTherefore, the factory should send 400 units to center A and 200 units to center B to maximize the total amount of products distributed."
