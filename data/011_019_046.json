    "message_2": "An orthogonal array OA(n, k) is an n Ã— k array with the property that, in any two columns, each of the possible ordered pairs of symbols occurs the same number of times. In this case, we have a 5-factor, 3-level orthogonal array, denoted by OA(5, 3).\n\nFor a 3-level orthogonal array, the number of runs (rows) is equal to the smallest power of 3 that is greater than or equal to the number of factors. In this case, the number of factors is 5. The smallest power of 3 that is greater than or equal to 5 is 3^2 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the (5, 3) orthogonal array has 9 runs (rows)."
