    "message_1": "In a Public Goods Game, there are 5 players who each have $100. Each player can choose to either keep their money or contribute it to a common pool. The total amount in the pool is then multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and split evenly among all players, regardless of whether they contributed or not. If all players contribute equally to the pool, what is the maximum payout each player can receive?",
    "message_2": "If all players contribute equally to the pool, each player will contribute $100. Since there are 5 players, the total amount in the pool will be 5 * $100 = $500.\n\nThe total amount in the pool is then multiplied by a factor of 1.5: $500 * 1.5 = $750.\n\nSince the $750 is split evenly among all 5 players, regardless of whether they contributed or not, each player will receive: $750 / 5 = $150.\n\nSo, the maximum payout each player can receive if all players contribute equally to the pool is $150."
