    "message_2": "To find the median, first quartile, and third quartile using Tukey's Five-Number Summary method, we first need to order the data from smallest to largest, which is already done in this case:\n\n{65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 75, 81, 85, 95}\n\nNext, we find the median (Q2), which is the middle value of the dataset. Since there are 10 measurements, we take the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th):\n\nMedian (Q2) = (71 + 72) / 2 = 71.5\n\nNow, we find the first quartile (Q1), which is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding the median if the dataset has an odd number of values). In this case, the lower half of the data is:\n\n{65, 67, 69, 70, 71}\n\nSince there are 5 values, the first quartile (Q1) is the middle value:\n\nFirst Quartile (Q1) = 69\n\nNext, we find the third quartile (Q3), which is the median of the upper half of the data (excluding the median if the dataset has an odd number of values). In this case, the upper half of the data is:\n\n{72, 75, 81, 85, 95}\n\nSince there are 5 values, the third quartile (Q3) is the middle value:\n\nThird Quartile (Q3) = 81\n\nSo, the median is 71.5, the first quartile is 69, and the third quartile is 81."
