    "message_2": "To find the image of the straight line segment joining 1 and 2i under the conformal map w(z) = z + 1/z, we need to find the images of the endpoints 1 and 2i under this map and then determine the curve that connects these two images.\n\nFirst, let's find the image of the point z = 1 under the map w(z):\n\nw(1) = 1 + 1/1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nNow, let's find the image of the point z = 2i under the map w(z):\n\nw(2i) = 2i + 1/(2i) = 2i - i/2 = (3/2)i\n\nNow we have the images of the endpoints, w(1) = 2 and w(2i) = (3/2)i. To find the curve that connects these two points, we can parameterize the line segment joining 1 and 2i in the z-plane and then apply the conformal map w(z).\n\nLet's parameterize the line segment as follows:\n\nz(t) = (1-t)(1) + t(2i) = 1 + t(2i-1), where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1\n\nNow, we can apply the conformal map w(z) to this parameterization:\n\nw(z(t)) = w(1 + t(2i-1)) = (1 + t(2i-1)) + 1/(1 + t(2i-1))\n\nTo simplify this expression, let's find the reciprocal of (1 + t(2i-1)):\n\n1/(1 + t(2i-1)) = (1 - t(2i-1))/((1 + t(2i-1))(1 - t(2i-1))) = (1 - t(2i-1))/(1 + t^2(1-2i))\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the expression for w(z(t)):\n\nw(z(t)) = (1 + t(2i-1)) + (1 - t(2i-1))/(1 + t^2(1-2i))\n\nw(z(t)) = (1 + t(2i-1)) + (1 - t(2i-1) - t^2(2i-1))/(1 + t^2(1-2i))\n\nw(z(t)) = (1 + t(2i-1)) - (t^2(2i-1))/(1 + t^2(1-2i))\n\nThis expression represents the curve in the w-plane that connects the images of the endpoints 1 and 2i under the conformal map w(z) = z + 1/z. The curve is a portion of a circle that connects the points w(1) = 2 and w(2i) = (3/2)i in the w-plane."
