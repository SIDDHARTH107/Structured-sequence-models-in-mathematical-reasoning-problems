    "message_2": "To find the expected number of customers that will make a purchase, you can multiply the total number of potential customers by the probability of a customer making a purchase.\n\nExpected number of customers making a purchase = Total potential customers × Probability of making a purchase\n\nExpected number of customers making a purchase = 1000 × 0.2\n\nExpected number of customers making a purchase = 200\n\nSo, the expected number of customers that will make a purchase is 200."
