    "message_1": "A trapezoid has a length of 6 cm and a height of 4 cm. The length of the two parallel sides are 10 cm and 8 cm respectively. Find the area of the trapezoid.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a trapezoid, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides) * height\n\nIn this case, the sum of the lengths of the parallel sides is 10 cm + 8 cm = 18 cm. The height is given as 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (18 cm) * (4 cm)\n\nArea = 9 cm * 4 cm\n\nArea = 36 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the trapezoid is 36 square centimeters."
