Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the average rate of change of bromate concentration between 0 and 50 seconds, we will use the formula:\n\nAverage rate of change = (Change in concentration) / (Change in time)\n\nFrom the data given, at t = 0 seconds, [BrO3] = 0.08 M, and at t = 50 seconds, [BrO3] = 0.12 M.\n\nChange in concentration = Final concentration - Initial concentration\nChange in concentration = 0.12 M - 0.08 M = 0.04 M\n\nChange in time = 50 seconds - 0 seconds = 50 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the average rate of change:\n\nAverage rate of change = (0.04 M) / (50 s)\nAverage rate of change = 0.0008 M/s\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the average rate of change of bromate concentration between 0 and 50 seconds is 0.00 M/s."
