    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27 with elements a and b, where a has order 3 and b has order 9. We want to show that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nFirst, note that since the order of G is 27, which is a power of a prime (3^3), G is a p-group. By the Sylow theorems, every p-group has a non-trivial center. Let Z(G) be the center of G. Since the order of Z(G) must divide the order of G, the possible orders for Z(G) are 1, 3, 9, or 27. If the order of Z(G) is 27, then G is abelian, which contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian. If the order of Z(G) is 1, then G has a trivial center, which contradicts the fact that every p-group has a non-trivial center.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where the order of Z(G) is 3 or 9.\n\nCase 1: |Z(G)| = 3\nIn this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 9. Since 9 is a power of a prime, G/Z(G) is also a p-group and must have a non-trivial center. The only possible non-trivial center for G/Z(G) is a subgroup of order 3, which corresponds to a normal subgroup N of G with |N| = 9. Since b has order 9, we can assume that N = ⟨b⟩.\n\nNow, let H = ⟨a⟩. Since |H| = 3 and |N| = 9, we have |HN| = |H||N|/|H ∩ N| = 27, and H ∩ N = {e} (since a has order 3 and b has order 9, their orders are coprime). Thus, G = HN, and H and N are both normal subgroups of G.\n\nNow, consider the element c = ab. Since a and b are in different subgroups, we have c ≠ a^i * b^j for any i, j ≠ 0. Thus, c has order 9 (since it cannot have order 1 or 3). Now, we can write any element of G as a^i * b^j * c^k for some i, j, k. Since a, b, and c all have orders that are powers of 3, G is a group of exponent 3^2 = 9.\n\nNow, we can define a homomorphism φ: G → H ⊗ N by φ(a^i * b^j * c^k) = (a^i, b^j * c^k). Since G is generated by a and b, and φ(a) = (a, e) and φ(b) = (e, b), φ is an isomorphism. Thus, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nCase 2: |Z(G)| = 9\nIn this case, G/Z(G) is a group of order 3, which is cyclic and therefore abelian. This contradicts our assumption that G is non-abelian.\n\nTherefore, the only possible case is that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27 when the order of Z(G) is 3."
