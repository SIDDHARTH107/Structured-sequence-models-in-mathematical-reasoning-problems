    "message_1": "A store sold 100 shirts in a month, and the store's owner estimated that 60 shirts were \"high-quality\", 20 were of \"medium-quality\", and 20 were \"low-quality\". Using fuzzy logic, what is the degree of membership of each shirt in quality categories \"high-quality\", \"medium-quality\", and \"low-quality\"?",
    "message_2": "In fuzzy logic, the degree of membership of an element in a set can range from 0 to 1. In this case, we have 100 shirts and three quality categories: high-quality, medium-quality, and low-quality. The store owner's estimation of the number of shirts in each category can be used to determine the degree of membership for each shirt in each category.\n\nTo find the degree of membership for each shirt in each quality category, we can divide the number of shirts in each category by the total number of shirts (100).\n\nDegree of membership in high-quality category:\n60 high-quality shirts / 100 total shirts = 0.6\n\nDegree of membership in medium-quality category:\n20 medium-quality shirts / 100 total shirts = 0.2\n\nDegree of membership in low-quality category:\n20 low-quality shirts / 100 total shirts = 0.2\n\nSo, the degree of membership for each shirt in the high-quality, medium-quality, and low-quality categories are 0.6, 0.2, and 0.2, respectively."
