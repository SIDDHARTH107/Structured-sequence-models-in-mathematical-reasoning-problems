    "message_1": "What is the value of the Feigenbaum constant δ in the logistic map function f(x) = 4x(1-x) for a period-doubling cascade from 2 to 4? Round your answer to four decimal places.",
    "message_2": "The Feigenbaum constant δ is a universal constant that appears in the study of bifurcations and chaos in dynamical systems, such as the logistic map function f(x) = 4x(1-x). It is defined as the limiting ratio of consecutive period-doubling bifurcation intervals.\n\nThe value of the Feigenbaum constant δ is approximately 4.6692. This value is independent of the specific logistic map function and holds for period-doubling cascades in various dynamical systems."
