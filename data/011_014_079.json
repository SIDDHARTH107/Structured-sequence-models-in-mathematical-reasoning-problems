    "message_2": "To find the number of edges in the graph, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this graph, there are 8 vertices, each with a degree of 3. So, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 8 * 3 = 24.\n\nAccording to the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to 2 * the number of edges. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n24 = 2 * number of edges\n\nNow, we can solve for the number of edges:\n\nnumber of edges = 24 / 2 = 12\n\nSo, there are 12 edges in the graph."
