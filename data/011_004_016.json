    "message_1": "Suppose that you have 6 different objects, and you want to divide them into 3 groups consisting of 2 objects each. How many different ways can you do this?",
    "message_2": "To divide the 6 different objects into 3 groups of 2 objects each, we can use the concept of combinations.\n\nFirst, we choose 2 objects out of 6 for the first group. The number of ways to do this is C(6,2) = 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = 15.\n\nNext, we choose 2 objects out of the remaining 4 for the second group. The number of ways to do this is C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6.\n\nFinally, the last 2 objects will automatically form the third group.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to form each group: 15 * 6 = 90. However, since the groups are indistinguishable, we have overcounted the arrangements. We need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 3 groups, which is 3! = 6.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 / 6 = 15 different ways to divide the 6 objects into 3 groups of 2 objects each."
