    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in a year)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials\n- p is the probability of success (rainy day)\n- n is the number of trials (days in a year)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days)\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- n = 365 (days in a year)\n- k = 100 (rainy days)\n- p = 0.35 (probability of a rainy day)\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCk (365 choose 100):\n\nnCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere ! denotes the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1).\n\nnCk = 365! / (100!(365-100)!)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 100) = (365C100) * (0.35^100) * (1-0.35)^(365-100)\n\nP(X = 100) = (365C100) * (0.35^100) * (0.65^265)\n\nCalculating this probability using a calculator or software:\n\nP(X = 100) â‰ˆ 0.0273\n\nSo, the probability that it will rain on exactly 100 days in the next year in that region is approximately 2.73%."
