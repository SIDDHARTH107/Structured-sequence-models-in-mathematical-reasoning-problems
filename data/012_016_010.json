    "message_2": "The Tutte polynomial, also known as the Tutte–Whitney polynomial, is a polynomial associated with an undirected graph. It is defined as T(x, y) = ∑(r, k) A(r, k) x^(r - k) y^(k - c), where the sum is taken over all subgraphs of the given graph, r is the number of connected components, k is the number of edges, and c is the number of vertices in the subgraph.\n\nFor the given graph, let's label the edges as follows:\n\n```\nA --1-- B\n|      | \n4      2\n|      | \nC --3-- D\n```\n\nNow, we will compute the Tutte polynomial by considering all possible subgraphs:\n\n1. No edges: T(0, 0) = x^(4 - 0) y^(0 - 4) = x^4 y^(-4)\n2. One edge: T(1, 1) = x^(3 - 1) y^(1 - 4) = x^2 y^(-3)\n3. Two edges without a cycle: T(2, 2) = x^(2 - 2) y^(2 - 4) = x^0 y^(-2)\n4. Two edges with a cycle: T(1, 2) = x^(3 - 2) y^(2 - 4) = x^1 y^(-2)\n5. Three edges without a cycle: T(3, 3) = x^(1 - 3) y^(3 - 4) = x^(-2) y^(-1)\n6. Three edges with a cycle: T(2, 3) = x^(2 - 3) y^(3 - 4) = x^(-1) y^(-1)\n7. Four edges (the entire graph): T(1, 4) = x^(3 - 4) y^(4 - 4) = x^(-1) y^0\n\nNow, we sum up the contributions from all subgraphs:\n\nT(x, y) = x^4 y^(-4) + 4x^2 y^(-3) + 6x^0 y^(-2) + 4x^1 y^(-2) + 4x^(-2) y^(-1) + 4x^(-1) y^(-1) + x^(-1) y^0\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nT(x, y) = x^4 y^(-4) + 4x^2 y^(-3) + 6x^0 y^(-2) + 4x^1 y^(-2) + 4x^(-2) y^(-1) + 4x^(-1) y^(-1) + x^(-1) y^0"
