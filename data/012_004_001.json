    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm, we'll start with an arbitrary vertex and then iteratively add the shortest edge that connects a new vertex to the existing tree. We'll keep track of the visited cities and the edges that form the minimum spanning tree.\n\n1. Start with City 1. Mark City 1 as visited.\n   Visited cities: {City 1}\n   Minimum spanning tree edges: {}\n\n2. The shortest edge from City 1 is to City 3 with a distance of 2.\n   Visited cities: {City 1, City 3}\n   Minimum spanning tree edges: {(City 1, City 3)}\n\n3. The shortest edge from the visited cities is from City 3 to City 2 with a distance of 3.\n   Visited cities: {City 1, City 2, City 3}\n   Minimum spanning tree edges: {(City 1, City 3), (City 3, City 2)}\n\n4. The shortest edge from the visited cities is from City 3 to City 4 with a distance of 5.\n   Visited cities: {City 1, City 2, City 3, City 4}\n   Minimum spanning tree edges: {(City 1, City 3), (City 3, City 2), (City 3, City 4)}\n\n5. The shortest edge from the visited cities is from City 4 to City 5 with a distance of 2.\n   Visited cities: {City 1, City 2, City 3, City 4, City 5}\n   Minimum spanning tree edges: {(City 1, City 3), (City 3, City 2), (City 3, City 4), (City 4, City 5)}\n\n6.
