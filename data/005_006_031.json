    "message_2": "To find the probability that the average weight of the sample is between 145g and 155g, we need to use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nIn this case, the population mean (μ) is 150g, and the population standard deviation (σ) is 20g. The sample size (n) is 64.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean, which is given by the formula:\n\nσ_sample_mean = σ / √n\n\nσ_sample_mean = 20g / √64 = 20g / 8 = 2.5g\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for the given range of average weights (145g and 155g). The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nFor 145g:\n\nz1 = (145 - 150) / 2.5 = -5 / 2.5 = -2\n\nFor 155g:\n\nz2 = (155 - 150) / 2.5 = 5 / 2.5 = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score lies between -2 and 2. We can use a z-table or a calculator to find the area under the standard normal curve between these z-scores.\n\nP(-2 < z < 2) = P(z < 2) - P(z < -2)\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find:\n\nP(z < 2) ≈ 0.9772\nP(z < -2) ≈ 0.0228\n\nP(-2 < z < 2) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of the sample is between 145g and 155g is approximately 95.44%."
