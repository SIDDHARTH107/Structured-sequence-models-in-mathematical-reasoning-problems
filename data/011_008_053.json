    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stars and bars. Since no box can be empty, we can first place one ball in each of the 5 boxes. Now we have 5 balls left to distribute among the 5 boxes.\n\nWe can think of the remaining balls as stars, and we need to place 4 bars between them to separate the balls into 5 groups (corresponding to the 5 boxes). So we have a total of 9 positions (5 balls and 4 bars) and we need to choose 4 of them to place the bars.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n = 9 and k = 4 in this case.\n\nC(9, 4) = 9! / (4! * (9-4)!)\n= 9! / (4! * 5!)\n= (9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5!) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 5!)\n= (9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 3024 / 24\n= 126\n\nSo there are 126 ways to distribute the 10 identical balls among the 5 distinct boxes such that no box is empty."
