    "message_2": "To approximate the solution of the given ODE using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h=0.1, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the function for the ODE.\n2. Implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.\n3. Iterate through the method until t=200.\n\nFirst, let's define the function for the ODE:\n\n```python\ndef mackey_glass(t, y, y_delayed):\n    return 0.2 * y_delayed / (1 + y_delayed**10) - 0.1 * y\n```\n\nNow, let's implement the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method:\n\n```python\ndef runge_kutta_4th_order(t, y, h, y_delayed):\n    k1 = h * mackey_glass(t, y, y_delayed)\n    k2 = h * mackey_glass(t + h/2, y + k1/2, y_delayed)\n    k3 = h * mackey_glass(t + h/2, y + k2/2, y_delayed)\n    k4 = h * mackey_glass(t + h, y + k3, y_delayed)\n    \n    return y + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n```\n\nFinally, let's iterate through the method until t=200:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nt = 0\ny = 1.2\nh = 0.1\nt_end = 200\ndelay = 17.5\n\n# Initialize the history of y values for the delay\ny_history = [y] * int(delay / h)\n\nwhile t < t_end:\n    y_delayed = y_history.pop(0)\n    y = runge_kutta_4th_order(t, y, h, y_delayed)\n    y_history.append(y)\n    t += h\n\nprint(\"y(200) â‰ˆ\", y)\n```\n\nThis code will output an approximation for y(200) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h=0.1. Note that the accuracy of the approximation depends on the step size and the specific problem."
