    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator $\\star$ for the differential form $\\omega = dx \\wedge dy$ at the point $(1,2)$ in $M$, we first need to find the volume form $\\text{vol}_g$ associated with the Riemannian metric $g$. The volume form is given by:\n\n$\\text{vol}_g = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} dx \\wedge dy$\n\nwhere $\\det(g)$ is the determinant of the metric tensor $g$. In our case, the metric tensor is given by:\n\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe determinant of $g$ is:\n\n$\\det(g) = (1)(4) - (0)(0) = 4$\n\nSo the volume form is:\n\n$\\text{vol}_g = \\sqrt{4} dx \\wedge dy = 2 dx \\wedge dy$\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge star operator $\\star$ for the differential form $\\omega = dx \\wedge dy$ at the point $(1,2)$ in $M$. The Hodge star operator is defined as:\n\n$\\star \\omega = \\frac{\\omega}{\\text{vol}_g}$\n\nIn our case, this gives:\n\n$\\star \\omega = \\frac{dx \\wedge dy}{2 dx \\wedge dy} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo the Hodge star operator $\\star$ for the differential form $\\omega = dx \\wedge dy$ at the point $(1,2)$ in $M$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$."
