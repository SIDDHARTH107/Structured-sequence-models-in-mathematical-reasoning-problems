    "message_2": "Player A has a winning strategy.\n\nHere's the strategy for player A:\n\n1. On the first turn, player A removes the middle stone (the 3rd stone). Now there are two separate groups of stones: one group with two stones on the left (1st and 2nd stones) and another group with two stones on the right (4th and 5th stones).\n\n2. From this point on, player A mirrors player B's moves in the opposite group of stones. For example, if player B removes one stone from the left group, player A removes one stone from the right group. If player B removes two stones from the left group, player A removes two stones from the right group.\n\nBy following this strategy, player A ensures that they will always remove the last stone and win the game."
