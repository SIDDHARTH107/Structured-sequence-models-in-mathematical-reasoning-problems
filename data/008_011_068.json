    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we first need to find the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D), and then the determinants of the matrices obtained by replacing the columns of the coefficient matrix with the constants (Dx, Dy, Dz). Finally, we will find the values of x, y, and z by dividing Dx, Dy, and Dz by D.\n\nThe coefficient matrix is:\n| 2  1 -3 |\n| 3 -2  4 |\n| 1  5 -2 |\n\nTo find the determinant D:\nD = 2((-2)(-2) - (4)(5)) - 1((3)(-2) - (4)(1)) - 3((3)(5) - (-2)(1))\nD = 2(4 - 20) - 1(-6 - 4) - 3(15 + 2)\nD = 2(-16) + 1(10) - 3(17)\nD = -32 + 10 - 51\nD = -73\n\nNow, let's find Dx by replacing the first column of the coefficient matrix with the constants:\n| 1  1 -3 |\n| 9 -2  4 |\n| 3  5 -2 |\n\nDx = 1((-2)(-2) - (4)(5)) - 1((9)(-2) - (4)(3)) - 3((9)(5) - (-2)(3))\nDx = 1(4 - 20) - 1(-18 - 12) - 3(45 + 6)\nDx = 1(-16) + 1(30) - 3(51)\nDx = -16 + 30 - 153\nDx = -139\n\nNow, let's find Dy by replacing the second column of the coefficient matrix with the constants:\n| 2  1 -3 |\n| 3  9  4 |\n| 1  3 -2 |\n\nDy = 2((9)(-2) - (4)(3)) - 1((3)(-2) - (4)(1)) + 3((3)(3) - (9)(1))\nDy = 2(-18 - 12) - 1(-6 - 4) + 3(9 - 9)\nDy = 2(-30) + 1(10) + 3(0)\nDy = -60 + 10\nDy = -50\n\nFinally, let's find Dz by replacing the third column of the coefficient matrix with the constants:\n| 2  1  1 |\n| 3 -2  9 |\n| 1  5  3 |\n\nDz = 2((-2)(3) - (9)(5)) - 1((3)(3) - (9)(1)) + 1((3)(5) - (-2)(1))\nDz = 2(-6 - 45) - 1(9 - 9) + 1(15 + 2)\nDz = 2(-51) + 0 + 1(17)\nDz = -102 + 17\nDz = -85\n\nNow, we can find the values of x, y, and z by dividing Dx, Dy, and Dz by D:\nx = Dx / D = -139 / -73 = 1.9041 (approximately)\ny = Dy / D = -50 / -73 = 0.6849 (approximately)\nz = Dz / D = -85 / -73 = 1.1644 (approximately)\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is approximately:\nx ≈ 1.9041\ny ≈ 0.6849\nz ≈ 1.1644"
