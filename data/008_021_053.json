    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the method of inverse matrices, we first need to write the given system in the matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nThe given system can be written as:\n\nA = | 1  2 -1 |\n    | 2  4 -2 |\n    | 1  2 -2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = |  5  |\n    | 10  |\n    |  7  |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A, denoted as A^(-1). To do this, we first need to find the determinant of A.\n\ndet(A) = | 1  2 -1 | = 1*(8 - 4) - 2*(4 - 2) + (-1)*(4 - 2)\n         | 2  4 -2 |         = 1*4 - 2*2 + (-1)*2\n         | 1  2 -2 |         = 4 - 4 - 2\n                              = -2\n\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse of A exists. Now, let's find the inverse of A using the formula A^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nadj(A) = |  8  -4  4 |\n         | -4   2 -2 |\n         |  4  -2  2 |\n\nNow, multiply the adjugate of A by (1/det(A)):\n\nA^(-1) = (1/-2) * adj(A) = | -4   2 -2 |\n                            |  2  -1  1 |\n                            | -2   1 -1 |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B = | -4  2 -2 | * |  5  | = | 1 |\n                 |  2 -1  1 |   | 10  |   | 2 |\n                 | -2  1 -1 |   |  7  |   | 3 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 3."
