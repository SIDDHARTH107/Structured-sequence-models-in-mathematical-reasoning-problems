    "message_1": "You are playing a Public Goods Game with three other players. Each player is given 10 tokens and can choose to either keep them or contribute them to a common pool. The tokens in the pool will be multiplied by a factor of 1.8 and then distributed evenly among all players, including those who did not contribute. \n\nAssuming that all players are rational selfish actors and will only contribute if it benefits them, what is the maximum number of tokens you should contribute to the common pool to maximize your own payoff?",
    "message_2": "As a rational selfish actor, you will only contribute tokens to the common pool if it benefits you. Let's analyze the payoff for contributing x tokens to the common pool.\n\nIf you contribute x tokens, you will have (10 - x) tokens left. The total tokens in the common pool will be multiplied by 1.8, and then divided by 4 (since there are 4 players). So, your share of the common pool will be (1.8x)/4.\n\nYour total payoff will be the sum of the tokens you kept and your share of the common pool: (10 - x) + (1.8x)/4.\n\nTo maximize your payoff, we need to find the value of x that maximizes this expression. Taking the derivative with respect to x and setting it to zero:\n\nd(Payoff)/dx = -1 + (1.8/4) = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 20/9 â‰ˆ 2.22\n\nSince you can only contribute whole tokens, you should contribute either 2 or 3 tokens to maximize your payoff. However, if all players are rational selfish actors, they will also contribute 2 or 3 tokens. In this case, contributing 2 tokens will give you a slightly higher payoff than contributing 3 tokens.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of tokens you should contribute to the common pool to maximize your own payoff is 2 tokens."
