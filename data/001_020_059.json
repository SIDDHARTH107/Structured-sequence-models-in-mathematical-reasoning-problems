    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x. So, we have:\n\n0 = |2x + 6| - 3\n\nNow, we need to isolate the absolute value expression:\n\n3 = |2x + 6|\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero:\n\n2x + 6 = 3\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x = -3\nx = -3/2\n\nCase 2: The expression inside the absolute value is negative:\n\n-(2x + 6) = 3\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n-2x - 6 = 3\n-2x = 9\nx = -9/2\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = -3/2 and x = -9/2."
