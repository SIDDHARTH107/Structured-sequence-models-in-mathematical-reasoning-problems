    "message_2": "First, let's find A △ B, which is the symmetric difference between sets A and B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA △ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's calculate (A △ B) △ A and A △ (B △ A):\n\n1. (A △ B) △ A = ({1, 4} △ {1, 2, 3})\n\n(A △ B) ∪ A = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n(A △ B) ∩ A = {1}\n\n(A △ B) △ A = {2, 3, 4}\n\n2.

Therefore, (A △ B) △ A ≠ A △ (B △ A)."
