    "message_1": "How many non-isomorphic groups of order 96 are there, and what are they?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group is congruent to 1 modulo p and divides the order of the group.\n\nThe prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1. Therefore, we need to find the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups of a group of order 96.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32 (2^5).\n2. Three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16 (2^4).\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. One Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3 (3^1).\n\nNow, we can combine these possibilities to form groups of order 96:\n\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 32 and one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n2. Three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16 and one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3.\n\nFor case 1, the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 32 is 51 (according to OEIS A000679). Since the Sylow 3-subgroup is unique, it is normal, and we can form a semi-direct product with the Sylow 2-subgroup. Thus, we have 51 possibilities in this case.\n\nFor case 2, the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 16 is 14 (according to OEIS A000679). Since there are three Sylow 2-subgroups, the Sylow 3-subgroup is not necessarily normal, and we need to consider the action of the Sylow 3-subgroup on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups. There are two possibilities for this action: either the Sylow 3-subgroup acts trivially, or it acts non-trivially.\n\nIf the action is trivial, we can form a direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. This gives us 14 possibilities.\n\nIf the action is non-trivial, we can form a semi-direct product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup. However, not all of these semi-direct products will be distinct, so we need to count the number of distinct semi-direct products. This can be done using the second cohomology group, but it is quite involved. The result is that there are 8 distinct semi-direct products in this case.\n\nThus, in case 2, we have a total of 14 + 8 = 22 possibilities.\n\nCombining both cases, we have a total of 51 + 22 = 73 non-isomorphic groups of order 96."
