The public key 'A' is generated using the formula A = 7^a mod 101. Now Bob wants to sign the message \"HELLO\" using his private key 'a' and the SHA-1 hash function, which outputs a 160-bit hash value. Calculate the digital signature for the message \"HELLO\" using Bob's private key 'a' and the given hash function.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the digital signature for the message \"HELLO\" using Bob's private key 'a' and the SHA-1 hash function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the hash of the message \"HELLO\" using the SHA-1 hash function.\n2. Convert the hash value into an integer.\n3. Compute the digital signature using the private key 'a' and the hash value.\n\nStep 1: Compute the hash of the message \"HELLO\" using the SHA-1 hash function.\n\nThe SHA-1 hash of the message \"HELLO\" is \"F7FF9E8B7BB2E09B70935A5D785E0CC5D9D0ABF0\".\n\nStep 2: Convert the hash value into an integer.\n\nThe hash value \"F7FF9E8B7BB2E09B70935A5D785E0CC5D9D0ABF0\" in hexadecimal can be converted into an integer as follows:\n\nF7FF9E8B7BB2E09B70935A5D785E0CC5D9D0ABF0 (hex) = 173516678478610102127906893953197289160299984 (decimal)\n\nStep 3: Compute the digital signature using the private key 'a' and the hash value.\n\nThe digital signature 'S' can be computed using the formula S = H^a mod 101, where H is the hash value as an integer, and 'a' is the private key.\n\nHowever, we don't have the exact value of 'a' since it is only given that 1 <= a <= 100. Therefore, we cannot compute the exact digital signature for the message \"HELLO\" using Bob's private key 'a' and the given hash function.\n\nIf we had the exact value of 'a', we could compute the digital signature using the formula S = H^a mod 101."
