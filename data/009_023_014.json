    "message_2": "To find the soliton wave solution for the given Nonlinear Schrödinger equation with the initial condition, we can use the ansatz for a soliton solution:\n\n$$\\psi(x,t) = A(t) e^{i(kx - \\omega t + \\theta(t))} e^{-\\alpha(t) (x - x_0(t))^2}$$\n\nHere, $A(t)$ is the amplitude, $k$ is the wave number, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, $\\theta(t)$ is the phase, $\\alpha(t)$ is the width parameter, and $x_0(t)$ is the center of the soliton wave.\n\nNow, we need to match the initial condition $\\psi(x,0) = (1+4i)e^{-x^2}$ with the ansatz. At $t=0$, we have:\n\n$$\\psi(x,0) = A(0) e^{i(kx + \\theta(0))} e^{-\\alpha(0) (x - x_0(0))^2}$$\n\nComparing the initial condition and the ansatz at $t=0$, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. $A(0) = 1+4i$\n2. $k = 0$ (since there is no $x$-dependence in the initial condition)\n3. $\\theta(0) = 0$ (since the initial condition has no phase)\n4. $\\alpha(0) = 1$ (to match the Gaussian width)\n5. $x_0(0) = 0$ (since the Gaussian is centered at $x=0$)\n\nNow, we need to find the time-dependence of the parameters. For a soliton solution, the amplitude $A(t)$, width parameter $\\alpha(t)$, and phase $\\theta(t)$ are constant, while the center $x_0(t)$ moves with a constant speed $v$. Therefore, we have:\n\n1. $A(t) = 1+4i$\n2. $\\alpha(t) = 1$\n3. $\\theta(t) = 0$\n4. $x_0(t) = vt$\n\nThe speed $v$ can be found from the dispersion relation of the Nonlinear Schrödinger equation:\n\n$$\\omega = k^2 - 2|A|^2$$\n\nSince $k=0$, we have:\n\n$$\\omega = -2|A|^2 = -2|(1+4i)|^2 = -2(1+16+8i) = -34 - 16i$$\n\nNow, we can write the soliton wave solution for $t>0$:\n\n$$\\psi(x,t) = (1+4i) e^{-i(34+16i)t} e^{-(x-vt)^2}$$"
