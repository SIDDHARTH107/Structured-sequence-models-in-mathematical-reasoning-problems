    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Poisson distribution, which is a probability distribution that models the number of events (in this case, failures) in a fixed interval of time (6 months). The formula for the Poisson distribution is:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k failures occurring in the given time period\n- λ (lambda) is the average number of failures in the time period (failure rate * number of months)\n- k is the number of failures we are interested in (0, 1, or 2 in this case)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n- k! is the factorial of k (the product of all positive integers up to k)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate λ:\n\nλ = failure rate * number of months = 0.05 * 6 = 0.3\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probability of having 0, 1, or 2 failures in the 6-month period:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-0.3) * 0.3^0) / 0! = (0.740818 * 1) / 1 = 0.740818\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-0.3) * 0.3^1) / 1! = (0.740818 * 0.3) / 1 = 0.222245\nP(X = 2) = (e^(-0.3) * 0.3^2) / 2! = (0.740818 * 0.09) / 2 = 0.033337\n\nFinally, we need to add these probabilities together to find the probability of having no more than 2 failures:\n\nP(X ≤ 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 0.740818 + 0.222245 + 0.033337 = 0.9964\n\nSo, the probability that no more than 2 failures occur in a given 6-month period is approximately 0.9964 or 99.64%."
