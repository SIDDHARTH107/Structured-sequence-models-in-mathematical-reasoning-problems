    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation $z''(t) + 2z'(t) + 2z(t) = 0$, we first find the characteristic equation. This is done by assuming a solution of the form $z(t) = e^{rt}$, where $r$ is a complex number. Plugging this into the differential equation, we get:\n\n$(r^2 + 2r + 2)e^{rt} = 0$\n\nSince $e^{rt}$ is never zero, we can divide both sides by it, leaving us with the characteristic equation:\n\n$r^2 + 2r + 2 = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = 2$, and $c = 2$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$r = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} = -1 \\pm i$\n\nSo, the roots are $r_1 = -1 + i$ and $r_2 = -1 - i$. Since the roots are complex, the general solution to the differential equation is given by:\n\n$z(t) = C_1 e^{(-1 + i)t} + C_2 e^{(-1 - i)t}$\n\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are complex constants determined by initial conditions."
