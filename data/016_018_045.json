    "message_2": "The Cantor dust obtained by removing the middle third of a line segment three times is also known as the Cantor set. The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Cantor set, after each iteration, the line segment is divided into 2 self-similar pieces (N = 2), and the scaling factor is 3 (r = 3) since we are removing the middle third of the line segment.\n\nHence, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(2) / log(3) â‰ˆ 0.6309"
