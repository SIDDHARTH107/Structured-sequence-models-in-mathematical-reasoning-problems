    "message_2": "To find the conformal mapping, we will use the Möbius transformation. A Möbius transformation is a function of the form:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $ad - bc \\neq 0$. \n\nFirst, we need to find a Möbius transformation that maps the point $i/2$ to $0$. We can do this by setting $b = -ai/2$, so the transformation becomes:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{a(z - i/2)}{cz + d}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $a, c,$ and $d$ such that the unit disc is mapped onto the upper half-plane. We know that the boundary of the unit disc is the circle $|z| = 1$, so we want to find a transformation that maps this circle onto the real axis (the boundary of the upper half-plane).\n\nLet's consider three points on the boundary of the unit disc: $1, i,$ and $-1$. We want to find a transformation that maps these points onto the real axis. Since we already know that $i/2$ is mapped to $0$, we can choose two more points to determine the transformation.\n\nLet's choose the points $1$ and $-1$. We want to find a transformation that maps $1$ to $\\infty$ and $-1$ to some real number. To map $1$ to $\\infty$, we can set $c = a$ and $d = -ai/2$. Now the transformation becomes:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{a(z - i/2)}{a(z + i/2)}$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $a$:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z - i/2}{z + i/2}$$\n\nNow, let's check if this transformation maps $-1$ to a real number:\n\n$$f(-1) = \\frac{-1 - i/2}{-1 + i/2}$$\n\nTo find the real part of this expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n\n$$f(-1) = \\frac{(-1 - i/2)(-1 - i/2)}{(-1 + i/2)(-1 - i/2)} = \\frac{1 + i - i/2 - 1/4}{1 + 1/4} = \\frac{3/4 + i/2}{5/4}$$\n\nSince the imaginary part of this expression is non-zero, we can conclude that the transformation maps $-1$ to a real number. Therefore, the conformal mapping that transforms the unit disc onto the upper half-plane and maps the point $i/2$ to the point $0$ is:\n\n$$f(z) = \\frac{z - i/2}{z + i/2}$$"
