    "message_2": "To design the feedback control law, we first need to find the closed-loop transfer function of the system. We can rewrite the given differential equation as follows:\n\n$$y''(t) + 3y'(t) + 2y(t) = k_1y(t) + k_2y'(t)$$\n\nNow, we take the Laplace transform of both sides:\n\n$$s^2Y(s) + 3sY(s) + 2Y(s) = k_1Y(s) + k_2sY(s)$$\n\nRearrange the equation to find the transfer function $G(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}$:\n\n$$Y(s)(s^2 + 3s + 2 - k_1 - k_2s) = U(s)$$\n\n$$G(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \\frac{1}{s^2 + (3-k_2)s + (2-k_1)}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $k_1$ and $k_2$ that satisfy the given performance requirements. The settling time $T_s$ is given by:\n\n$$T_s = \\frac{4}{\\zeta\\omega_n}$$\n\nwhere $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio and $\\omega_n$ is the natural frequency. Since we want the system to settle within 2 seconds, we have:\n\n$$2 = \\frac{4}{\\zeta\\omega_n}$$\n\nThe overshoot requirement is given by:\n\n$$\\%OS = 100 e^{\\frac{-\\pi\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}} \\leq 5$$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $\\zeta$ and $\\omega_n$ that satisfy these requirements. From the settling time equation, we get:\n\n$$\\zeta\\omega_n = 2$$\n\nFrom the overshoot equation, we can find that $\\zeta \\approx 0.7$ (by trial and error or using a standard table for overshoot values). Now, we can find the natural frequency:\n\n$$\\omega_n = \\frac{2}{\\zeta} \\approx \\frac{2}{0.7} \\approx 2.857$$\n\nNow, we can find the desired closed-loop transfer function poles:\n\n$$s = -\\zeta\\omega_n \\pm \\omega_n\\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1} \\approx -2 \\pm 2.857j$$\n\nThe closed-loop characteristic equation is:\n\n$$s^2 + (3-k_2)s + (2-k_1) = 0$$\n\nBy comparing the desired poles with the characteristic equation, we can find the values of $k_1$ and $k_2$:\n\n$$k_1 = 2 - (-2)^2 = 2 - 4 = -2$$\n$$k_2 = 3 - 2(-2) = 3 + 4 = 7$$\n\nSo, the feedback control law that achieves the desired performance is:\n\n$$u(t) = -2y(t) + 7y'(t)$$"
