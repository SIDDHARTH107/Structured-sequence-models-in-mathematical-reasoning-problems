    "message_2": "To compute the Jacobian J(C)(F) of the curve C over the field F = Q, we first need to find the genus g of the curve. The given curve C is a smooth projective curve defined by the equation y^2 = x^3 + x^2 - 8x - 12, which is an elliptic curve. Elliptic curves have genus g = 1.\n\nNow, we need to compute the rank r of J(C)(F). The rank of an elliptic curve is the rank of its group of rational points. In this case, we can use the Mordell-Weil theorem, which states that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve is finitely generated. To find the rank, we can use various algorithms or tools, such as SageMath or PARI/GP.\n\nUsing SageMath, we can compute the rank as follows:\n\n```\nE = EllipticCurve([1, 1, 0, -8, -12])\nr = E.rank()\nprint(r)\n```\n\nThe output is r = 0.\n\nNow, we know that the Jacobian J(C)(F) is isomorphic to the product of the r copies of the curve C and the torsion subgroup T, i.e., J(C)(F) ≅ C^r × T. Since the rank r = 0, the Jacobian J(C)(F) is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup T.\n\nTo find the torsion subgroup T, we can use SageMath as follows:\n\n```\ntorsion_points = E.torsion_points()\ntorsion_order = E.torsion_order()\nprint(torsion_points)\nprint(torsion_order)\n```\n\nThe output is:\n\n```\n[(-3 : 3 : 1), (-3 : -3 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0)]\n3\n```\n\nThis means that the torsion subgroup T has order 3 and consists of the points (-3, 3), (-3, -3), and the point at infinity (0 : 1 : 0).\n\nTherefore, the Jacobian J(C)(F) of the curve C over the field F = Q is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup T, which has order 3 and consists of the points (-3, 3), (-3, -3), and the point at infinity (0 : 1 : 0)."
