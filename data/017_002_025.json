    "message_2": "To show that H is a cyclic subgroup of G, we need to show that there exists an element in H that generates the entire subgroup H.\n\nSince H is a subgroup of G of order 5, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of H must divide the order of G. In this case, the order of G is 15, and the order of H is 5, which indeed divides 15 (15 = 5 * 3).\n\nNow, let's consider an element h in H. Since H has order 5, the order of h must also divide 5. The possible orders of h are 1 and 5, as these are the divisors of 5. If the order of h is 1, then h is the identity element of G. However, we are looking for a generator of H, which means we need an element with order 5.\n\nBy Cauchy's theorem, there must exist an element in H with order 5. Let's call this element g. Since the order of g is 5, we have:\n\ng^1 ≠ e (identity element)\ng^2 ≠ e\ng^3 ≠ e\ng^4 ≠ e\ng^5 = e\n\nWhere e is the identity element in G. Now, let's consider the powers of g:\n\n{g^1, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5} = {g^1, g^2, g^3, g^4, e}\n\nSince the order of g is 5, all these powers are distinct, and we have 5 distinct elements in the set. This set of elements forms a subgroup of G, and since H has order 5, this set of elements is equal to H. Therefore, g generates the entire subgroup H, and H is a cyclic subgroup of G."
