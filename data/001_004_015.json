    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial x^2 + 7x + 10, we need to find two numbers that multiply to the constant term (10) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (7).\n\nThe two numbers that satisfy these conditions are 5 and 2, since 5 * 2 = 10 and 5 + 2 = 7.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the polynomial as:\n\nx^2 + 5x + 2x + 10\n\nNext, we can factor by grouping:\n\nx(x + 5) + 2(x + 5)\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term (x + 5):\n\n(x + 5)(x + 2)\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial is (x + 5)(x + 2).\n\nTo solve the equation x^2 + 7x + 10 = 0, we set each factor equal to zero:\n\nx + 5 = 0 or x + 2 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = -5 or x = -2\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation x^2 + 7x + 10 = 0 are x = -5 and x = -2."
