    "message_2": "The hyperbolic convex hull of a regular dodecahedron is not a well-defined concept, as the hyperbolic space is a non-Euclidean geometry with constant negative curvature. Regular dodecahedra exist in Euclidean space, which has constant zero curvature. \n\nHowever, we can calculate the volume of a regular dodecahedron in Euclidean space. The formula for the volume V of a regular dodecahedron with edge length a is:\n\nV = (15 + 7√5)/4 * a³\n\nGiven that the edge length is 2 meters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nV = (15 + 7√5)/4 * (2³)\nV = (15 + 7√5)/4 * 8\nV = (15 + 7√5) * 2\n\nNow, we can approximate the value:\n\nV ≈ (15 + 7 * 2.236) * 2\nV ≈ (15 + 15.652) * 2\nV ≈ 30.652 * 2\nV ≈ 61.304 m³\n\nSo, the volume of the regular dodecahedron with edge length 2 meters in Euclidean space is approximately 61.304 cubic meters."
