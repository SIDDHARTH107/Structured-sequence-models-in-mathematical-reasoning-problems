However, the dealership knows which cars are high-quality and which are low-quality, but the customers do not. The dealership offers a warranty for $2,500 that will cover any repairs needed within the first year of owning the car. A customer who buys the car and purchases the warranty will bring the car back for repairs if it is low-quality, but will not bring it back if it is high-quality. If 60% of the used cars sold are low-quality, how much should the dealership charge for the warranty to break even on the repairs?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the cost of repairs for low-quality cars as L and the cost of repairs for high-quality cars as H. Since high-quality car owners do not bring their cars back for repairs, we can assume H = 0. We want to find the cost of the warranty, W, that will make the dealership break even on the repairs.\n\nThe probability of a car being low-quality is 60%, so the expected cost of repairs for a car sold with a warranty is 0.6 * L. The dealership will break even when the revenue from the warranty equals the expected cost of repairs, which can be represented by the equation:\n\nW = 0.6 * L\n\nNow, we need to find the value of L. Since the dealership knows the value of the cars, we can assume that the average repair cost for low-quality cars is the difference between the average value of high-quality cars and low-quality cars, minus the cost of the warranty:\n\nL = $20,000 - $10,000 - $2,500 = $7,500\n\nNow we can plug this value back into the equation for W:\n\nW = 0.6 * $7,500 = $4,500\n\nSo, the dealership should charge $4,500 for the warranty to break even on the repairs."
