    "message_2": "On Wednesday, the store sold 50% more items than on Tuesday. To find the number of items sold on Wednesday, we first need to find 50% of the items sold on Tuesday.\n\n50% of 150 items = (50/100) * 150 = 0.5 * 150 = 75 items\n\nNow, we add this 75 items to the original 150 items sold on Tuesday to find the total number of items sold on Wednesday:\n\n150 items + 75 items = 225 items\n\nSo, the store sold 225 items on Wednesday."
