    "message_1": "A student wants to form a committee of 4 people from a group of 7 students. How many different committees can they form?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of different committees that can be formed, we need to use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (7 in this case), k is the number of students in the committee (4 in this case), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4!(7-4)!)\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4!3!)\n\nC(7, 4) = (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(7, 4) = (7 × 6 × 5) / (4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(7, 4) = 210 / 24\n\nC(7, 4) = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 different committees that can be formed from a group of 7 students."
