    "message_2": "The central difference formula is given by:\n\nf'(x) ≈ (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2h)\n\nwhere f'(x) is the first derivative of the function f(x), h is the step size, and x is the point at which we want to approximate the derivative.\n\nIn this case, f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 10, x = 2, and h = 0.1.\n\nFirst, let's find f(x + h) and f(x - h):\n\nf(2 + 0.1) = (2 + 0.1)^2 - 5(2 + 0.1) + 10 = 2.21 - 10.5 + 10 = 1.71\nf(2 - 0.1) = (2 - 0.1)^2 - 5(2 - 0.1) + 10 = 1.81 - 9.5 + 10 = 2.31\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the central difference formula:\n\nf'(2) ≈ (f(2 + 0.1) - f(2 - 0.1)) / (2 * 0.1) = (1.71 - 2.31) / 0.2 = -0.6 / 0.2 = -3\n\nSo, the approximation for the first derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 10 at x = 2 using the central difference formula with a step size of 0.1 is -3."
