    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of S at the point P (1, 0, 1), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface S.\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the metric tensor g_ij, where g_ij = <∂x/∂u_i, ∂x/∂u_j>. Let's compute the partial derivatives of x(u, v) with respect to u and v:\n\n∂x/∂u = (1, 0, 2u)\n∂x/∂v = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nNow, we can compute the metric tensor g_ij:\n\ng_11 = <(1, 0, 2u), (1, 0, 2u)> = 1 + 4u^2\ng_12 = g_21 = <(1, 0, 2u), (0, 1, -2v)> = 0\ng_22 = <(0, 1, -2v), (0, 1, -2v)> = 1 + 4v^2\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix G = [g_ij] = [(1 + 4u^2, 0), (0, 1 + 4v^2)].\n\nNext, we compute the second fundamental form, which is given by the shape operator matrix h_ij, where h_ij = -<∂^2x/∂u_i∂u_j, N>, and N is the unit normal vector to the surface S.\n\nFirst, let's find the normal vector N. The normal vector is given by the cross product of the partial derivatives of x(u, v):\n\nN = ∂x/∂u × ∂x/∂v = (1, 0, 2u) × (0, 1, -2v) = (4uv, 4u^2 + 4v^2, 1)\n\nNow, we normalize N to get the unit normal vector:\n\n|N| = √(16u^2v^2 + (4u^2 + 4v^2)^2 + 1)\nN_normalized = (4uv/|N|, (4u^2 + 4v^2)/|N|, 1/|N|)\n\nNext, we compute the second derivatives of x(u, v):\n\n∂^2x/∂u^2 = (0, 0, 2)\n∂^2x/∂u∂v = ∂^2x/∂v∂u = (0, 0, 0)\n∂^2x/∂v^2 = (0, 0, -2)\n\nNow, we can compute the shape operator matrix h_ij:\n\nh_11 = -<(0, 0, 2), N_normalized> = -2/|N|\nh_12 = h_21 = -<(0, 0, 0), N_normalized> = 0\nh_22 = -<(0, 0, -2), N_normalized> = 2/|N|\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix H = [h_ij] = [(-2/|N|, 0), (0, 2/|N|)].\n\nNow, we can compute the sectional curvature K at the point P (1, 0, 1) using the formula:\n\nK = det(H) / det(G)\n\nAt the point P (1, 0, 1), we have:\n\nG = [(1 + 4(1)^2, 0), (0, 1 + 4(0)^2)] = [(5, 0), (0, 1)]\nH = [(-2/|N|, 0), (0, 2/|N|)]\n\nAt P, |N| = √(16(1)^2(0)^2 + (4(1)^2 + 4(0)^2)^2 + 1) = √(17)\nSo, H = [(-2/√(17), 0), (0, 2/√(17))]\n\nNow, we compute the determinants:\n\ndet(G) = 5 * 1 - 0 * 0 = 5\ndet(H) = (-2/√(17)) * (2/√(17)) - 0 * 0 = 4/17\n\nFinally, we find the sectional curvature K:\n\nK = det(H) / det(G) = (4/17) / 5 = 4 / (17 * 5) = 4 / 85\n\nSo, the sectional curvature of S at the point P (1, 0, 1) is K = 4/85."
