    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one triangle, then multiply it by 6 (since there are 6 triangles in a hexagon).\n\nThe side length of the equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the hexagon, which is 8 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side² * √3) / 4\n\nPlugging in the side length:\n\nArea = (8² * √3) / 4\nArea = (64 * √3) / 4\nArea = 16√3 square centimeters\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one triangle by 6 to find the area of the hexagon:\n\nHexagon area = 6 * (16√3)\nHexagon area = 96√3 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the regular hexagon is 96√3 square centimeters."
