    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set and A be a subset of U such that U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and A = {1, 2, 3}. Find the complement of A, then find the union of A and its complement. Show that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "To find the complement of A, we need to find all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. \n\nThe complement of A, denoted as A', can be found by comparing the elements in U and A:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nA = {1, 2, 3}\n\nA' = {4, 5} (These are the elements in U that are not in A)\n\nNow, let's find the union of A and its complement A'. The union of two sets is the set containing all the elements from both sets, without repetition.\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3} ∪ {4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nWe can see that the union of A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U:\n\nA ∪ A' = U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nThis demonstrates that the union of a set A and its complement A' is equal to the universal set U."
