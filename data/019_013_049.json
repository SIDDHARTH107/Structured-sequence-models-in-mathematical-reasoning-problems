    "message_2": "In second-order logic, we can define the concept of even numbers and summation using predicates and quantifiers. Let's define the following predicates:\n\n1. E(x): x is an even number.\n2. S(x, y, z): The sum of x and y is z.\n\nNow, we can express the problem as finding the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 30. We can represent this using second-order logic as follows:\n\n∃k [ (k = Σ {x : 1 < x < 30 ∧ E(x)}) ]\n\nHere, k represents the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 30. To solve this problem, we can first find all the even numbers between 1 and 30 and then calculate their sum.\n\nThe even numbers between 1 and 30 are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30.\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum:\n\nk = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 20 + 22 + 24 + 26 + 28 + 30\nk = 240\n\nSo, the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 30 is 240."
