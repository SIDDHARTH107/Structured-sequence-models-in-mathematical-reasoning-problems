    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Factorize the order of the group: 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5\n2. Determine the number of possible groups for each prime divisor using the formula: n_p = (p^(k+1) - 1) / (p - 1), where p is the prime divisor and k is its exponent in the factorization.\n\nFor p = 2, k = 3: n_2 = (2^(3+1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = (16 - 1) / 1 = 15\nFor p = 3, k = 1: n_3 = (3^(1+1) - 1) / (3 - 1) = (9 - 1) / 2 = 4\nFor p = 5, k = 1: n_5 = (5^(1+1) - 1) / (5 - 1) = (25 - 1) / 4 = 6\n\n3. Use the formula for the number of non-isomorphic groups of order n: gcd(n_p, n_q) = 1 for all distinct prime divisors p and q.\n\nThe greatest common divisor (gcd) of all pairs of numbers (n_2, n_3, n_5) is 1, so we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of non-isomorphic groups = n_2 * n_3 * n_5 = 15 * 4 * 6 = 360\n\nTherefore, there are 360 non-isomorphic groups of order 120."
