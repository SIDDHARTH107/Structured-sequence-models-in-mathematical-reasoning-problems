    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 3 -2  1 |  6 ]\n[ 6 -4  2 | 12 ]\n[ 9 -6  3 | 18 ]\n```\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to obtain a row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Divide the first row by 3 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2/3  1/3 |  2 ]\n[ 6 -4    2   | 12 ]\n[ 9 -6    3   | 18 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate the leading terms in the second and third rows by subtracting multiples of the first row:\n\nSubtract 6 times the first row from the second row:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2/3  1/3 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0    0   |  0 ]\n[ 9 -6    3   | 18 ]\n```\n\nSubtract 9 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1 -2/3  1/3 |  2 ]\n[ 0  0    0   |  0 ]\n[ 0  0    0   |  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have reached the row-echelon form. We can see that the second and third rows are all zeros, which means that the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. This is because we have only one independent equation and three unknowns (x, y, and z).\n\nTo check if the matrix of coefficients is ill-conditioned, we can calculate its determinant. If the determinant is close to zero, the matrix is considered ill-conditioned.\n\nThe matrix of coefficients is:\n\n```\n[ 3 -2  1 ]\n[ 6 -4  2 ]\n[ 9 -6  3 ]\n```\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\n```\ndet(A) = 3((-4*3) - (2*2*3)) - (-2)((6*3) - (2*9)) + 1(6*(-6) - (-4*9))\n       = 3(-12 - 12) - (-2)(18 - 18) + 1(-36 + 36)\n       = 3(-24) - 0 + 0\n       = -72\n```\n\nSince the determinant is not close to zero, the matrix of coefficients is not ill-conditioned. However, the system of linear equations is still dependent, as shown by the row-echelon form, and has infinitely many solutions."
