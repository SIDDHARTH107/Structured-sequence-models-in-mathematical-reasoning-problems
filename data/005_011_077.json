    "message_1": "An experimenter wants to test the effectiveness of a new fertilizer on plant growth. He randomly chooses 50 plants and divides them into two groups of 25 plants each. One group is treated with the new fertilizer, and the other group is not treated. After four weeks, he measures the height of each plant in centimeters. The heights of the treated group have a mean of 35 cm with a standard deviation of 4 cm. The heights of the control group have a mean of 28 cm with a standard deviation of 5 cm. \n\nQuestion: Is there evidence at the 5% level of significance that the new fertilizer improves plant growth?",
    "message_2": "To test the hypothesis that the new fertilizer improves plant growth at the 5% level of significance, we will perform a two-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no difference in the mean height of plants treated with the new fertilizer and the control group (i.e., the mean difference is 0). The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the mean height of plants treated with the new fertilizer is greater than the control group (i.e., the mean difference is greater than 0).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the pooled standard error (SE) for the two groups. The formula for the pooled SE is:\n\nSE = sqrt[(s1^2/n1) + (s2^2/n2)]\n\nwhere s1 and s2 are the standard deviations of the treated and control groups, respectively, and n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of the treated and control groups, respectively.\n\nSE = sqrt[(4^2/25) + (5^2/25)]\nSE = sqrt[(16/25) + (25/25)]\nSE = sqrt[0.64 + 1]\nSE = sqrt[1.64]\nSE = 1.28\n\nNext, we calculate the t-value using the formula:\n\nt = (mean1 - mean2) / SE\n\nwhere mean1 and mean2 are the means of the treated and control groups, respectively.\n\nt = (35 - 28) / 1.28\nt = 7 / 1.28\nt â‰ˆ 5.47\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test at the 5% level of significance with degrees of freedom (df) equal to the total sample size minus 2 (i.e., n1 + n2 - 2 = 50 - 2 = 48). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately 1.677.\n\nSince our calculated t-value (5.47) is greater than the critical t-value (1.677), we reject the null hypothesis (H0) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1). There is evidence at the 5% level of significance that the new fertilizer improves plant growth."
