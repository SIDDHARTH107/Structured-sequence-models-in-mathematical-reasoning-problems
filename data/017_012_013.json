    "message_2": "There are 14 distinct groups of order 16. We will show that every group of order 16 is isomorphic to one of the following groups: the cyclic group C16, one of the five abelian groups (C4 × C4, C8 × C2, C2 × C2 × C2 × C2, C4 × C2 × C2, and C2 × C2 × C4), the dihedral group D8, or one of the seven non-abelian groups of order 16.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cyclic group C16. This group has a single generator, say g, and its elements are {1, g, g^2, ..., g^15}. The Cayley table for this group is straightforward to construct, as the product of any two elements is determined by the sum of their exponents modulo 16.\n\nNext, let's consider the dihedral group D8. This group has 16 elements and can be represented as the set {r^n, r^n s | n = 0, 1, ..., 7}, where r is a rotation and s is a reflection. The Cayley table for this group can be constructed using the relations r^8 = 1, s^2 = 1, and sr = r^(-1)s.\n\nFor the five abelian groups, their Cayley tables can be constructed using the direct product of their cyclic components. For example, the Cayley table for C4 × C4 can be constructed using the direct product of two C4 groups.\n\nFinally, for the seven non-abelian groups of order 16, their Cayley tables can be constructed using various presentations and relations. For example, one such non-abelian group can be represented as the set {a^i b^j | i = 0, 1, ..., 7; j = 0, 1, ..., 1}, with the relations a^8 = 1, b^2 = a^4, and ab = ba^3.\n\nTo prove that every group of order 16 is isomorphic to one of these groups, we can use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 16. By the Sylow theorems, G has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 16. The possible structures of P are determined by the number of elements of order 2 and the number of cyclic subgroups of order 4 and 8.\n\nBy comparing the structure of P with the structures of the groups listed above, we can determine which group G is isomorphic to. For example, if P has a unique element of order 2, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C16. If P has five elements of order 2 and three cyclic subgroups of order 4, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D8.\n\nIn this way, we can show that every group of order 16 is isomorphic to one of the 14 groups listed above."
