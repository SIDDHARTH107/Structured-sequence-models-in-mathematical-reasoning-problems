    "message_1": "Let's say that the current stock price of XYZ Corporation is $100 per share. Based on historical data, the probability of the stock price increasing by at least 10% in the next month is found to be 0.25. What is the probability of the stock price remaining below $110 per share in the next month?",
    "message_2": "If the probability of the stock price increasing by at least 10% in the next month is 0.25, then the probability of it not increasing by 10% (i.e., remaining below $110 per share) is the complement of that probability.\n\nThe complement of a probability is calculated as 1 minus the probability. In this case:\n\n1 - 0.25 = 0.75\n\nSo, the probability of the stock price remaining below $110 per share in the next month is 0.75 or 75%."
