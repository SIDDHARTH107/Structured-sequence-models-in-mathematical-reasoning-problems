    "message_1": "A Lévy C curve starts at (0,0) and ends at (1,0). It starts by moving 1/4 of the way upwards, and then continues by moving 1/4 of the arc length of a quarter circle. This process repeats itself infinitely many times, with each step being 1/4 of the previous step. What is the length of the Lévy C curve?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the Lévy C curve, we can use the geometric series formula to sum the infinite series of arc lengths. The geometric series formula is:\n\nS = a / (1 - r)\n\nwhere S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, the first term a is the length of the first arc, which is 1/4 of the arc length of a quarter circle. The arc length of a quarter circle with radius 1 is (1/4) * 2π * 1 = π/2. So, the first term a = (1/4) * (π/2) = π/8.\n\nThe common ratio r is 1/4, as each step is 1/4 of the previous step.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the geometric series formula:\n\nS = (π/8) / (1 - 1/4)\nS = (π/8) / (3/4)\nS = (π/8) * (4/3)\nS = π/6\n\nSo, the length of the Lévy C curve is π/6."
