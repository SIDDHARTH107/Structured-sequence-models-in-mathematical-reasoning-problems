    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) = (z-1)/(z+2) centered at z=0, we first rewrite the function in a more suitable form for expansion. We can do this by performing long division or using partial fraction decomposition. In this case, we will use partial fraction decomposition.\n\nf(z) = (z-1)/(z+2) = A/(z+2) + B\n(z-1) = A + B(z+2)\n\nBy comparing coefficients, we get the following system of linear equations:\n\nA + 2B = -1\nB = 1\n\nSolving this system, we find A = -3 and B = 1. Thus, we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = -3/(z+2) + 1/(z+2)\n\nNow, we can find the Laurent series expansion of each term. For the first term, we can use the geometric series formula:\n\n-3/(z+2) = -3 * 1/(1+(z/2)) = -3 * Σ((-z/2)^n) for |z/2| < 1\n\nExpanding the series, we get:\n\n-3 * (1 - (z/2) + (z/2)^2 - (z/2)^3 + ...)\n\nFor the second term, we have:\n\n1/(z+2) = 1/(2(1+(z/2))) = 1/2 * 1/(1+(z/2)) = 1/2 * Σ((-z/2)^n) for |z/2| < 1\n\nExpanding the series, we get:\n\n1/2 * (1 - (z/2) + (z/2)^2 - (z/2)^3 + ...)\n\nNow, we can combine the two series to get the Laurent series expansion of f(z):\n\nf(z) = -3 * (1 - (z/2) + (z/2)^2 - (z/2)^3 + ...) + 1/2 * (1 - (z/2) + (z/2)^2 - (z/2)^3 + ...)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nf(z) = (1/2 - 3) + (3/2 - 1/2)z + (-3/4 + 1/4)z^2 + ...\n\nf(z) = -5/2 + z - z^2/2 + ...\n\nThe annulus of convergence is determined by the geometric series formula used in the expansion. In this case, the series converges for |z/2| < 1, which implies |z| < 2. Therefore, the annulus of convergence is 0 < |z| < 2."
