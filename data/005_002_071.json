    "message_1": "A factory produces detergent bottles with an average fill volume of 1.2 liters and a standard deviation of 0.05 liters. A random sample of 36 bottles is taken. Determine a 95% confidence interval for the mean fill volume of the detergent bottles produced by the factory.",
    "message_2": "To determine a 95% confidence interval for the mean fill volume of the detergent bottles, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a sample mean:\n\nCI = x̄ ± Z * (σ / √n)\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, x̄ is the sample mean, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, σ is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nx̄ = 1.2 liters (average fill volume)\nσ = 0.05 liters (standard deviation)\nn = 36 (sample size)\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (you can find this value in a standard Z-score table).\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = 1.2 ± 1.96 * (0.05 / √36)\n\nCI = 1.2 ± 1.96 * (0.05 / 6)\n\nCI = 1.2 ± 1.96 * 0.008333\n\nCI = 1.2 ± 0.016333\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the mean fill volume of the detergent bottles is (1.183667, 1.216333) liters. This means that we can be 95% confident that the true mean fill volume of the detergent bottles produced by the factory lies between 1.183667 liters and 1.216333 liters."
