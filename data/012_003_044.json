    "message_2": "To find the maximum independent set in this graph, we can use the fact that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In this case, each of the 8 vertices has a degree of 3, so the sum of the degrees is 8 * 3 = 24. Therefore, there are 24/2 = 12 edges in the graph.\n\nNow, let's consider the structure of the graph. Since each vertex is connected to exactly 3 other vertices, the graph must be a 3-regular graph. One possible configuration for such a graph is the 3-regular graph with 8 vertices known as the \"cuboctahedron\" graph.\n\nThe maximum independent set in a graph is the largest set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are connected by an edge. In the case of the cuboctahedron graph, the maximum independent set has a size of 4. This can be seen by selecting the 4 vertices that form a \"square\" in the graph, as these vertices are not connected to each other.\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set in this graph is 4."
