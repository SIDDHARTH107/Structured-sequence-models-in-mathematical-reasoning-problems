    "message_1": "Suppose Player 1 owns a company and hires Player 2 as the CEO. The company makes a profit of $100,000 with probability 0.6 and a profit of $50,000 with probability 0.4. Player 2 can choose to exert high effort or low effort. If Player 2 exerts high effort, the probability of making a profit of $100,000 increases to 0.8, but if they exert low effort, the probability of making a profit of $100,000 decreases to 0.4. However, Player 1 cannot observe the effort level of Player 2. If Player 2 exerts high effort, they receive an additional bonus of $20,000. However, if they exert low effort, they receive a bonus of only $5,000. What is the optimal strategy for Player 2 and what is the expected profit for Player 1?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, we need to calculate the expected profit for both high effort and low effort scenarios.\n\nHigh effort:\nExpected profit = (0.8 * $100,000) + (0.2 * $50,000) - $20,000 (bonus)\nExpected profit = $80,000 + $10,000 - $20,000\nExpected profit = $70,000\n\nLow effort:\nExpected profit = (0.4 * $100,000) + (0.6 * $50,000) - $5,000 (bonus)\nExpected profit = $40,000 + $30,000 - $5,000\nExpected profit = $65,000\n\nSince the expected profit for high effort ($70,000) is greater than the expected profit for low effort ($65,000), the optimal strategy for Player 2 is to exert high effort.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected profit for Player 1 when Player 2 exerts high effort:\n\nExpected profit for Player 1 = (0.8 * $100,000) + (0.2 * $50,000) - $20,000 (bonus for Player 2)\nExpected profit for Player 1 = $80,000 + $10,000 - $20,000\nExpected profit for Player 1 = $70,000\n\nSo, the optimal strategy for Player 2 is to exert high effort, and the expected profit for Player 1 is $70,000."
