    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the wave equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T''(t) = 4X''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $4XT$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{4T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side is a function of $t$ only and the right side is a function of $x$ only, they must both be equal to a constant, say $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{T''(t)}{4T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1) $X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$\n\n2) $T''(t) + 4\\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\cos(\\pi x)$:\n\n$X(x)T(0) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) = \\cos(\\pi x)$\n\nSince this must hold for all $x$, we have $A = 1$ and $\\lambda = \\pi$. Thus, $X(x) = \\cos(\\pi x)$.\n\nNow, let's solve the second equation:\n\n$T''(t) + 4\\pi^2 T(t) = 0$\n\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator equation with angular frequency $2\\pi$. The general solution is:\n\n$T(t) = C\\cos(2\\pi t) + D\\sin(2\\pi t)$\n\nApplying the initial condition $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$, we get:\n\n$-2\\pi D\\cos(\\pi x) = 0$\n\nSince this must hold for all $x$, we have $D = 0$. Thus, $T(t) = C\\cos(2\\pi t)$.\n\nFinally, the solution is given by the product of $X(x)$ and $T(t)$:\n\n$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t) = \\cos(\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi t)$\n\nThis is the solution for $t > 0$ and $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$."
