    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Cholesky decomposition, we first need to check if the given matrix is symmetric and positive definite. The matrix A is:\n\nA = | 1  2  3 |\n    | 2  5  5 |\n    | 3  5  6 |\n\nThe matrix A is symmetric. Now, let's check if it's positive definite:\n\n1. The determinant of the first principal minor is det(A1) = 1 > 0.\n2. The determinant of the second principal minor is det(A2) = | 1  2 |\n                                                               | 2  5 | = 1 * 5 - 2 * 2 = 1 > 0.\n3. The determinant of the third principal minor is det(A3) = | 1  2  3 |\n                                                               | 2  5  5 |\n                                                               | 3  5  6 | = 1(5*6 - 5*5) - 2(2*6 - 3*5) + 3(2*5 - 3*5) = 1 > 0.\n\nSince all the principal minors have positive determinants, the matrix A is positive definite. Now we can proceed with the Cholesky decomposition.\n\nStep 1: Find the Cholesky factor L\nWe need to find a lower triangular matrix L such that A = L * L^T. The elements of L can be calculated as follows:\n\nl11 = √a11 = √1 = 1\nl21 = a21 / l11 = 2 / 1 = 2\nl31 = a31 / l11 = 3 / 1 = 3\nl22 = √(a22 - l21^2) = √(5 - 2^2) = √1 = 1\nl32 = (a32 - l31 * l21) / l22 = (5 - 3 * 2) / 1 = -1\nl33 = √(a33 - l31^2 - l32^2) = √(6 - 3^2 - (-1)^2) = √2\n\nSo, the lower triangular matrix L is:\n\nL = |  1  0  0 |\n     |  2  1  0 |\n     |  3 -1  √2 |\n\nStep 2: Solve L * Y = B for Y\nThe matrix B is:\n\nB = | 14 |\n     | 32 |\n     | 40 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the system L * Y = B:\n\n|  1  0  0 | | y1 |   | 14 |\n|  2  1  0 | | y2 | = | 32 |\n|  3 -1  √2 | | y3 |   | 40 |\n\nFrom the first equation, y1 = 14.\nFrom the second equation, 2 * y1 + y2 = 32 => y2 = 32 - 2 * 14 = 4.\nFrom the third equation, 3 * y1 - y2 + √2 * y3 = 40 => y3 = (40 - 3 * 14 + 4) / √2 = 2.\n\nSo, Y = | 14 |\n          |  4 |\n          |  2 |\n\nStep 3: Solve L^T * X = Y for X\nNow, we need to solve the system L^T * X = Y:\n\n|  1  2  3 | | x1 |   | 14 |\n|  0  1 -1 | | x2 | = |  4 |\n|  0  0  √2 | | x3 |   |  2 |\n\nFrom the third equation, x3 = 2 / √2 = √2.\nFrom the second equation, x2 + x3 = 4 => x2 = 4 - √2.\nFrom the first equation, x1 + 2 * x2 + 3 * x3 = 14 => x1 = 14 - 2 * (4 - √2) - 3 * √2 = 2.\n\nSo, the solution X is:\n\nX = |  2  |\n      | 4-√2 |\n      |  √2  |\n\nThus, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 2, y = 4 - √2, and z = √2."
