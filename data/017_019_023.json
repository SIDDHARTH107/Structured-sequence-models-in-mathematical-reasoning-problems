    "message_2": "There are four non-isomorphic groups of order 36. They are:\n\n1. Cyclic group C_36\n2. Direct product of two cyclic groups C_9 x C_4\n3. Direct product of two cyclic groups C_3 x C_12\n4. The semi-direct product of C_9 and C_4, also known as the Quaternion group of order 36.\n\nThese groups are non-isomorphic, meaning they have different structures and cannot be transformed into one another."
