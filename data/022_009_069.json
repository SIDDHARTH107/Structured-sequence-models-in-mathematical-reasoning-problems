    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of a series is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left|\\frac{\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n+2)z^{n+2}}}{\\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+1)z^{n+1}}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left|\\frac{(n+1)z^{n+1}}{(n+2)z^{n+2}}\\right| = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left|\\frac{n+1}{n+2}\\right| \\cdot \\left|\\frac{1}{z}\\right|$$\n\nSince the limit of the first part as n approaches infinity is 1, we have:\n\n$$1 \\cdot \\left|\\frac{1}{z}\\right| < 1$$\n\nThus, the radius of convergence R is:\n\n$$R = \\left|\\frac{1}{z}\\right| > 1 \\Rightarrow |z| < 1$$\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints to find the interval of convergence. Let's check z = 1 and z = -1:\n\nFor z = 1, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}$$\n\nThis is an alternating series, and since the limit of the terms as n approaches infinity is 0 and the terms are decreasing, the series converges by the Alternating Series Test.\n\nFor z = -1, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n+1}$$\n\nThis is the harmonic series, which is known to diverge.\n\nTherefore, the interval of convergence is:\n\n$$-1 < z \\le 1$$"
