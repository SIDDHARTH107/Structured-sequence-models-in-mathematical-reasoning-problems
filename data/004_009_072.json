    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x) * cos(x) - x * sin(x), we will use the product rule and the chain rule.\n\nThe product rule states that the derivative of two functions multiplied together is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function.\n\nLet u(x) = x^2 + 3x and v(x) = cos(x). Then, f(x) = u(x) * v(x) - x * sin(x).\n\nUsing the product rule, we get:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x) * v(x) + u(x) * v'(x) - x * sin'(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of u(x), v(x), and sin(x):\n\nu'(x) = 2x + 3 (using the power rule and sum rule)\nv'(x) = -sin(x) (derivative of cos(x))\nsin'(x) = cos(x) (derivative of sin(x))\n\nNow, substitute these derivatives back into the equation for f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = (2x + 3) * cos(x) + (x^2 + 3x) * (-sin(x)) - x * cos(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = (2 * 2 + 3) * cos(2) + (2^2 + 3 * 2) * (-sin(2)) - 2 * cos(2)\n\nf'(2) = (7) * cos(2) + (10) * (-sin(2)) - 2 * cos(2)\n\nf'(2) = 5 * cos(2) - 10 * sin(2)\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = (x^2 + 3x) * cos(x) - x * sin(x) at x = 2 is f'(2) = 5 * cos(2) - 10 * sin(2)."
