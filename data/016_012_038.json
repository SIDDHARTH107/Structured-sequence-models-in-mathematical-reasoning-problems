    "message_2": "To find the length of the Peano curve of order 2, we first need to understand the construction of the curve.\n\nThe Peano curve is a space-filling curve, meaning it covers the entire 2D space within a square. In the first order, the curve is divided into 3 equal parts and folded into a zig-zag shape. In the second order, each of these segments is further divided into 3 equal parts and folded into a zig-zag shape.\n\nIn the first order, the length of the Peano curve is 3 times the length of the original straight line segment (since it is divided into 3 equal parts). Let's assume the length of the original straight line segment is L.\n\nFor the second order, each of these 3 segments is further divided into 3 equal parts, resulting in a total of 9 segments. Each of these 9 segments is then folded into a zig-zag shape, so the length of the Peano curve of order 2 is 9 times the length of the original straight line segment.\n\nTherefore, the length of the Peano curve of order 2 is 9L."
