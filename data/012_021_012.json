    "message_2": "The treewidth of a complete graph K5 is 4.\n\nIn general, the treewidth of a complete graph Kn is n-1. This is because a tree decomposition of a complete graph can be formed by creating a bag for each vertex and including all its neighbors in the bag. Since each vertex in a complete graph has n-1 neighbors, the treewidth is n-1."
