    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, which is denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {4, 5, 6}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ B = {4}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of set A, denoted as A'. The complement of a set A is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in A. Since the universal set is not provided, we can assume it to be the union of A and B, which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nA' = {5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A ∆ B) and A':\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ A' = ({1, 2, 3, 5, 6}) ∆ ({5, 6})\n\n(A ∆ B) ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}\n(A ∆ B) ∩ A' = {5, 6}\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ A' = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A and A':\n\nA ∆ A' = ({1, 2, 3, 4}) ∆ ({5, 6})\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nA ∩ A' = {}\n\nA ∆ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A':\n\nB ∆ A' = ({4, 5, 6}) ∆ ({5, 6})\n\nB ∪ A' = {4, 5, 6}\nB ∩ A' = {5, 6}\n\nB ∆ A' = {4}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is distributive over complement:\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ A' = A ∆ (B ∆ A')\n\n{1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ∆ {4}\n\nThis is not true, as the symmetric difference of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and {4} is {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}, not {1, 2, 3}. Therefore, the symmetric difference is not distributive over complement."
