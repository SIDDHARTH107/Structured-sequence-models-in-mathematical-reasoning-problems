The following table gives the number of patients who survived and the number of patients who died at the end of each of the first 12 months after surgery:\n\n| Months after surgery | Number of patients who survived | Number of patients who died |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 56 | 4 |\n| 2 | 54 | 6 |\n| 3 | 50 | 10 |\n| 4 | 47 | 13 |\n| 5 | 42 | 18 |\n| 6 | 38 | 22 |\n| 7 | 34 | 26 |\n| 8 | 30 | 30 |\n| 9 | 25 | 35 |\n| 10 | 22 | 38 |\n| 11 | 19 | 41 |\n| 12 | 16 | 44 |\n\nUsing the Kaplan-Meier estimator, what is the estimated probability that a heart transplant patient will survive at least 8 months after surgery?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the Kaplan-Meier estimator, we will use the formula:\n\nS(t) = (number of patients at risk at time t - number of patients who died at time t) / (number of patients at risk at time t)\n\nWe will then multiply the survival probabilities at each time point up to 8 months.\n\nS(1) = (56 - 4) / 56 = 52 / 56\nS(2) = (54 - 6) / 54 = 48 / 54\nS(3) = (50 - 10) / 50 = 40 / 50\nS(4) = (47 - 13) / 47 = 34 / 47\nS(5) = (42 - 18) / 42 = 24 / 42\nS(6) = (38 - 22) / 38 = 16 / 38\nS(7) = (34 - 26) / 34 = 8 / 34\nS(8) = (30 - 30) / 30 = 0 / 30\n\nNow, we will multiply the survival probabilities at each time point up to 8 months:\n\nS(8) = (52/56) * (48/54) * (40/50) * (34/47) * (24/42) * (16/38) * (8/34) * (0/30)\n\nS(8) = 0\n\nThe estimated probability that a heart transplant patient will survive at least 8 months after surgery is 0, which means none of the patients survived past 8 months."
