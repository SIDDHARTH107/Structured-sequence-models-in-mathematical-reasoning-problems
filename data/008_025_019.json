    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method.\n\nFirst, we can observe that the second equation is a multiple of the first equation. If we divide the second equation by 2, we get:\n\n2x + 3y = 4.5\n\nNow, we can subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:\n\n(2x + 3y) - (2x + 3y) = 4.5 - 5\n0 = -0.5\n\nSince this statement is false (0 is not equal to -0.5), the system of linear equations has no solution. The two lines represented by the equations are parallel and do not intersect."
