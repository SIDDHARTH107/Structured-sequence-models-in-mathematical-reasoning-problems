    "message_1": "What is the period of oscillation of a Duffing oscillator with the following parameters?\n\n$$m = 1, \\quad \\gamma = 0.4, \\quad k = 1, \\quad F_0 = 0.5, \\quad \\omega = 1.2$$\n\nNote: The Duffing oscillator is described by the differential equation: \n\n$$m \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{dx}{dt} + kx + \\alpha x^3 = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$$\n\nwhere $m$ is the mass, $\\gamma$ is the damping coefficient, $k$ is the linear stiffness coefficient, $\\alpha$ is the non-linear stiffness coefficient, $F_0$ is the amplitude of the driving force, $\\omega$ is the frequency of the driving force, and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.",
    "message_2": "The period of oscillation of a Duffing oscillator cannot be determined analytically using a simple formula, as it is a non-linear system. To find the period of oscillation, one would need to numerically solve the given differential equation and analyze the resulting time series of the displacement $x(t)$. \n\nHowever, you have not provided the value of the non-linear stiffness coefficient $\\alpha$, which is necessary to solve the differential equation. Please provide the value of $\\alpha$ to proceed with the numerical solution."
