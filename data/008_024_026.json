    "message_1": "Suppose you have the system of linear equations:\n\nx + 2y - z = 3\n\n2x - 4y + 2z = -6\n\n-3x + 6y - 3z = 9\n\nDetermine a value for x, y, and z that satisfies all three equations, or explain why no such solution exists.",
    "message_2": "First, we can simplify the system of linear equations by dividing the second equation by 2 and the third equation by -3:\n\nx + 2y - z = 3\n\nx - 2y + z = -3\n\nx - 2y + z = -3\n\nNow, we can see that the second and third equations are the same. This means that we can eliminate one of them and work with the remaining two equations:\n\nx + 2y - z = 3\n\nx - 2y + z = -3\n\nNow, we can solve for x by adding the two equations:\n\n(x + 2y - z) + (x - 2y + z) = 3 + (-3)\n\n2x = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into the first equation to solve for y and z:\n\n0 + 2y - z = 3\n\n2y - z = 3\n\nAnd substitute x back into the second equation:\n\n0 - 2y + z = -3\n\n-2y + z = -3\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n2y - z = 3\n\n-2y + z = -3\n\nWe can add the two equations to eliminate y:\n\n(2y - z) + (-2y + z) = 3 + (-3)\n\n0 = 0\n\nSince we end up with an equation that is always true (0 = 0), this means that there are infinitely many solutions for y and z that would satisfy the system of linear equations. The value of x is fixed at 0, but y and z can be any values that satisfy 2y - z = 3."
