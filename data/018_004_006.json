    "message_2": "The complement of a set S, denoted by S', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in S. In this case, the universal set U is the set of all integers from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. The set S is the set of even numbers from 2 to 10, i.e., S = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}.\n\nTo find the complement of S, we need to find all the elements in U that are not in S. We can do this by comparing the elements of U and S:\n\n1. The number 1 is not in S, so it is in the complement of S.\n2. The number 2 is in S, so it is not in the complement of S.\n3. The number 3 is not in S, so it is in the complement of S.\n4. The number 4 is in S, so it is not in the complement of S.\n5. The number 5 is not in S, so it is in the complement of S.\n6. The number 6 is in S, so it is not in the complement of S.\n7. The number 7 is not in S, so it is in the complement of S.\n8. The number 8 is in S, so it is not in the complement of S.\n9. The number 9 is not in S, so it is in the complement of S.\n10. The number 10 is in S, so it is not in the complement of S.\n\nThus, the complement of S, denoted by S', is the set of all odd numbers from 1 to 9, i.e., S' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nTo prove that the complement of S is unique, we need to show that there is no other set that can be the complement of S. Let's assume there is another set T that is also the complement of S. Since T is the complement of S, it must contain all the elements in U that are not in S, which are the odd numbers from 1 to 9. Therefore, T = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. But this is exactly the same as the set S', which means that T and S' are the same set. This contradicts our assumption that there is another set T that is different from S'. Therefore, the complement of S is unique, and it is the set S' = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}."
