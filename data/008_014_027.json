    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using the QR decomposition method, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  1 |      x = | x |      b = |  7  |\n    | 3 -4  5 |          | y |          | -1  |\n    | 1 -2  1 |          | z |          |  0  |\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a method of decomposing a matrix A into a product of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R, such that A = QR.\n\nUsing a QR decomposition calculator or software (such as Python's NumPy library), we find:\n\nQ = | -0.53  0.63 -0.57 |      R = | -3.74 -1.59  4.43 |\n    | -0.80 -0.48  0.36 |          |  0    4.48  0.95 |\n    | -0.27  0.60  0.75 |          |  0     0   -1.14 |\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation Rx = Q^Tb for x. First, we compute Q^Tb:\n\nQ^Tb = | -0.53  -0.80  -0.27 | |  7  | = |  1.60 |\n       |  0.63  -0.48   0.60 | | -1  |   |  5.74 |\n       | -0.57   0.36   0.75 | |  0  |   | -0.57 |\n\nNow, we solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^Tb using back substitution:\n\nR = | -3.74 -1.59  4.43 |      x = | x |      Q^Tb = |  1.60 |\n    |  0    4.48  0.95 |          | y |              |  5.74 |\n    |  0     0   -1.14 |          | z |              | -0.57 |\n\nFrom the third row of R, we have -1.14z = -0.57, which gives z = 0.50.\n\nNow, substituting z back into the second row of R, we get 4.48y + 0.95(0.50) = 5.74, which gives y = 1.00.\n\nFinally, substituting y and z back into the first row of R, we get -3.74x - 1.59(1.00) + 4.43(0.50) = 1.60, which gives x = 1.00.\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1.00, y = 1.00, and z = 0.50."
