    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = (3z^2 + 2)/(z^3 - 2z^2 + 4z - 3) at the pole z = 1, we first need to determine the order of the pole. We can do this by factoring the denominator and finding the multiplicity of the factor (z - 1).\n\nThe denominator can be factored as follows:\n\nz^3 - 2z^2 + 4z - 3 = (z - 1)(z^2 - z + 3)\n\nNow we can see that the pole z = 1 has order 1, as the factor (z - 1) appears only once.\n\nSince the pole has order 1, we can find the residue by taking the derivative of the denominator and evaluating the limit as z approaches 1:\n\nResidue = lim (z -> 1) [(3z^2 + 2)(z - 1)] / [(z^2 - z + 3)]\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit:\n\nResidue = [(3(1)^2 + 2)(1 - 1)] / [(1^2 - 1 + 3)] = 0\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) at the pole z = 1 is 0."
