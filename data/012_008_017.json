    "message_2": "To find the number of regions in a planar graph, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of regions (faces).\n\nWe are given that the graph has 12 vertices, each with a degree of 3. The sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges (since each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices). Therefore, we have:\n\n3 * 12 = 2 * E\n\nE = 18\n\nNow we can plug the values of V and E into Euler's formula:\n\n12 - 18 + F = 2\n\nF = 8\n\nSo, there are 8 regions in the planar graph with 12 vertices, where each vertex has a degree of 3."
