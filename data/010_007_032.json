Suppose $p: \\tilde{X} \\rightarrow X$ is a covering map where $\\tilde{X}$ is a connected and locally path-connected space. Let $\\pi_1(X,x_0)$ denote the fundamental group of $X$ at $x_0$ and let $G=p_*(\\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x_0}))$ denote the image of the induced homomorphism $p_*: \\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x_0}) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(X,x_0)$. \n\nDetermine the order of the group $G$ if $\\pi_1(X,x_0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $p$ is a degree-3 covering map.",
    "message_2": "Since $p$ is a degree-3 covering map, for each point $x \\in X$, there are exactly 3 points in $\\tilde{X}$ that map to $x$ under $p$. Now, consider the induced homomorphism $p_*: \\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x_0}) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(X,x_0)$. We are given that $\\pi_1(X,x_0) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe group $G = p_*(\\pi_1(\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x_0}))$ is a subgroup of $\\pi_1(X,x_0)$. Since $\\pi_1(X,x_0)$ has order 2, its only possible subgroups are the trivial group (order 1) and itself (order 2).\n\nNow, we know that the covering map $p$ is a degree-3 covering map, which means that the fibers of $p$ have 3 elements. If $G$ were the trivial group, then the covering map would be a trivial covering, which is not the case. Therefore, $G$ must be equal to $\\pi_1(X,x_0)$, and the order of $G$ is 2."
