    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the objective function that is guaranteed regardless of the uncertain coefficients, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for each constraint. We will do this by finding the lower and upper bounds for each constraint and then solving the optimization problem.\n\n1. Constraint 1: x + 2y <= 5\n   Lower bound: 1.1x + 2.9y <= 4.9\n   Upper bound: 0.9x + 3.1y <= 5.1\n\n2. Constraint 2: 3x + 4y >= 6\n   Lower bound: 2.9x + 3.9y >= 5.9\n   Upper bound: 3.1x + 4.1y >= 6.1\n\n3. Constraint 3: x - y = 1\n   Lower bound: 1.1x - 1.1y = 0.9\n   Upper bound: 0.9x - 0.9y = 1.1\n\nNow, we need to solve the optimization problem with these new constraints:\n\nmaximize 1.9x + 2.9y\n\nsubject to\n1.1x + 2.9y <= 4.9\n0.9x + 3.1y <= 5.1\n2.9x + 3.9y >= 5.9\n3.1x + 4.1y >= 6.1\n1.1x - 1.1y = 0.9\n0.9x - 0.9y = 1.1\n\nWe can solve this problem graphically by plotting the feasible region and finding the vertex that maximizes the objective function. After plotting the feasible region, we find that the vertices of the feasible region are approximately:\n\nA: (1.76, 1.47)\nB: (1.96, 0.99)\nC: (1.36, 1.97)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function at each of these vertices:\n\nA: 1.9(1.76) + 2.9(1.47) ≈ 8.34\nB: 1.9(1.96) + 2.9(0.99) ≈ 7.82\nC: 1.9(1.36) + 2.9(1.97) ≈ 8.44\n\nThe maximum value of the objective function that is guaranteed, regardless of the uncertain coefficients, under these constraints is approximately 8.34."
