    "message_2": "To find the cardinality of the set containing all even natural numbers between 2 and 100, inclusive, we can use the formula for finding the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence:\n\nNumber of terms = (last term - first term) / common difference + 1\n\nIn this case, the first term is 2, the last term is 100, and the common difference is 2 (since we are considering even numbers).\n\nNumber of terms = (100 - 2) / 2 + 1 = 98 / 2 + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50\n\nSo, the cardinality of the set containing all even natural numbers between 2 and 100, inclusive, is 50."
