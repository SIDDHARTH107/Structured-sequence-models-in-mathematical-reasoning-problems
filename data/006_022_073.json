The probability of a student participating in music and sports is 0.6, while the probability of a student participating in only music is 0.25. What is the probability of a student participating in only sports?",
    "message_2": "Let P(M) be the probability of a student participating in music, P(S) be the probability of a student participating in sports, P(M ∩ S) be the probability of a student participating in both music and sports, and P(M ∪ S) be the probability of a student participating in either music or sports.\n\nWe are given that P(M ∩ S) = 0.6 and P(M) = 0.25. We want to find P(S) - P(M ∩ S), which is the probability of a student participating in only sports.\n\nFirst, we need to find P(M ∪ S). Since every student participates in at least one of the activities, P(M ∪ S) = 1.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(M ∪ S) = P(M) + P(S) - P(M ∩ S)\n\n1 = 0.25 + P(S) - 0.6\n\n1 = P(S) - 0.35\n\nP(S) = 1 + 0.35\n\nP(S) = 1.35\n\nNow, we can find the probability of a student participating in only sports:\n\nP(only sports) = P(S) - P(M ∩ S)\n\nP(only sports) = 1.35 - 0.6\n\nP(only sports) = 0.75\n\nSo, the probability of a student participating in only sports is 0.75."
