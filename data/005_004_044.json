They randomly select 30 stores and assign each store to one of the three strategies. The table below shows the sales of each store over a week. \n\n| Strategy 1 | Strategy 2  | Strategy 3  |\n|---|---|---|\n| 100 | 115 | 95 |\n| 95 | 110 | 100 |\n| 105 | 115 | 105 |\n| 110 | 120 | 100 |\n| 98 | 112 | 102 |\n\nWhat is the F-statistic for this ANOVA test?

    "message_2": "To calculate the F-statistic for this ANOVA test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of each group (strategy).\n2. Calculate the overall mean.\n3. Calculate the Sum of Squares Between groups (SSB) and Sum of Squares Within groups (SSW).\n4. Calculate the Mean Square Between (MSB) and Mean Square Within (MSW).\n5. Calculate the F-statistic.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean of each group (strategy).\n\nStrategy 1 mean = (100 + 95 + 105 + 110 + 98) / 5 = 101.6\nStrategy 2 mean = (115 + 110 + 115 + 120 + 112) / 5 = 114.4\nStrategy 3 mean = (95 + 100 + 105 + 100 + 102) / 5 = 100.4\n\nStep 2: Calculate the overall mean.\n\nOverall mean = (101.6 + 114.4 + 100.4) / 3 = 105.467\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Sum of Squares Between groups (SSB) and Sum of Squares Within groups (SSW).\n\nSSB = Σ(n * (group mean - overall mean)^2)\nSSB = 5 * ((101.6 - 105.467)^2 + (114.4 - 105.467)^2 + (100.4 - 105.467)^2) = 5 * (14.987 + 79.947 + 25.467) = 600.005\n\nSSW = ΣΣ(x_ij - group mean)^2\nSSW = (100 - 101.6)^2 + (95 - 101.6)^2 + ... + (102 - 100.4)^2 = 50 + 42.25 + ... + 2.56 = 188.56\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Mean Square Between (MSB) and Mean Square Within (MSW).\n\nMSB = SSB / (number of groups - 1) = 600.005 / (3 - 1) = 300.0025\nMSW = SSW / (total number of observations - number of groups) = 188.56 / (15 - 3) = 23.57\n\nStep 5: Calculate the F-statistic.\n\nF-statistic = MSB / MSW = 300.0025 / 23.57 = 12.73\n\nThe F-statistic for this ANOVA test is 12.73."
