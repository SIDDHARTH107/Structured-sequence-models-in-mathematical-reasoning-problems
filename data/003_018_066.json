    "message_2": "To find the derivative of y = sin(x) at x = pi/4, we first need to find the derivative of sin(x) with respect to x. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x). Now, we need to evaluate the derivative at x = pi/4:\n\ncos(pi/4) = √2/2\n\nSo, the derivative of y = sin(x) at x = pi/4 is √2/2."
