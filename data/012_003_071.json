    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them). The size of the maximum independent set is the largest number of vertices that can be chosen such that no two vertices are adjacent.\n\nIn a graph with 10 vertices, the size of the maximum independent set depends on the structure of the graph. In the worst case, all vertices are connected to each other (a complete graph), and the maximum independent set size is 1 (any single vertex). In the best case, the graph is an empty graph (no edges), and the maximum independent set size is 10 (all vertices).\n\nWithout more information about the structure of the graph, it is impossible to provide the size of the maximum independent set or the set of vertices that form this maximum independent set."
