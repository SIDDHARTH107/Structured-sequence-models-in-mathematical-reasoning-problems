    "message_1": "Suppose that a group of 20 students took a math quiz and received the following scores: 12, 14, 15, 15, 16, 16, 17, 17, 18, 18, 19, 19, 19, 20, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, and 27. Calculate the median and the interquartile range of the scores.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the median, we first need to find the middle value of the dataset. Since there are 20 students, the middle values are the 10th and 11th scores. In this case, the 10th score is 18 and the 11th score is 19. The median is the average of these two values:\n\nMedian = (18 + 19) / 2 = 18.5\n\nTo calculate the interquartile range (IQR), we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Q1 is the median of the lower half of the dataset, and Q3 is the median of the upper half of the dataset.\n\nFor Q1, the lower half of the dataset consists of the first 10 scores: 12, 14, 15, 15, 16, 16, 17, 17, 18, and 18. Since there are 10 scores, the middle values are the 5th and 6th scores, which are both 16. So, Q1 = 16.\n\nFor Q3, the upper half of the dataset consists of the last 10 scores: 19, 19, 19, 20, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, and 27. The middle values are the 5th and 6th scores, which are both 20. So, Q3 = 20.\n\nNow, we can calculate the interquartile range:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = 20 - 16 = 4\n\nSo, the median of the scores is 18.5, and the interquartile range is 4."
