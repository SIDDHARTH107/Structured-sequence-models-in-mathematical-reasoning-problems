    "message_2": "An independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. To find the maximum size of an independent set in this graph, we need to select the maximum number of vertices without selecting any adjacent vertices.\n\nIn the given graph, we can select vertices A, C, and E, which are not adjacent to each other. There is no way to select more than 3 vertices without selecting adjacent vertices.\n\nTherefore, the maximum size of an independent set in this graph is 3."
