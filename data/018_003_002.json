    "message_2": "A superset of a set is a set that contains all the elements of the original set and possibly additional elements. Let's find the superset of set A and set B.\n\nSuperset of set A (denoted as S_A) must contain all elements of A: {1, 2, 3, 4} and possibly additional elements. For example, S_A could be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} or {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8} or even the set of all integers.\n\nSimilarly, the superset of set B (denoted as S_B) must contain all elements of B: {3, 4, 5} and possibly additional elements. For example, S_B could be {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} or {3, 4, 5, 8, 9} or even the set of all integers.\n\nNow, let's find the union of sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B. The union of two sets is a set containing all elements from both sets, without repetition.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, we need to show that the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B) is a superset of each of the individual sets (A and B).\n\nA ⊆ (A ∪ B) because all elements of A are in (A ∪ B): {1, 2, 3, 4} ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB ⊆ (A ∪ B) because all elements of B are in (A ∪ B): {3, 4, 5} ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSince all elements of A and B are included in the union (A ∪ B), we can conclude that the union of sets A and B is a superset of each of the individual sets A and B."
