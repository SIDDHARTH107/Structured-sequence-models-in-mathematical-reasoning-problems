How many connected components does the graph have after removing the cut vertices and bridges?",
    "message_2": "In the given graph, the cut vertices are B and E. A cut vertex is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nThe bridges in the graph are the edges (A, B), (B, C), and (E, G). A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nAfter removing the cut vertices (B and E) and bridges ((A, B), (B, C), and (E, G)), the graph will be divided into the following connected components:\n\n1. Vertex A\n2. Vertex D\n3. Vertex C\n4. Vertex F\n5. Vertex G\n\nSo, there will be 5 connected components after removing the cut vertices and bridges."
