    "message_2": "To compute the Hodge star operator, we first need to find the volume form of the manifold M. The volume form is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times the standard volume form in 3D, which is dx ∧ dy ∧ dz. The metric tensor G for the given metric g is:\n\nG = | 1  0  0 |\n      | 0  1  0 |\n      | 0  0  4 |\n\nThe determinant of G is det(G) = 1 * 1 * 4 = 4. Therefore, the volume form is:\n\nvol(M) = √4 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz = 2 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge star operator for the given 3-form. In 3-dimensional space, the Hodge star operator of the volume form is 1:\n\n* (2 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz) = 1\n\nSo, the Hodge star operator *dx ∧ *dy ∧ *dz at the point (1, 2, 3) on the manifold M is 1."
