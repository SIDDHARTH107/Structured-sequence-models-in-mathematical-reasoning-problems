    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the surface, we first need to compute the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric tensor for the given metric is:\n\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 9\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe determinant of the metric tensor is:\n\n$$\n\\det(g) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 9\n\\end{pmatrix} = 4 \\cdot 9 - 0 \\cdot 0 = 36\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the square root of the determinant:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{36} = 6\n$$\n\nThe volume form of the surface is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times the differential 2-form:\n\n$$\n\\text{vol} = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\wedge dy = 6 \\, dx \\wedge dy\n$$\n\nSo, the volume form of the surface is $6 \\, dx \\wedge dy$."
