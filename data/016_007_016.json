    "message_2": "The Menger sponge is a fractal that is created by iteratively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the whole structure are removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes after the first iteration.\n\nFor the 4th iteration, we can calculate the total number of cubes using the formula:\n\nTotal number of cubes = 20^n\n\nwhere n is the iteration number.\n\nSo, for the 4th iteration:\n\nTotal number of cubes = 20^4 = 160,000"
