What is the probability that both a phishing attack and a ransomware attack occur in the same week on this network?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of both events occurring in the same week, we can multiply the individual probabilities together.\n\nProbability of phishing attack = 0.2\nProbability of ransomware attack = 0.1\n\nProbability of both attacks occurring in the same week = 0.2 * 0.1 = 0.02\n\nSo, the probability of both a phishing attack and a ransomware attack occurring in the same week on this network is 0.02 or 2%."
