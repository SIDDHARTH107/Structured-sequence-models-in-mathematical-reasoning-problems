    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a matching in which every vertex of the graph is connected to exactly one edge of the matching. In other words, every vertex is paired with another vertex, and no vertex is left unconnected.\n\nIn this graph, we have 6 vertices: A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n\nTo check if there's a perfect matching, we can try to find a pairing of vertices that covers all vertices without any overlaps.\n\nOne possible perfect matching for this graph is:\n\n- Pair A with B (edge AB)\n- Pair C with D (edge CD)\n- Pair E with F (edge EF)\n\nSo, the graph G has a perfect matching, and the edges that form the perfect matching are AB, CD, and EF."
