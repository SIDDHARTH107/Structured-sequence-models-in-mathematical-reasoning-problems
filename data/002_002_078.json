    "message_2": "The formula to find the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius.\n\nGiven the radius r = 5 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5)^3\nV = (4/3)π(125)\nV ≈ 523.6 cubic centimeters\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the volume of the sphere is approximately 524 cubic centimeters."
