    "message_1": "A company wants to create a team of 9 employees to work on a new project. However, there are 15 eligible employees, and the company wants to ensure that each team will have exactly 3 members. How many teams can the company make?",
    "message_2": "The problem seems to be a bit contradictory. If the company wants to create a team of 9 employees, then it should not be divided into smaller teams of 3 members each. However, I will provide solutions for both cases.\n\nCase 1: A team of 9 employees from 15 eligible employees.\nTo find the number of ways to choose 9 employees from 15, we use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n = 15 (total number of eligible employees) and k = 9 (number of employees to be chosen).\n\nC(15, 9) = 15! / (9!(15-9)!)\nC(15, 9) = 15! / (9!6!)\nC(15, 9) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\nC(15, 9) = (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10) / (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\nC(15, 9) = 5005\n\nSo, the company can create 5005 different teams of 9 employees from the 15 eligible employees.\n\nCase 2: Three teams of 3 members each from 15 eligible employees.\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 employees from 15, then 3 employees from the remaining 12, and finally, 3 employees from the remaining 9.\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3!(15-3)!)\nC(15, 3) = 455\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3!(12-3)!)\nC(12, 3) = 220\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!(9-3)!)\nC(9, 3) = 84\n\nNow, we need to multiply the number of ways for each team selection:\n\nTotal number of ways = C(15, 3) × C(12, 3) × C(9, 3)\nTotal number of ways = 455 × 220 × 84\nTotal number of ways = 8,372,040\n\nHowever, since the order of the teams does not matter, we have overcounted the possibilities. We need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 3 teams, which is 3! (3 factorial) or 6.\n\nTotal number of ways = 8,372,040 / 6\nTotal number of ways = 1,395,340\n\nSo, the company can create 1,395,340 different sets of three teams with 3 members each from the 15 eligible employees."
