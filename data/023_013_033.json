The plate is exposed to a cooling atmosphere at a constant temperature of 20°C on one side.\n\nUse the Fourier transform method to find the temperature distribution T(x,t) on the plate at a later time t = 2 hours, assuming that the plate does not lose heat from the other surfaces. Assume that the thermal diffusivity of the metal is 1.2 x 10^-5 m^2/h.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat equation with the initial condition T(x, 0) = 100 + 50sin(3πx) and the boundary condition T(0, t) = 20°C. The heat equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere α is the thermal diffusivity of the metal (1.2 x 10^-5 m²/h in this case).\n\nFirst, we will find the Fourier transform of the initial condition:\n\nF(T(x, 0)) = F(100 + 50sin(3πx))\n\nSince the Fourier transform of a constant is a delta function and the Fourier transform of a sine function is a pair of delta functions, we have:\n\nF(T(x, 0)) = 100δ(k) + 25(δ(k - 3π) - δ(k + 3π))\n\nNow, we will find the solution of the heat equation in the frequency domain. The Fourier transform of the heat equation is:\n\n∂F(T)/∂t = -αk²F(T)\n\nThis is a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) with the solution:\n\nF(T(k, t)) = F(T(k, 0)) * exp(-αk²t)\n\nSubstituting the Fourier transform of the initial condition, we get:\n\nF(T(k, t)) = (100δ(k) + 25(δ(k - 3π) - δ(k + 3π))) * exp(-αk²t)\n\nNow, we will find the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the solution in the spatial domain:\n\nT(x, t) = F^(-1)(F(T(k, t)))\n\nUsing the inverse Fourier transform properties, we can write:\n\nT(x, t) = 100 * exp(-α(0)²t) + 25 * (exp(-α(3π)²t) * sin(3πx) - exp(-α(-3π)²t) * sin(-3πx))\n\nSince exp(-α(0)²t) = 1 and exp(-α(-3π)²t) = exp(-α(3π)²t), we can simplify the expression:\n\nT(x, t) = 100 + 50 * exp(-α(3π)²t) * sin(3πx)\n\nFinally, we will find the temperature distribution at t = 2 hours:\n\nT(x, 2) = 100 + 50 * exp(-1.2 x 10^-5 * (3π)² * 2) * sin(3πx)\n\nT(x, 2) = 100 + 50 * exp(-1.2 x 10^-5 * 18π² * 2) * sin(3πx)\n\nT(x, 2) = 100 + 50 * exp(-1.226 x 10^-3) * sin(3πx)\n\nT(x, 2) ≈ 100 + 49.4 * sin(3πx)\n\nSo, the temperature distribution T(x, t) on the plate at t = 2 hours is approximately:\n\nT(x, 2) ≈ 100 + 49.4 * sin(3πx)"
