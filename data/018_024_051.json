    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A∆B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA = {1, 2, 3}\nB = {2, 3, 4}\n\nIntersection of A and B, A∩B = {2, 3}\nA∆B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A∆B, denoted as (A∆B)'.\nAssuming the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B, U = {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n(A∆B)' = U - A∆B = {2, 3}\n\nNext, let's find the complements of A and B, denoted as A' and B'.\nA' = U - A = {4}\nB' = U - B = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B', denoted as A'∆B'.\nA'∆B' = {1, 4}\n\nNow, we can see that the symmetric difference of (A∆B) and its complement, (A∆B)' is {1, 4}, and the symmetric difference of the complements of A and B, A'∆B' is also {1, 4}. However, this does not prove that the operation is distributive over complement, as we need to show that (A∆B)' = A'∆B' for all sets A and B.\n\nLet's consider another example to show that the operation is not distributive over complement:\n\nLet A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}.\nA∆B = {1, 3}\n(A∆B)' = {2}\n\nA' = {3}\nB' = {1}\n\nA'∆B' = {1, 3}\n\nIn this case, (A∆B)' = {2} and A'∆B' = {1, 3}, which are not equal. Therefore, the symmetric difference operation is not distributive over complement."
