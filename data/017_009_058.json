    "message_2": "First, let's analyze the given group G with operation addition modulo 9. The operation is commutative, meaning that for any two elements a, b in G, a + b = b + a. This property makes the group G an abelian group.\n\nNow, let's consider the cyclic group C9. A cyclic group of order 9 is generated by a single element, say g, such that every element in the group can be expressed as a power of g. In this case, we can choose g = 1, as:\n\n1^0 = 0 (mod 9)\n1^1 = 1 (mod 9)\n1^2 = 2 (mod 9)\n1^3 = 3 (mod 9)\n1^4 = 4 (mod 9)\n1^5 = 5 (mod 9)\n1^6 = 6 (mod 9)\n1^7 = 7 (mod 9)\n1^8 = 8 (mod 9)\n\nThus, G is indeed a cyclic group generated by the element 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the non-abelian group of order 9. By definition, a non-abelian group has at least one pair of elements a, b such that a * b â‰  b * a, where * is the group operation. However, as we have already established that G is an abelian group, it cannot be isomorphic to a non-abelian group.\n\nIn conclusion, the group G with operation addition modulo 9 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9, but not to a non-abelian group of order 9."
