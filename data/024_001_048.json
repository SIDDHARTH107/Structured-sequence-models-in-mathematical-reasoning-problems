    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve r(t) = (2t, t^2, 3t^3) at t = 2, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of r(t) with respect to t.\n\nr'(t) = (2, 2t, 9t^2)\nr''(t) = (0, 2, 18t)\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these derivatives at t = 2:\n\nr'(2) = (2, 4, 36)\nr''(2) = (0, 2, 36)\n\nNext, we will find the curvature (k) using the formula:\n\nk = ||r'(t) x r''(t)|| / ||r'(t)||^3\n\nFirst, find the cross product of r'(t) and r''(t):\n\nr'(t) x r''(t) = (72, -72, 4)\n\nNow, find the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n||r'(t) x r''(t)|| = √(72^2 + (-72)^2 + 4^2) = √(10368)\n\nNext, find the magnitude of r'(t):\n\n||r'(2)|| = √(2^2 + 4^2 + 36^2) = √(1332)\n\nNow, we can find the curvature:\n\nk = √(10368) / (1332)^(3/2) ≈ 0.0283\n\nTo find the torsion (τ), we will use the formula:\n\nτ = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) / ||r'(t) x r''(t)||^2\n\nFirst, we need to find the third derivative of r(t):\n\nr'''(t) = (0, 0, 18)\n\nNow, evaluate it at t = 2:\n\nr'''(2) = (0, 0, 18)\n\nNext, find the dot product of the cross product and r'''(t):\n\n(r'(t) x r''(t)) • r'''(t) = (72, -72, 4) • (0, 0, 18) = 72\n\nFinally, find the torsion:\n\nτ = 72 / (10368) ≈ 0.0069\n\nSo, the curvature (k) at t = 2 is approximately 0.0283, and the torsion (τ) is approximately 0.0069."
