    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of operations to transform the augmented matrix into a row-echelon form.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\n1. x + y + z = 3\n2. 2x + 3y + 4z = 8\n3. 4x + 6y + 8z = 16\n\nThe augmented matrix for this system is:\n\n| 1  1  1 | 3 |\n| 2  3  4 | 8 |\n| 4  6  8 | 16|\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2*R1\nR3 = R3 - 4*R1\n\n| 1  1   1 |  3 |\n| 0  1   2 |  2 |\n| 0  2   4 |  4 |\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - 2*R2\n\n| 1  1   1 |  3 |\n| 0  1   2 |  2 |\n| 0  0   0 |  0 |\n\nNow, the matrix is in row-echelon form. We can see that the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 0, which is always true. This means that the system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nTo express the solution, we can rewrite the system of equations from the row-echelon form:\n\n1. x + y + z = 3\n2. y + 2z = 2\n\nNow, we can express z as a free variable:\n\nz = t, where t is any real number.\n\nFrom equation 2, we can express y in terms of z (or t):\n\ny = 2 - 2z = 2 - 2t\n\nFrom equation 1, we can express x in terms of y and z (or t):\n\nx = 3 - y - z = 3 - (2 - 2t) - t = 1 + t\n\nSo, the general solution of the system is:\n\nx = 1 + t\ny = 2 - 2t\nz = t\n\nwhere t is any real number."
