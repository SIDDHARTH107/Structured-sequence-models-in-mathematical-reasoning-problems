    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products: type A and type B. The production of each unit of type A requires 3 hours of labor, 2 hours of machine time, and 4 units of material, while the production of each unit of type B requires 6 hours of labor, 4 hours of machine time, and 2 units of material. The company has 30 hours of labor, 20 hours of machine time, and 25 units of material available each day. Each unit of type A yields a profit of $25, and each unit of type B yields a profit of $30. What is the maximum daily profit the company can earn from these products?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of type A produced and y be the number of units of type B produced. We are given the following constraints:\n\nLabor constraint: 3x + 6y ≤ 30\nMachine time constraint: 2x + 4y ≤ 20\nMaterial constraint: 4x + 2y ≤ 25\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 25x + 30y.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the constraints:\n\nLabor constraint: x + 2y ≤ 10\nMachine time constraint: x + 2y ≤ 10\nMaterial constraint: 2x + y ≤ 12.5\n\nSince the labor and machine time constraints are the same, we can focus on just one of them:\n\nx + 2y ≤ 10\n2x + y ≤ 12.5\n\nNow we need to find the feasible region for these constraints. We can start by finding the intercepts:\n\nx-intercept for labor/machine time constraint: x = 10, y = 0\ny-intercept for labor/machine time constraint: x = 0, y = 5\n\nx-intercept for material constraint: x = 6.25, y = 0\ny-intercept for material constraint: x = 0, y = 12.5\n\nNow we can find the intersection point of the two lines:\n\nx + 2y = 10\n2x + y = 12.5\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\n\nx = 5, y = 2.5\n\nHowever, since we can only produce whole units, we need to check the integer points in the feasible region. The feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (10, 0), (0, 5), and (5, 2.5). The integer points in this region are:\n\n(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0),\n(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1),\n(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2),\n(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3),\n(0, 4), (1, 4),\n(0, 5)\n\nNow we can evaluate the profit function at each of these points:\n\nP(0, 0) = 0\nP(1, 0) = 25\nP(2, 0) = 50\nP(3, 0) = 75\nP(4, 0) = 100\nP(5, 0) = 125\nP(6, 0) = 150\nP(7, 0) = 175\nP(8, 0) = 200\nP(9, 0) = 225\nP(10, 0) = 250\nP(0, 1) = 30\nP(1, 1) = 55\nP(2, 1) = 80\nP(3, 1) = 105\nP(4, 1) = 130\nP(5, 1) = 155\nP(0, 2) = 60\nP(1, 2) = 85\nP(2, 2) = 110\nP(3, 2) = 135\nP(4, 2) = 160\nP(0, 3) = 90\nP(1, 3) = 115\nP(2, 3) = 140\nP(0, 4) = 120\nP(1, 4) = 145\nP(0, 5) = 150\n\nThe maximum profit is $250, which occurs when the company produces 10 units of type A and 0 units of type B."
