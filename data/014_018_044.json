    "message_1": "A substitution cipher replaces each letter in a message with a different letter of the alphabet. Suppose that a message encrypted using a substitution cipher has a frequency distribution of letters that looks like this:\n\n| Letter | Frequency |\n|--------|-----------|\n| A      | 0.08      |\n| B      | 0.05      |\n| C      | 0.12      |\n| D      | 0.05      |\n| E      | 0.20      |\n| F      | 0.08      |\n| G      | 0.02      |\n| H      | 0.04      |\n| I      | 0.05      |\n| J      | 0.00      |\n| K      | 0.02      |\n| L      | 0.05      |\n| M      | 0.12      |\n| N      | 0.05      |\n| O      | 0.08      |\n| P      | 0.02      |\n| Q      | 0.00      |\n| R      | 0.02      |\n| S      | 0.05      |\n| T      | 0.05      |\n| U      | 0.02      |\n| V      | 0.00      |\n| W      | 0.02      |\n| X      | 0.00      |\n| Y      | 0.00      |\n| Z      | 0.00      |\n\nAssuming that the plaintext message is in English and that the most common letter in English is E (which has a frequency of approximately 0.127), which letter(s) in the frequency distribution are likely to correspond to E in the plaintext message?",
    "message_2": "In the given frequency distribution, the letter with the highest frequency is E with a frequency of 0.20. Since E is the most common letter in English with a frequency of approximately 0.127, it is likely that the letter E in the encrypted message corresponds to the letter E in the plaintext message."
