    "message_1": "A pizza delivery person wants to deliver from point A to point B, passing through points C, D, E and F, minimizing the distance travelled. The distance between point A and C is 10km, C and D is 5km, D and E is 8km, E and F is 6km, and F and B is 12km. What is the optimal routing for the pizza delivery person to take?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal routing for the pizza delivery person, we need to find the shortest path that passes through all the points in the order A, C, D, E, F, and B. \n\nSince the problem is already giving us the order in which the points need to be visited, we just need to add up the distances between each pair of consecutive points.\n\nThe optimal routing for the pizza delivery person is A → C → D → E → F → B.\n\nThe total distance travelled will be:\n\nA to C: 10 km\nC to D: 5 km\nD to E: 8 km\nE to F: 6 km\nF to B: 12 km\n\nTotal distance = 10 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 12 = 41 km\n\nSo, the optimal routing for the pizza delivery person is A → C → D → E → F → B, and the total distance travelled will be 41 km."
