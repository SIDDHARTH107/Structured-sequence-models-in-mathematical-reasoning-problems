    "message_2": "The perimeter of a circle, also known as the circumference, is calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nGiven a radius of 6 cm, we can calculate the circumference as follows:\n\nC = 2π(6 cm)\nC ≈ 2 × 3.14 × 6 cm\nC ≈ 37.68 cm\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the perimeter of the circle is approximately 37.68 cm."
