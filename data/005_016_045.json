    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces three types of products: A, B, and C. The company wants to classify future products based on two numerical variables, the weight and the length. A discriminant analysis has been conducted using a sample of 50 products, and it yielded the following discriminant function:\n\nD = 0.2W + 0.5L - 15\n\nWhere D is the discriminant score, W is the weight (in pounds), and L is the length (in inches). \n\nIf a new product weighs 10 pounds and has a length of 30 inches, what is its discriminant score?",
    "message_2": "To find the discriminant score for the new product, we need to plug in the values for W (weight) and L (length) into the discriminant function:\n\nD = 0.2W + 0.5L - 15\n\nThe new product weighs 10 pounds (W = 10) and has a length of 30 inches (L = 30). Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nD = 0.2(10) + 0.5(30) - 15\n\nNow, we can solve for D:\n\nD = 2 + 15 - 15\n\nD = 17 - 15\n\nD = 2\n\nThe discriminant score for the new product is 2."
