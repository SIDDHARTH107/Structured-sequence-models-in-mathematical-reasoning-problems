    "message_2": "To find the complement of set S, we need to define a universal set U that contains all elements under consideration. The complement of set S, denoted by S', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set S.\n\nLet's assume the universal set U contains the integers from 1 to 10, i.e., U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Now we can find the complement of set S with respect to this universal set U.\n\nS' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ S} = {7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nNow, to show that the complement of set S is unique, we need to prove that there cannot be another set that is the complement of S with respect to the same universal set U.\n\nSuppose there exists another set T such that T is also the complement of S with respect to U. This means that T contains all elements in U that are not in S, and S' also contains all elements in U that are not in S. Therefore, T and S' must have the same elements, which means T = S'. Thus, the complement of set S is unique."
