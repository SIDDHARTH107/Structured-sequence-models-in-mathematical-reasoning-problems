    "message_2": "First, let's write the given system of linear equations in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3  2 |\n    | 3  8  1 |\n    | 2  1  1 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 13 |\n    | 14 |\n    |  3 |\n\nNow, we need to check if the matrix A is symmetric and positive definite.\n\n1. Check if A is symmetric:\nA matrix is symmetric if A = A^T (transpose of A). Let's find the transpose of A:\n\nA^T = | 2  3  2 |\n      | 3  8  1 |\n      | 2  1  1 |\n\nSince A = A^T, the matrix A is symmetric.\n\n2. Check if A is positive definite:\nA matrix is positive definite if all its eigenvalues are positive. Let's find the eigenvalues of A:\n\nThe characteristic equation of A is given by the determinant of (A - λI) = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\n| 2-λ  3    2  |\n|  3   8-λ  1  | = 0\n|  2    1   1-λ|\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\n(2-λ)[(8-λ)(1-λ) - 1] - 3[3(1-λ) - 2] + 2[3 - 2(8-λ)] = 0\n\nSolving this equation, we get the eigenvalues λ1 ≈ 0.171, λ2 ≈ 10.829, and λ3 ≈ 0.0002. Since all eigenvalues are positive, the matrix A is positive definite.\n\nNow that we have confirmed that A is symmetric and positive definite, we can proceed with the Cholesky decomposition.\n\nCholesky decomposition states that A = LL^T, where L is a lower triangular matrix and L^T is its transpose.\n\nLet L = | l11  0    0  |\n        | l21 l22  0  |\n        | l31 l32 l33|\n\nThen, L^T = | l11 l21 l31 |\n            |  0  l22 l32 |\n            |  0   0  l33|\n\nNow, we need to find the elements of L by equating the product LL^T to A:\n\nLL^T = | l11^2          l11*l21          l11*l31          |\n       | l11*l21  l21^2 + l22^2    l21*l31 + l22*l32  |\n       | l11*l31  l21*l31 + l22*l32  l31^2 + l32^2 + l33^2|\n\nComparing the elements of LL^T and A, we get:\n\nl11^2 = 2 => l11 = sqrt(2)\nl11*l21 = 3 => l21 = 3/sqrt(2)\nl11*l31 = 2 => l31 = 2/sqrt(2)\nl21^2 + l22^2 = 8 => l22 = sqrt(8 - (3/sqrt(2))^2) = sqrt(1) = 1\nl21*l31 + l22*l32 = 1 => l32 = (1 - 3)/sqrt(2) = -1/sqrt(2)\nl31^2 + l32^2 + l33^2 = 1 => l33 = sqrt(1 - (2/sqrt(2))^2 - (-1/sqrt(2))^2) = 0\n\nSince l33 = 0, the Cholesky decomposition is not possible for this matrix A. Therefore, we cannot solve this system of linear equations using the Cholesky decomposition method."
