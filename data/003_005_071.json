    "message_2": "To find the value of arccos(-0.5) in radians, we need to find the angle whose cosine is -0.5. \n\nRecall that the cosine function is positive in the first and fourth quadrants and negative in the second and third quadrants. Since we are looking for the angle with a negative cosine value, we will focus on the second and third quadrants.\n\nIn a unit circle, the cosine value represents the x-coordinate of a point on the circle. The point where the x-coordinate is -0.5 and lies in the second or third quadrant is when the angle is 120 degrees or 240 degrees.\n\nTo convert these angles to radians, we use the conversion factor:\n\n1 radian = 180 degrees / π\n\nSo, for 120 degrees:\n\n120 * (π / 180) = (2/3)π\n\nAnd for 240 degrees:\n\n240 * (π / 180) = (4/3)π\n\nSince arccos function has a range of [0, π] radians, we will choose the angle in the second quadrant:\n\narccos(-0.5) = (2/3)π radians"
