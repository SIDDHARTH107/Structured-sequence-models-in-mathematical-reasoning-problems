    "message_2": "To find the number of line segments needed to construct the Cantor set of stage 4, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of line segments = 2^n\n\nwhere n is the stage number.\n\nAt stage 0, there is only one line segment (2^0 = 1).\n\nAt stage 1, each line segment is replaced with 2 segments of 1/3 the length, so there are 2^1 = 2 line segments.\n\nAt stage 2, each of the 2 line segments from stage 1 is replaced with 2 segments of 1/3 the length, so there are 2^2 = 4 line segments.\n\nAt stage 3, each of the 4 line segments from stage 2 is replaced with 2 segments of 1/3 the length, so there are 2^3 = 8 line segments.\n\nAt stage 4, each of the 8 line segments from stage 3 is replaced with 2 segments of 1/3 the length, so there are 2^4 = 16 line segments.\n\nTherefore, 16 line segments are needed to construct the Cantor set of stage 4."
