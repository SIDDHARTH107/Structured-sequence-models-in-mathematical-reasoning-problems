    "message_2": "To find the volume of a torus, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * R * r^3\n\nwhere R is the larger radius (the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube) and r is the smaller radius (the radius of the tube itself).\n\nIn this case, R = 6 cm and r = 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 6 * 3^3\n\nVolume = 2 * π^2 * 6 * 27\n\nVolume = 324 * π^2\n\nNow, we can approximate π as 3.14159:\n\nVolume ≈ 324 * (3.14159)^2\n\nVolume ≈ 324 * 9.8696\n\nVolume ≈ 3197.12 cubic centimeters\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 3197.12 cubic centimeters."
