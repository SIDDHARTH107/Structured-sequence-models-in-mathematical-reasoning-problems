    "message_1": "Suppose that the annual rainfall in a certain city is normally distributed with a mean of 800 mm and a standard deviation of 100 mm. Using Monte Carlo simulation, estimate the probability that the annual rainfall in the city will be between 700 mm and 900 mm.",
    "message_2": "To estimate the probability using Monte Carlo simulation, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Generate a large number of random samples from the normal distribution with a mean of 800 mm and a standard deviation of 100 mm.\n2. Count the number of samples that fall between 700 mm and 900 mm.\n3. Divide the count by the total number of samples to get the probability.\n\nHere's a Python code to perform the Monte Carlo simulation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Parameters\nmean = 800\nstd_dev = 100\nnum_samples = 1000000\n\n# Generate random samples\nsamples = np.random.normal(mean, std_dev, num_samples)\n\n# Count samples between 700 mm and 900 mm\ncount = np.sum((samples >= 700) & (samples <= 900))\n\n# Estimate probability\nprobability = count / num_samples\n\nprint(\"Estimated probability:\", probability)\n```\n\nRunning this code, you will get an estimated probability close to the true probability. Note that the result may vary slightly each time you run the simulation due to the random nature of the samples. The more samples you use, the more accurate your estimate will be."
