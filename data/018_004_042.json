    "message_2": "The complement of set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. \n\nTo find A', we can list all the elements in U that are not in A:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNow, we need to prove that the complement of set A is unique. \n\nProof:\n\nLet's assume that there are two different complements of set A, A' and B', such that:\n\nA' = {1, 3, 5} and B' = {x, y, z}\n\nSince A' and B' are both complements of set A, they must satisfy the following properties:\n\n1. A ∩ A' = ∅ (A and A' have no common elements)\n2. A ∪ A' = U (A and A' together form the universal set U)\n3. A ∩ B' = ∅ (A and B' have no common elements)\n4. A ∪ B' = U (A and B' together form the universal set U)\n\nNow, let's compare A' and B':\n\nFrom properties 1 and 3, we know that A and A' have no common elements, and A and B' have no common elements. Since A is the same for both cases, this implies that A' and B' must have the same elements.\n\nFrom properties 2 and 4, we know that A and A' together form the universal set U, and A and B' together form the universal set U. Since A is the same for both cases and U is the same for both cases, this implies that A' and B' must have the same elements.\n\nTherefore, A' = B' = {1, 3, 5}, which means that the complement of set A is unique."
