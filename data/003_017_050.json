    "message_2": "To find the average value of a function over an interval, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/(b-a)) * ∫[f(x) dx] from a to b\n\nIn this case, the function is sin(x), and the interval is from 0 to π. So, a = 0 and b = π.\n\nAverage value of sin(x) = (1/(π-0)) * ∫[sin(x) dx] from 0 to π\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of sin(x) with respect to x:\n\n∫[sin(x) dx] = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral from 0 to π:\n\n[-cos(π) + C] - [-cos(0) + C] = (-cos(π) + cos(0))\n\ncos(π) = -1 and cos(0) = 1, so:\n\n(-(-1) + 1) = 2\n\nNow, we can find the average value:\n\nAverage value of sin(x) = (1/π) * 2 = 2/π\n\nSo, the average value of sin(x) from x = 0 to x = π is 2/π."
