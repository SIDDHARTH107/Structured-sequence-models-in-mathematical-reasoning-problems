    "message_2": "At each iteration, the middle third of each side is replaced with a smaller equilateral triangle, which adds an additional side to the original triangle. So, after each iteration, the number of sides is multiplied by 4.\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the number of sides will be:\n3 * 4^4 = 3 * 256 = 768 sides\n\nAt each iteration, the side length of the new equilateral triangles is one-third of the side length of the previous triangles. After 4 iterations, the side length of the new triangles will be:\n27 cm * (1/3)^4 = 27 cm * 1/81 ≈ 0.333 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch island after 4 iterations is the product of the number of sides and the side length of the new triangles:\n768 * 0.333 ≈ 255.744 cm\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number, the perimeter of the Koch island after 4 iterations is approximately 256 cm."
