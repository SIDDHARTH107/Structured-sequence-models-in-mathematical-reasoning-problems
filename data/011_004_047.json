    "message_2": "To find the number of ways to choose three numbers from a set of five different numbers, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items in the set, k is the number of items we want to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 5 and k = 3, so we have:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!2!)\n\nC(5, 3) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(2 × 1))\n\nC(5, 3) = (120) / (6 × 2)\n\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\n\nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nSo there are 10 ways to choose three numbers from a set of five different numbers."
