    "message_2": "First, let's find the total number of arrangements of the letters in the word \"MATHEMATICS\" without any restrictions. There are 11 letters in the word, with the following repetitions: M (2), A (2), T (2), H (1), E (1), I (1), C (1), and S (1). The total number of arrangements can be calculated using the formula for permutations with repetitions:\n\nTotal arrangements = 11! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 39,916,800 / 8 = 4,989,600\n\nNow, let's consider the restriction that no two vowels can appear together. There are 4 vowels in the word: A (2), E (1), and I (1). We can think of the consonants as creating \"slots\" where the vowels can be placed without being adjacent to another vowel. There are 7 consonants: M (2), T (2), H (1), C (1), and S (1). These consonants create 8 slots (before the first consonant, between consonants, and after the last consonant) for the vowels to be placed in.\n\nWe can now treat the problem as placing the 4 vowels into these 8 slots. This can be done in C(8, 4) ways, where C(n, r) is the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time:\n\nC(8, 4) = 8! / (4! * (8 - 4)!) = 70\n\nNow, we need to multiply this by the number of ways to arrange the consonants and the vowels separately. For the consonants, there are 7 letters with 2 repetitions of M and T:\n\nConsonant arrangements = 7! / (2! * 2!) = 2,520\n\nFor the vowels, there are 4 letters with 2 repetitions of A:\n\nVowel arrangements = 4! / 2! = 12\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to place the vowels, the consonant arrangements, and the vowel arrangements together to get the total number of arrangements with the restriction:\n\nTotal restricted arrangements = 70 * 2,520 * 12 = 2,114,400\n\nSo, there are 2,114,400 ways to arrange the letters of the word \"MATHEMATICS\" such that no two vowels appear together."
