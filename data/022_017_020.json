    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation y'' + 4y = 0, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nNow, we solve for r:\n\nr^2 = -4\nr = ±√(-4)\nr = ±2i\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution for the complex-valued function y(x) will be in the form:\n\ny(x) = C1 * e^(2ix) + C2 * e^(-2ix)\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are arbitrary complex constants."
