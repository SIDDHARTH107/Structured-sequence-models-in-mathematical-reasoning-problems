    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly selected newborn baby weighs between 6 and 8 pounds, we need to calculate the z-scores for both weights and then find the area under the normal distribution curve between those z-scores.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (x - μ) / σ\n\nwhere x is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFor 6 pounds:\nz1 = (6 - 7.5) / 1.2 = -1.25\n\nFor 8 pounds:\nz2 = (8 - 7.5) / 1.2 = 0.4167\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the normal distribution curve between z1 and z2. We can do this by using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a built-in function for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find the following probabilities:\n\nP(Z ≤ z1) = P(Z ≤ -1.25) ≈ 0.211\nP(Z ≤ z2) = P(Z ≤ 0.4167) ≈ 0.661\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected newborn baby weighs between 6 and 8 pounds, we need to find the difference between these probabilities:\n\nP(6 ≤ X ≤ 8) = P(Z ≤ 0.4167) - P(Z ≤ -1.25) = 0.661 - 0.211 = 0.45\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected newborn baby weighs between 6 and 8 pounds is approximately 0.45 or 45%."
