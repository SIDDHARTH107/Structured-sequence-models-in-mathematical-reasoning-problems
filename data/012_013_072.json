    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of a graph G with 5 vertices and 7 edges, we first need to determine the structure of the graph. Since the graph has 5 vertices, the maximum number of edges it can have without being a complete graph is 10 (using the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of vertices). Since G has 7 edges, it is not a complete graph.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for the structure of G:\n\n1. G has a cycle of length 3 (a triangle) and the remaining vertices form a tree.\n2. G has a cycle of length 4 and the remaining vertex is connected to one of the vertices in the cycle.\n3. G is a tree (acyclic).\n\nCase 1: G has a cycle of length 3 and the remaining vertices form a tree.\n\nIn this case, the chromatic polynomial is given by P_G(k) = P_T(k) - P_C3(k), where P_T(k) is the chromatic polynomial of the tree formed by the remaining vertices and P_C3(k) is the chromatic polynomial of the cycle of length 3.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of a tree with n vertices is given by P_T(k) = k(k-1)^(n-1). In this case, we have a tree with 2 vertices, so P_T(k) = k(k-1).\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of a cycle of length 3 is given by P_C3(k) = (k-1)(k-2).\n\nTherefore, the chromatic polynomial of G in this case is P_G(k) = k(k-1) - (k-1)(k-2).\n\nCase 2: G has a cycle of length 4 and the remaining vertex is connected to one of the vertices in the cycle.\n\nIn this case, the chromatic polynomial is given by P_G(k) = P_C4(k) * P_T(k), where P_C4(k) is the chromatic polynomial of the cycle of length 4 and P_T(k) is the chromatic polynomial of the tree formed by the remaining vertex.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of a cycle of length 4 is given by P_C4(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + (k-1)(k-2).\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of a tree with 1 vertex is given by P_T(k) = k.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic polynomial of G in this case is P_G(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + (k-1)(k-2) * k.\n\nCase 3: G is a tree (acyclic).\n\nIn this case, the chromatic polynomial is given by P_G(k) = k(k-1)^4.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the exact structure of G, we cannot find a unique chromatic polynomial for G. However, we have provided the chromatic polynomial for each possible case."
