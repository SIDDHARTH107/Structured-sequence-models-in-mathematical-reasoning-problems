    "message_2": "To find the natural frequency of the system of vibrations, we can use the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere ω is the natural frequency, k is the spring constant, and m is the mass.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nω = sqrt(5 N/m / 2 kg) = sqrt(2.5) = 1.581 rad/s\n\nNow, we need to find the displacement of the mass at time t=2 seconds. We can use the formula for the displacement of a mass-spring system:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement at time t, A is the amplitude, ω is the natural frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nTo find the amplitude A and phase angle φ, we can use the initial conditions:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ) = 0.1 m\nv(0) = -A * ω * sin(φ) = 0.5 m/s\n\nWe already know ω = 1.581 rad/s. Now we need to solve for A and φ.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n0.1 = A * cos(φ)\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n0.5 = -A * 1.581 * sin(φ)\n\nNow, we can use the trigonometric identity sin^2(φ) + cos^2(φ) = 1:\n\n(0.1 / A)^2 + (-0.5 / (1.581 * A))^2 = 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA^2 = 0.1^2 + (0.5 / 1.581)^2\nA^2 = 0.01 + 0.0996\nA = sqrt(0.1096) = 0.331 m\n\nNow, we can find the phase angle φ using the first equation:\n\ncos(φ) = 0.1 / 0.331\nφ = arccos(0.1 / 0.331) = 1.266 rad\n\nNow we can find the displacement at time t=2 seconds:\n\nx(2) = 0.331 * cos(1.581 * 2 + 1.266)\nx(2) = 0.331 * cos(4.428)\nx(2) = 0.331 * (-0.801)\nx(2) = -0.265 m\n\nSo, the displacement of the mass at time t=2 seconds is -0.265 m."
