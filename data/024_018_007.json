    "message_1": "A student is given the following problem based on Differential Geometry- \n\nCalculate the sectional curvature of a surface with Gaussian curvature 3 and mean curvature 2 at a certain point. Let the principal curvatures be denoted by k1 and k2. If k1 is twice as large as k2, then what is the sectional curvature at that point?",
    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature at the given point, we need to use the information provided about the Gaussian curvature (K) and the mean curvature (H). We are also given that k1 is twice as large as k2.\n\nRecall the formulas for Gaussian curvature and mean curvature in terms of principal curvatures k1 and k2:\n\nK = k1 * k2\nH = (k1 + k2) / 2\n\nWe are given K = 3 and H = 2. Since k1 is twice as large as k2, we can write k1 = 2k2. Now, we can substitute this into the equations for K and H:\n\n3 = (2k2) * k2\n2 = (2k2 + k2) / 2\n\nSolving the second equation for k2:\n\n2 = (3k2) / 2\nk2 = 4/3\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of k2 back into the equation for k1:\n\nk1 = 2k2\nk1 = 2 * (4/3)\nk1 = 8/3\n\nNow that we have the values of k1 and k2, we can calculate the sectional curvature. The sectional curvature is given by the product of the principal curvatures:\n\nSectional curvature = k1 * k2\nSectional curvature = (8/3) * (4/3)\nSectional curvature = 32/9\n\nSo, the sectional curvature at the given point is 32/9."
