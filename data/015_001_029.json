    "message_2": "The Lorenz system is a set of three differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = σ(y - x)\ndy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y\ndz/dt = xy - βz\n\nwhere x, y, and z are the variables, and σ, β, and ρ are the parameters. To find the steady-state solutions, we need to find the values of x, y, and z for which the derivatives are equal to zero:\n\nσ(y - x) = 0\nx(ρ - z) - y = 0\nxy - βz = 0\n\nGiven the parameters σ = 10, β = 8/3, and ρ = 28, we can solve the equations:\n\n1) 10(y - x) = 0 => y = x\n2) x(28 - z) - y = 0\n3) xy - (8/3)z = 0\n\nFrom equation 1, we know y = x. We can substitute this into equations 2 and 3:\n\n2) x(28 - z) - x = 0\n3) x^2 - (8/3)z = 0\n\nNow we can find the steady-state solutions:\n\nSolution 1: x = 0\nFrom equation 1, y = 0\nFrom equation 3, 0 - (8/3)z = 0 => z = 0\nSo, (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nSolution 2 and 3:\nFrom equation 2, x(28 - z) - x = x(28 - z - 1) = 0 => z = 27\nFrom equation 3, x^2 - (8/3)(27) = 0 => x^2 = 72 => x = ±sqrt(72)\nSince y = x, y = ±sqrt(72)\nSo, (x, y, z) = (sqrt(72), sqrt(72), 27) and (-sqrt(72), -sqrt(72), 27)\n\nThus, the steady-state solutions for the Lorenz system with the given parameters are:\n\n(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)\n(x, y, z) = (sqrt(72), sqrt(72), 27)\n(x, y, z) = (-sqrt(72), -sqrt(72), 27)"
