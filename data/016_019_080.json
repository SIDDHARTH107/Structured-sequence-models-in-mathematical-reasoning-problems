    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. After each iteration, the number of segments in the curve increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nAfter the 4th iteration, the number of segments in the curve is 4^4 = 256, and the length of each segment is (1/3)^4 = 1/81.\n\nSince the original equilateral triangle has a side length of 1 meter, the perimeter of the Koch island after the 4th iteration is:\n\nPerimeter = (Number of segments) × (Length of each segment) × (Number of sides of the equilateral triangle)\nPerimeter = 256 × (1/81) × 3\nPerimeter = 768/81 ≈ 9.481 meters"
