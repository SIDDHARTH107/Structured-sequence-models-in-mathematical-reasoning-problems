    "message_2": "To find the symmetric difference of A and B, we need to find the elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA ∩ B = {2, 3}\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of A and B with respect to the universal set U. Let's assume U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for this example.\n\nA' = {4, 5, 6}\nB' = {1, 5, 6}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A' and B':\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B')\n\nA' ∪ B' = {1, 4, 5, 6}\nA' ∩ B' = {5, 6}\n\nA' ∆ B' = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B' and A':\n\nB' ∆ A' = (B' ∪ A') - (B' ∩ A')\n\nB' ∪ A' = {1, 4, 5, 6}\nB' ∩ A' = {5, 6}\n\nB' ∆ A' = {1, 4}\n\nWe can see that A ∆ B = A' ∆ B' = B' ∆ A' = {1, 4}. However, this does not prove that symmetric difference is not distributive over complement, as we have only shown the results for this specific example. To prove that symmetric difference is not distributive over complement, we would need to show that it does not hold for all possible sets A and B."
