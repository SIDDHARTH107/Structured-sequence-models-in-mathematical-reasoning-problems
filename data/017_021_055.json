    "message_2": "Using the classification theorem of finite groups, we can determine the possible group structures of a group of order 48. First, let's find the prime factorization of 48: 48 = 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we will consider the Sylow p-subgroups for p = 2 and p = 3.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups: By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 modulo 2. The possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of order 16, which is normal. If n_2 = 3, there are 3 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16, and none of them are normal.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups: By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 16 and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4. If n_3 = 1, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, which is normal. If n_3 = 4, there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups of order 3, and none of them are normal.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible combinations of Sylow subgroups and their corresponding group structures:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: Both Sylow subgroups are normal, and the group is a direct product of the Sylow subgroups. The group structure is Z_16 x Z_3, which is isomorphic to Z_48.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: The Sylow 2-subgroup is normal, and the group is a semidirect product of the Sylow subgroups. The group structure is Z_16 ⋊ Z_3. There are two possibilities here: Z_16 ⋊ Z_3 (trivial action) which is isomorphic to Z_48, and Z_16 ⋊ Z_3 (nontrivial action) which is a non-abelian group.\n\n3. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1: The Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, and the group is a semidirect product of the Sylow subgroups. The group structure is Z_3 ⋊ Z_16. There are two possibilities here: Z_3 ⋊ Z_16 (trivial action) which is isomorphic to Z_48, and Z_3 ⋊ Z_16 (nontrivial action) which is a non-abelian group.\n\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4: Neither Sylow subgroup is normal, and the group structure cannot be determined by the classification theorem alone. However, it is known that there exists a non-abelian group of order 48 with this configuration, called the Quaternion group of order 48, denoted as Q_48.\n\nIn summary, the distinct possible group structures of a group of order 48 are:\n\n1. Z_48 (abelian)\n2. Z_16 ⋊ Z_3 (nontrivial action, non-abelian)\n3. Z_3 ⋊ Z_16 (nontrivial action, non-abelian)\n4. Q_48 (non-abelian)"
