    "message_1": "A company wants to test the reliability of its new electronic device. The failure rate of the device is assumed to follow a Beta distribution with parameters α = 2 and β = 5. After observing 100 devices, 10 of them failed. What is the posterior distribution of the failure rate?",
    "message_2": "To find the posterior distribution of the failure rate, we will use the concept of Bayesian updating. In this case, we have a prior distribution (the Beta distribution with parameters α = 2 and β = 5) and we want to update it with the new data (10 failures out of 100 devices).\n\nThe likelihood function for this problem is the binomial distribution, since we have a fixed number of trials (100 devices) and a binary outcome (failure or success). The likelihood function is given by:\n\nL(p) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere p is the failure rate, n is the total number of devices, k is the number of failures, and C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient (the number of ways to choose k failures from n devices).\n\nIn our case, n = 100, k = 10, so the likelihood function is:\n\nL(p) = C(100, 10) * p^10 * (1-p)^(100-10)\n\nNow, we need to multiply the prior distribution (the Beta distribution) by the likelihood function to obtain the unnormalized posterior distribution:\n\nUnnormalized_posterior(p) = Beta(p; α=2, β=5) * L(p)\n\nSince the Beta distribution is the conjugate prior for the binomial likelihood, the posterior distribution will also be a Beta distribution. To find the parameters of the posterior distribution, we simply add the number of failures to the α parameter and the number of successes to the β parameter:\n\nPosterior(p) = Beta(p; α_new, β_new)\n\nwhere α_new = α + k = 2 + 10 = 12 and β_new = β + (n - k) = 5 + (100 - 10) = 95.\n\nSo, the posterior distribution of the failure rate is a Beta distribution with parameters α = 12 and β = 95."
