    "message_2": "To find the dominant eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using the power iteration method, we will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Start with an initial vector x0 = [1; 1; 1].\n2. Calculate the product Ax0.\n3. Normalize the resulting vector.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the relative error in the eigenvalue estimate is less than 0.01.\n\nLet's perform the power iteration method:\n\nMatrix A = [−1  1  0; 1 −1  0; 0  0 2]\n\nInitial vector x0 = [1; 1; 1]\n\nIteration 1:\nAx0 = [-1*1 + 1*1 + 0*1; 1*1 - 1*1 + 0*1; 0*1 + 0*1 + 2*1] = [0; 0; 2]\nNormalize: x1 = [0; 0; 1]\n\nIteration 2:\nAx1 = [-1*0 + 1*0 + 0*1; 1*0 - 1*0 + 0*1; 0*0 + 0*0 + 2*1] = [0; 0; 2]\nNormalize: x2 = [0; 0; 1]\n\nSince x1 and x2 are the same, we have reached convergence. Now, we can estimate the dominant eigenvalue using the Rayleigh quotient:\n\nEigenvalue = (x2^T * A * x2) / (x2^T * x2)\nEigenvalue = ([0, 0, 1] * A * [0; 0; 1]) / ([0, 0, 1] * [0; 0; 1])\nEigenvalue = ([0, 0, 2]) / 1\nEigenvalue = 2\n\nSo, the dominant eigenvalue is 2, and its corresponding eigenvector is [0; 0; 1]."
