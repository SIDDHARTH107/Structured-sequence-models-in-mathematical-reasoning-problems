    "message_1": "A plane is flying 5000 feet above the ground. If the angle of elevation from the ground to the plane is 30 degrees, what is the distance from the plane to the observer on the ground? (Round to the nearest foot)",
    "message_2": "We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, the side opposite the angle is the altitude of the plane (5000 feet), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the observer to the point on the ground directly below the plane. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(30°) = (5000 feet) / distance\n\nTo find the distance, we can rearrange the equation:\n\ndistance = (5000 feet) / tan(30°)\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of the tangent of 30 degrees, which is approximately 0.577:\n\ndistance = (5000 feet) / 0.577\n\ndistance ≈ 8660 feet\n\nSo, the distance from the plane to the observer on the ground is approximately 8660 feet."
