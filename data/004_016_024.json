    "message_2": "The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists a point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this problem, we have a continuous function (distance traveled) over a closed interval [0, 3] hours and differentiable on the open interval (0, 3) hours. We want to find the average speed of the car on this trip.\n\nThe average speed is given by the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. In this case, the car travels 210 miles in 3 hours.\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) / (Total time)\nAverage speed = 210 miles / 3 hours\nAverage speed = 70 miles per hour\n\nSo, the average speed of the car on this trip is 70 miles per hour. According to the Mean Value Theorem, there must be a point in time during the trip where the instantaneous speed of the car is exactly 70 miles per hour."
