    "message_2": "To solve the inequality -2x + 5 ≥ -3x + 7, we first need to isolate the variable x.\n\nStep 1: Add 3x to both sides of the inequality to get rid of the -3x term.\n-2x + 3x + 5 ≥ -3x + 3x + 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx + 5 ≥ 7\n\nStep 2: Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality to isolate x.\nx + 5 - 5 ≥ 7 - 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx ≥ 2\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x ≥ 2.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line, follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a number line with the numbers -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n2. Since x is greater than or equal to 2, place a closed circle on the number 2, indicating that 2 is included in the solution.\n3. Shade the number line to the right of the closed circle, indicating that all numbers greater than 2 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph of the solution on a number line will have a closed circle at 2 and be shaded to the right, representing all numbers greater than or equal to 2."
