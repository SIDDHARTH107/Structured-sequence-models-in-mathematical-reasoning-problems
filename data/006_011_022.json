    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula and then find the complement of the probability that fewer than 3 workers face an accident.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X=k) is the probability of exactly k successes (accidents) in n trials (workers), C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, p is the probability of success (accident), and (1-p) is the probability of failure (no accident).\n\nIn this case, n = 500 workers, p = 0.005 probability of an accident.\n\nFirst, we'll find the probability of 0, 1, or 2 workers having an accident:\n\nP(X=0) = C(500, 0) * (0.005)^0 * (0.995)^500\nP(X=1) = C(500, 1) * (0.005)^1 * (0.995)^499\nP(X=2) = C(500, 2) * (0.005)^2 * (0.995)^498\n\nNow, we'll find the sum of these probabilities:\n\nP(X<3) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2)\n\nFinally, we'll find the complement of this probability, which is the probability of at least 3 workers having an accident:\n\nP(X≥3) = 1 - P(X<3)\n\nCalculating the values:\n\nP(X=0) ≈ 0.0305\nP(X=1) ≈ 0.1524\nP(X=2) ≈ 0.3812\n\nP(X<3) ≈ 0.0305 + 0.1524 + 0.3812 ≈ 0.5641\n\nP(X≥3) ≈ 1 - 0.5641 ≈ 0.4359\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 workers will face an accident in a month is approximately 43.59%."
