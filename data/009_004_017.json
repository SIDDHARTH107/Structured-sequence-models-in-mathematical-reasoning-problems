The system is governed by the differential equation y'' + 4y = 0, where y is the displacement from equilibrium. Find the amplitude, period and frequency of the resulting motion. Round your answers to two decimal places.\n\nNote: The solution to this problem involves solving the differential equation using known techniques and then determining the corresponding values for amplitude, period and frequency based on the resulting solution.",
    "message_2": "First, let's solve the given differential equation y'' + 4y = 0. This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = ±2i\n\nSince we have complex roots, the general solution for the displacement y(t) is given by:\n\ny(t) = C1 * cos(2t) + C2 * sin(2t)\n\nNow, we need to find the constants C1 and C2 using the initial conditions. At t = 0, we have:\n\ny(0) = 0.1 = C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0)\n0.1 = C1\n\nNow, let's find the first derivative of y(t) to get the velocity:\n\ny'(t) = -2 * C1 * sin(2t) + 2 * C2 * cos(2t)\n\nUsing the initial velocity condition, at t = 0:\n\ny'(0) = -0.5 = -2 * C1 * sin(0) + 2 * C2 * cos(0)\n-0.5 = 2 * C2\n\nSolving for C2, we get:\n\nC2 = -0.25\n\nNow, we have the particular solution:\n\ny(t) = 0.1 * cos(2t) - 0.25 * sin(2t)\n\nTo find the amplitude A, we use the formula:\n\nA = sqrt(C1^2 + C2^2)\nA = sqrt((0.1)^2 + (-0.25)^2)\nA ≈ 0.27 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThe period T is related to the angular frequency ω by the formula:\n\nT = 2π / ω\n\nIn our case, ω = 2, so:\n\nT = 2π / 2\nT = π ≈ 3.14 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThe frequency f is the reciprocal of the period:\n\nf = 1 / T\nf ≈ 1 / 3.14\nf ≈ 0.32 Hz (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the amplitude is approximately 0.27 m, the period is approximately 3.14 s, and the frequency is approximately 0.32 Hz."
