    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 12. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible structure of G and show that it must be isomorphic to one of the groups C12, A4, or D6.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups (subgroups of order 4) in G must divide 12/4 = 3, and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, there can be either 1 or 3 such subgroups. Similarly, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups (subgroups of order 3) in G must divide 12/3 = 4, and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, there can be either 1 or 4 such subgroups.\n\nCase 1: G has a unique 2-Sylow subgroup and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup.\nLet P be the unique 2-Sylow subgroup of G, and let Q be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since both P and Q are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P and Q are relatively prime, their intersection is trivial. Thus, by the internal direct product theorem, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which is a cyclic group of order 12. In this case, G is isomorphic to C12.\n\nCase 2: G has three 2-Sylow subgroups and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup.\nLet Q be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since Q is unique, it is normal in G. Let P be any 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Since the order of P is 4, P is either isomorphic to C4 or to V4 (the Klein four-group). If P is isomorphic to C4, then G has an element of order 4. However, A4, the alternating group on 4 elements, has no elements of order 4, and D6, the dihedral group of order 12, has no normal subgroups of order 3. Thus, in this case, G cannot be isomorphic to either A4 or D6.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to V4, then G has an element of order 2 that is not in Q. Let x be such an element. Since Q is normal in G, the product xQ is a left coset of Q in G, and thus has order 3. Therefore, G has an element of order 3, and so G has a subgroup isomorphic to the symmetric group S3. Since |S3| = 6, this subgroup has index 2 in G, and thus is normal in G. Moreover, since the order of G is twice the order of this subgroup, G must be isomorphic to a semi-direct product of this subgroup and a group of order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to D6.\n\nCase 3: G has three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups.\nIn this case, G has no normal subgroups of order 3 or 4. However, both A4 and D6 have normal subgroups of order 3, so G cannot be isomorphic to either of these groups. Moreover, since G has no normal subgroups of order 4, it cannot be isomorphic to a direct product of a group of order 4 and a group of order 3, and thus cannot be isomorphic to C12.\n\nHowever, A4 has three 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups, and has the same order as G. Thus, in this case, G is isomorphic to A4.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 12, it must be isomorphic to one of the groups C12, A4, or D6."
