    "message_1": "A company wants to transport 150 units of products to different locations using two trucks. The first truck can carry 50 units, while the second truck can carry 70 units. The cost of transporting the products using the first truck is $100, while the cost of using the second truck is $125. What is the minimum cost that the company can incur in transporting all the products?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of first trucks used and y be the number of second trucks used. We have the following constraints:\n\n50x + 70y ≥ 150 (the trucks must carry at least 150 units)\nx ≥ 0 (cannot use a negative number of trucks)\ny ≥ 0 (cannot use a negative number of trucks)\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the total cost:\n\nCost = 100x + 125y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies the constraints. We can rewrite the first constraint as:\n\ny ≥ (150 - 50x) / 70\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative integers, we can check the possible values of x and y that satisfy the constraints:\n\n1. If x = 0, then y ≥ (150 - 50*0) / 70 = 2.14, so y = 3 (smallest integer greater than 2.14). In this case, the cost is 100*0 + 125*3 = $375.\n\n2. If x = 1, then y ≥ (150 - 50*1) / 70 = 1.43, so y = 2 (smallest integer greater than 1.43). In this case, the cost is 100*1 + 125*2 = $350.\n\n3. If x = 2, then y ≥ (150 - 50*2) / 70 = 0.71, so y = 1 (smallest integer greater than 0.71). In this case, the cost is 100*2 + 125*1 = $325.\n\n4. If x = 3, then y ≥ (150 - 50*3) / 70 = 0, so y = 0. In this case, the cost is 100*3 + 125*0 = $300.\n\nWe can see that the minimum cost is $300 when using 3 first trucks and no second trucks."
