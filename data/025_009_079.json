    "message_2": "To compute the self-intersection number $D^2$, we will use the fact that the intersection number of two divisors is equal to the intersection number of their corresponding line bundles. Let $L_D$ be the line bundle corresponding to the divisor $D$. Then, we want to compute the intersection number $L_D^2$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the universal family of smooth plane cubic curves with a marked point $p$. This family is parameterized by the moduli space $M$. Let $\\pi: \\mathcal{C} \\to M$ be the universal family, and let $\\mathcal{P} \\subset \\mathcal{C}$ be the universal marked point. Then, we have a line bundle $\\mathcal{L}$ on $\\mathcal{C}$, whose fiber over a point $(C, p) \\in M$ is the line $L$ passing through $p$ and the flex point of $C$. \n\nNow, we can pull back the line bundle $\\mathcal{L}$ via the projection $\\pi$ to obtain a line bundle $\\pi^*\\mathcal{L}$ on $M$. By definition, the divisor class of $\\pi^*\\mathcal{L}$ is equal to $D$. Therefore, we want to compute the intersection number $(\\pi^*\\mathcal{L})^2$.\n\nTo do this, we will use the projection formula, which states that for any line bundle $L$ on $M$ and any line bundle $L'$ on $\\mathcal{C}$, we have\n$$\n(\\pi^*L \\cdot L') = (\\pi_*(L' \\cdot \\pi^*L) \\cdot L).\n$$\nApplying this formula to our situation, we get\n$$\n(\\pi^*\\mathcal{L} \\cdot \\mathcal{L}) = (\\pi_*(\\mathcal{L}^2) \\cdot \\mathcal{L}).\n$$\nNow, we can compute the intersection number $(\\pi^*\\mathcal{L})^2$ as follows:\n$$\n(\\pi^*\\mathcal{L})^2 = (\\pi^*\\mathcal{L} \\cdot \\pi^*\\mathcal{L}) = (\\pi_*(\\mathcal{L}^2) \\cdot \\mathcal{L}).\n$$\nSince $\\mathcal{L}$ is a line bundle on $\\mathcal{C}$, the intersection number $(\\pi_*(\\mathcal{L}^2) \\cdot \\mathcal{L})$ is equal to the degree of the line bundle $\\mathcal{L}^2$ on $\\mathcal{C}$. \n\nRecall that a smooth plane cubic curve has exactly 9 flex points, and the line $L$ passes through one of these flex points. Therefore, the degree of the line bundle $\\mathcal{L}$ on $\\mathcal{C}$ is 9. Then, the degree of the line bundle $\\mathcal{L}^2$ on $\\mathcal{C}$ is $9^2 = 81$. \n\nFinally, we have\n$$\nD^2 = (\\pi^*\\mathcal{L})^2 = (\\pi_*(\\mathcal{L}^2) \\cdot \\mathcal{L}) = 81.\n$$\nSo the self-intersection number $D^2$ is equal to 81."
