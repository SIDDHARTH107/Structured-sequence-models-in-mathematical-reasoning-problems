    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it to form a continuous curve. The length of the curve increases with each iteration.\n\nLet's denote the length of the curve after n iterations as L(n). After the first iteration, the length of the curve is 2 units (L(1) = 2). With each iteration, the length of the curve doubles. Therefore, the length of the curve after n iterations can be expressed as:\n\nL(n) = 2^n\n\nTo find the total length of the Dragon curve after 10 iterations, we can plug in n = 10:\n\nL(10) = 2^10 = 1024 units\n\nSo, the total length of the Dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1024 units."
