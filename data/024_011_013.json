    "message_2": "To find the Laplacian of the function $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)$ on the flat torus, we first need to compute the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$. \n\nThe first partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\cos(x)\\sin(y) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\sin(x)\\cos(y)\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the second partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = -\\sin(x)\\sin(y) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = -\\sin(x)\\sin(y)\n$$\n\nNow, we can find the Laplacian of $f$ by summing the second partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\Delta f = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = -\\sin(x)\\sin(y) - \\sin(x)\\sin(y) = -2\\sin(x)\\sin(y)\n$$\n\nSo, the Laplacian of $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)$ on the flat torus is $\\Delta f = -2\\sin(x)\\sin(y)$."
