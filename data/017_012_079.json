    "message_2": "To prove that G is isomorphic to one of the following groups: C16, D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16, we will use the Sylow Theorems and the properties of p-groups.\n\nSince G has order 16, it is a p-group with p = 2. Let n be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G. By the Sylow Theorems, we know that n must divide the order of G, and n â‰¡ 1 (mod 2). The only possibilities for n are 1 and 16. If n = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup of G, which must be normal. In this case, G is a 2-group with a normal Sylow 2-subgroup, so G is isomorphic to C16.\n\nIf n = 16, then G has 16 Sylow 2-subgroups, and each of these subgroups has order 8. Let H be one of these Sylow 2-subgroups. Since H has order 8, it is also a p-group with p = 2. By the same argument as before, H must be isomorphic to either C8 or D4. If H is isomorphic to C8, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of H and a group of order 2, which is the non-abelian group of order 16.\n\nIf H is isomorphic to D4, then G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of H and a group of order 2. In this case, G is isomorphic to D8.\n\nTherefore, G must be isomorphic to one of the following groups: C16, D8, or the non-abelian group of order 16."
