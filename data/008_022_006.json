    "message_2": "First, let's rewrite the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n```\n|  2   4   6 | | x |   |  8  |\n|  4  8.1  13 | | y | = | 17  |\n| -2  -4 -5.9 | | z |   | -9  |\n```\n\nNow, let's perform Gaussian elimination to get an upper triangular matrix:\n\n1. Divide the first row by 2 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n|  1   2   3 | | x |   |  4  |\n|  4  8.1  13 | | y | = | 17  |\n| -2  -4 -5.9 | | z |   | -9  |\n```\n\n2. Replace the second row with (-4 * first row + second row) and the third row with (2 * first row + third row):\n\n```\n|  1   2    3  | | x |   |  4   |\n|  0  0.1   1  | | y | = |  1   |\n|  0   0  -0.1 | | z |   | -1   |\n```\n\n3. Divide the second row by 0.1 to get a leading 1:\n\n```\n|  1   2    3  | | x |   |  4   |\n|  0   1   10  | | y | = | 10   |\n|  0   0  -0.1 | | z |   | -1   |\n```\n\n4. Replace the first row with (-2 * second row + first row):\n\n```\n|  1   0  -17 | | x |   | -16  |\n|  0   1   10 | | y | = |  10  |\n|  0   0  -0.1 | | z |   |  -1  |\n```\n\nNow, we can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. Divide the third row by -0.1 to get z:\n\n```\nz = -1 / -0.1 = 10\n```\n\n2. Substitute z into the second row to get y:\n\n```\ny = (10 - 10 * 10) = -90\n```\n\n3. Substitute y and z into the first row to get x:\n\n```\nx = (-16 - (-17 * 10)) = 154\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = 154\ny = -90\nz = 10\n```"
