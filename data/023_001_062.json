    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of a square wave with a period of 2 seconds and an amplitude of 3 units, we can use the following formula for the Fourier series of a square wave:\n\nf(t) = (4 * A / π) * Σ [(1 / (2n - 1)) * sin((2n - 1) * π * t / T)]\n\nwhere f(t) is the Fourier series, A is the amplitude, T is the period, and the summation is taken over all odd integers n.\n\nIn this case, A = 3 units and T = 2 seconds. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nf(t) = (4 * 3 / π) * Σ [(1 / (2n - 1)) * sin((2n - 1) * π * t / 2)]\n\nf(t) = (12 / π) * Σ [(1 / (2n - 1)) * sin((2n - 1) * π * t / 2)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the given square wave with a period of 2 seconds and an amplitude of 3 units."
