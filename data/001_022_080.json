    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x - 4\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots algebraically can be challenging. However, we can approximate the x-intercepts by graphing the equation and observing where the curve intersects the x-axis.\n\nUpon graphing the equation, we find that the curve intersects the x-axis at approximately:\n\nx ≈ 0.64, x ≈ 1.57, and x ≈ 3.79\n\nThese are the x-intercepts.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we need to set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = (0)^3 - 2(0)^2 + 3(0) - 4\n\ny = -4\n\nSo the y-intercept is at the point (0, -4).\n\nTo find the turning points, we need to find the critical points of the function by taking the first derivative and setting it equal to 0:\n\ny' = 3x^2 - 4x + 3\n\n0 = 3x^2 - 4x + 3\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (4 ± √((-4)^2 - 4(3)(3))) / (2(3))\n\nx = (4 ± √(16 - 36)) / 6\n\nx = (4 ± √(-20)) / 6\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for x. This means that there are no turning points for this function.\n\nIn summary, the x-intercepts are approximately x ≈ 0.64, x ≈ 1.57, and x ≈ 3.79, the y-intercept is at the point (0, -4), and there are no turning points."
