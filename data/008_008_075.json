    "message_1": "A company produces two products, product A and product B. Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of machine time, 2 hours of assembly time, and yields a profit of $400. Each unit of product B requires 2 hours of machine time, 4 hours of assembly time, and yields a profit of $600. The machine is available for a maximum of 60 hours per week and the assembly department is available for a maximum of 48 hours per week. Determine the number of units of each product that should be produced in order to maximize the profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 400x + 600y\n\nConstraints are given by the available machine and assembly times:\n3x + 2y ≤ 60 (machine time)\n2x + 4y ≤ 48 (assembly time)\n\nWe also have non-negativity constraints:\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequalities for y:\ny ≤ (60 - 3x) / 2 (from the machine time constraint)\ny ≤ (48 - 2x) / 4 (from the assembly time constraint)\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints and identifying the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n(0, 0) - Origin\n(0, 12) - Intersection of y-axis and assembly time constraint\n(20, 0) - Intersection of x-axis and machine time constraint\n(8, 8) - Intersection of machine time and assembly time constraints\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function P at each of these vertices:\nP(0, 0) = 400(0) + 600(0) = $0\nP(0, 12) = 400(0) + 600(12) = $7,200\nP(20, 0) = 400(20) + 600(0) = $8,000\nP(8, 8) = 400(8) + 600(8) = $8,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $8,000, which can be achieved by producing either 20 units of product A and 0 units of product B or 8 units of product A and 8 units of product B."
