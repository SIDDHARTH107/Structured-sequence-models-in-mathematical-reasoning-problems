    "message_1": "Suppose there is an auction for an artwork where there are two bidders, A and B. Bidder A values the artwork at $8000 while Bidder B values it at $7000. The auction is a sealed-bid first-price auction, meaning each bidder submits a sealed bid, and the highest bidder wins the artwork and pays the bid amount. If Bidder A submits a bid of $6000 and Bidder B submits a bid of $6500, who wins the artwork and how much do they pay for it?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid first-price auction, the highest bidder wins the artwork and pays the bid amount. In this case, Bidder A submitted a bid of $6000, and Bidder B submitted a bid of $6500. Since $6500 is higher than $6000, Bidder B wins the artwork and pays $6500 for it."
