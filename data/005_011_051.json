    "message_1": "A researcher wants to compare the effectiveness of two different tutoring methods on students' test scores. They randomly select 20 students and assign 10 of them to group A, which uses method 1, and another 10 to group B, which uses method 2. After 4 tutoring sessions, the researcher compares the average test scores of the two groups. The test scores for group A are: 75, 78, 82, 86, 90, 91, 92, 95, 98, and 100. The test scores for group B are: 80, 81, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 92, 95, and 96. \n\nWhat is the mean test score for group A? What is the mean test score for group B? Which tutoring method appears to be more effective based on these results?",
    "message_2": "To find the mean test score for each group, we need to add up all the test scores in each group and then divide by the number of students in each group (which is 10 for both groups).\n\nFor group A:\nMean = (75 + 78 + 82 + 86 + 90 + 91 + 92 + 95 + 98 + 100) / 10\nMean = 887 / 10\nMean = 88.7\n\nFor group B:\nMean = (80 + 81 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 87 + 89 + 92 + 95 + 96) / 10\nMean = 872 / 10\nMean = 87.2\n\nBased on these results, the mean test score for group A is 88.7, and the mean test score for group B is 87.2. Since group A has a higher mean test score, it appears that tutoring method 1 (used in group A) is more effective than tutoring method 2 (used in group B)."
