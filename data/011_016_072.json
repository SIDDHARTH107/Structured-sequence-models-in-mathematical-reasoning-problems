    "message_2": "In a round-robin tournament, each player plays against every other player exactly once. For 8 players, we can use the formula for the number of matches in a round-robin tournament, which is:\n\nNumber of matches = n * (n - 1) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of players.\n\nIn this case, n = 8, so the total number of matches is:\n\nNumber of matches = 8 * (8 - 1) / 2 = 8 * 7 / 2 = 28 matches\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of rounds required to complete these 28 matches. In each round, half of the players (4 players) will be playing simultaneously. Therefore, the number of matches per round is 4.\n\nTo find the number of rounds, we divide the total number of matches by the number of matches per round:\n\nNumber of rounds = 28 matches / 4 matches per round = 7 rounds\n\nSo, you will need to schedule 7 rounds for the 8 players to play against each other exactly once in the round-robin tennis tournament."
