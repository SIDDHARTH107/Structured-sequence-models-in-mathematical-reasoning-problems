    "message_2": "Let's first recall Poincare duality. For a closed orientable manifold $M$ of dimension $d$, Poincare duality states that there is an isomorphism between the homology group $H_k(M)$ and the cohomology group $H^{d-k}(M)$ for all $k$. In our case, $M$ is a surface, so $d=2$. \n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of $\\gamma$ with $S$. Since $\\gamma$ is a closed curve, it is a 1-dimensional submanifold of $M$. The intersection of $\\gamma$ with $S$ is a 0-dimensional submanifold of $M$, which we can think of as a collection of points. Let's denote this intersection as $I(\\gamma, S)$. We want to determine the homology class represented by this intersection.\n\nTo do this, we can use Poincare duality. Since $I(\\gamma, S)$ is a 0-dimensional submanifold, it represents a class in $H_0(M)$. By Poincare duality, there is an isomorphism between $H_0(M)$ and $H^2(M)$. \n\nFor a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, the cohomology ring $H^*(M)$ is given by:\n\n$H^0(M) = \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the unit,\n$H^1(M) = \\mathbb{Z}^{2g}$, generated by the $2g$ independent cycles, and\n$H^2(M) = \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the fundamental class.\n\nSince the intersection $I(\\gamma, S)$ represents a class in $H_0(M)$, its Poincare dual is a class in $H^2(M)$. The only non-trivial class in $H^2(M)$ is the fundamental class, which is represented by the submanifold $S$. Therefore, the homology class represented by the intersection of $\\gamma$ with $S$ is the fundamental class of $M$."
