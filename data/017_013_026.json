    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 18. We know that 18 = 2 * 3^2, so by the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, must divide 2 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can only be 1. Let P be the unique 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Since P is normal in G, we can consider the quotient group G/P.\n\nNow, G/P has order 2, so it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C2. By the correspondence theorem, there exists a 2-Sylow subgroup Q of G such that Q/P is the unique 2-Sylow subgroup of G/P. Since the index of Q in G is 3, which is the smallest prime dividing the order of G, Q is normal in G by the normalizer-centralizer theorem.\n\nSince P and Q are both normal in G and their intersection is trivial (as their orders are distinct prime powers), we have that G is isomorphic to the direct product P ⨯ Q by the internal direct product theorem. The order of P is 9 and the order of Q is 2. Thus, P is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 ⨯ C3, and Q is isomorphic to C2.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to C9, then G is isomorphic to C9 ⨯ C2, which is the cyclic group C18.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to C3 ⨯ C3, then G is isomorphic to (C3 ⨯ C3) ⨯ C2. Now, we use the fact that the direct product is associative and commutative up to isomorphism, so G is isomorphic to C3 ⨯ (C3 ⨯ C2). Since C3 ⨯ C2 is a group of order 6, we have the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is the non-abelian group of order 18, which is the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 2, where the non-trivial element of the latter group acts as an automorphism of order 2 on the former group.\n\nThus, there are no other groups of order 18 besides the cyclic group C18, the non-abelian group of order 18, or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6."
