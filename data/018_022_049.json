    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A△B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B, but not in their intersection.\n\nA△B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {p, q, r, s}\nA ∩ B = {q, r}\n\nA△B = {p, s}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A, denoted as B△A. Since the symmetric difference is commutative, B△A = A△B.\n\nB△A = {p, s}\n\nNow, let's evaluate the Cartesian product of (A△B) x (B△A):\n\n(A△B) x (B△A) = ({p, s}) x ({p, s}) = {(p, p), (p, s), (s, p), (s, s)}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of A x B and B x A:\n\nA x B = {(p, q), (p, r), (p, s), (q, q), (q, r), (q, s), (r, q), (r, r), (r, s)}\nB x A = {(q, p), (q, q), (q, r), (r, p), (r, q), (r, r), (s, p), (s, q), (s, r)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (AxB) and (BxA):\n\n(AxB) △ (BxA) = ({(p, q), (p, r), (p, s), (q, q), (q, r), (q, s), (r, q), (r, r), (r, s)}) △ ({(q, p), (q, q), (q, r), (r, p), (r, q), (r, r), (s, p), (s, q), (s, r)})\n\n(AxB) △ (BxA) = {(p, q), (p, r), (p, s), (q, p), (q, r), (q, s), (r, p), (r, q), (r, s), (s, p), (s, q), (s, r)}\n\nWe can see that (A△B) x (B△A) = {(p, p), (p, s), (s, p), (s, s)} is not equal to (AxB) △ (BxA) = {(p, q), (p, r), (p, s), (q, p), (q, r), (q, s), (r, p), (r, q), (r, s), (s, p), (s, q), (s, r)}."
