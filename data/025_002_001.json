    "message_2": "To compute the degree of the intersection of X with the hyperplane H, we first need to find the intersection points. Since H is defined by $w=0$, we can substitute $w=0$ into the equations defining X:\n\n$$\nx^2y + xyz + y^3 + x^2z = 0, \\\\ \nx^3 - 2x^2y + xy^2 + x^2z + y^2z - xz^2 = 0.\n$$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations in three variables ($x, y, z$). We can try to eliminate one of the variables to find the intersection points. Let's eliminate $z$ by solving the first equation for $z$:\n\n$$\nz = -\\frac{x^2y + y^3}{x^2 + xy} = -\\frac{y(x^2 + y^2)}{x(x + y)}.\n$$\n\nNow substitute this expression for $z$ into the second equation:\n\n$$\nx^3 - 2x^2y + xy^2 + x^2\\left(-\\frac{y(x^2 + y^2)}{x(x + y)}\\right) + y^2\\left(-\\frac{y(x^2 + y^2)}{x(x + y)}\\right) - x\\left(-\\frac{y(x^2 + y^2)}{x(x + y)}\\right)^2 = 0.\n$$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$$\nx^3 - 2x^2y + xy^2 - y^3 - y^4 - x^2y^2 + x^3y^2 = 0.\n$$\n\nNow we have a single equation in three variables. To find the intersection points, we can look for the homogeneous components of the highest degree. The highest degree terms are $-y^4$, $x^3y^2$, and $-x^2y^2$. The degree of the intersection is the sum of the exponents of these terms, which is $4+3+2=9$.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the intersection of X with the hyperplane H is 9."
