    "message_1": "A cryptographic hash function takes a message of any length as input and produces a fixed-length hash value that serves as a unique digital fingerprint of the message. Let's assume we have a hash function that produces a 32-bit hash value. \n\nNow, suppose you want to hash a message that is 128 bits long using this hash function. How many possible unique hash values can this function produce?",
    "message_2": "Since the hash function produces a 32-bit hash value, there are 2^32 possible unique hash values that can be produced. This is because each bit can have 2 possible values (0 or 1), and there are 32 bits in total. So, the number of possible unique hash values is:\n\n2^32 = 4,294,967,296"
