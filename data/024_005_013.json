    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to find the normal vector at the given point (3, 4, 0) on the surface of the sphere. Since the sphere is centered at the origin, the normal vector is simply the position vector of the point (3, 4, 0). So, the normal vector N is:\n\nN = (3, 4, 0)\n\nNow, we need to find the shape operator (also known as the Weingarten map) for the sphere. The shape operator S is given by:\n\nS = -dN/dP\n\nwhere dN is the differential of the normal vector and dP is the differential of the position vector. For a sphere of radius r centered at the origin, the shape operator can be simplified as:\n\nS = -1/r * I\n\nwhere I is the identity matrix. In our case, r = 5, so:\n\nS = -1/5 * I\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues of the shape operator, which are the principal curvatures k1 and k2. Since the shape operator is a diagonal matrix with all diagonal elements equal to -1/5, the eigenvalues are simply the diagonal elements themselves. Therefore, the principal curvatures are:\n\nk1 = k2 = -1/5\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (3, 4, 0) on the surface of the sphere are both -1/5."
