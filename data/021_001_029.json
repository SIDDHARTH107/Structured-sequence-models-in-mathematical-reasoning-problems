    "message_2": "First, we will write the given system of linear equations in the form of an augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 3   2  -1 |  4 ]\n[ 2  -4   6 | -2 ]\n[-1  1/2 -2 |  1 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nTo do this, we will perform the following row operations:\n\nR2 = R2 - (2/3)R1\nR3 = R3 + R1\n\n```\n[  3    2   -1 |   4  ]\n[  0   -8    8 |  -6  ]\n[  0    5/2 -5/2|   5  ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nTo do this, we will perform the following row operation:\n\nR3 = R3 - (5/8)R2\n\n```\n[  3    2    -1 |   4  ]\n[  0   -8     8 |  -6  ]\n[  0    0     0 |   1  ]\n```\n\nAt this point, we can see that the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the given system of linear equations has no solution."
