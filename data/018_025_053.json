    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A △ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA △ B = {1, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of A and B, denoted as A ∩ B. The intersection is the set of elements that are in both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection by evaluating (A △ B) ∩ B and (B △ A) ∩ B. Note that the symmetric difference is commutative, so A △ B = B △ A.\n\n(A △ B) ∩ B = {1, 5} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {5}\n\n(B △ A) ∩ B = {1, 5} ∩ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {5}\n\nSince (A △ B) ∩ B = (B △ A) ∩ B, the symmetric difference of A and B is commutative with respect to intersection."
