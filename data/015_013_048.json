    "message_2": "To find the population after 10 time steps, we will iterate the logistic equation 10 times, starting with the initial population P0 = 25.\n\nP0 = 25\n\nLet's calculate the population for each time step:\n\nP1 = 3.5 * P0 * (1 - P0/100) = 3.5 * 25 * (1 - 25/100)\nP2 = 3.5 * P1 * (1 - P1/100)\n...\nP10 = 3.5 * P9 * (1 - P9/100)\n\nNow, let's compute the values:\n\nP1 = 3.5 * 25 * (1 - 25/100) = 65.625\nP2 = 3.5 * 65.625 * (1 - 65.625/100) ≈ 79.845\nP3 = 3.5 * 79.845 * (1 - 79.845/100) ≈ 55.982\nP4 = 3.5 * 55.982 * (1 - 55.982/100) ≈ 85.661\nP5 = 3.5 * 85.661 * (1 - 85.661/100) ≈ 37.019\nP6 = 3.5 * 37.019 * (1 - 37.019/100) ≈ 82.186\nP7 = 3.5 * 82.186 * (1 - 82.186/100) ≈ 41.351\nP8 = 3.5 * 41.351 * (1 - 41.351/100) ≈ 80.731\nP9 = 3.5 * 80.731 * (1 - 80.731/100) ≈ 45.078\nP10 = 3.5 * 45.078 * (1 - 45.078/100) ≈ 77.546\n\nAfter 10 time steps, the population will be approximately 77.546 animals."
