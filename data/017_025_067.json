    "message_1": "How many non-isomorphic groups of order 120 are there, and what are their structures?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 120, we can use the following facts:\n\n1. The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group of order n is congruent to 1 modulo p and divides n.\n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is 2^3 * 3 * 5. Thus, we need to consider the Sylow 2-subgroups, Sylow 3-subgroups, and Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- 1 Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 (2^3)\n- 3 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 (2^2)\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- 1 Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3 (3^1)\n\nFor Sylow 5-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n- 1 Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5 (5^1)\n\nNow, we can combine these possibilities to form different groups of order 120:\n\n1. One group with 1 Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8, 1 Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, and 1 Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. This group is isomorphic to the symmetric group S5.\n\n2. One group with 3 Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4, 1 Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3, and 1 Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5. This group is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 and the cyclic group of order 2, denoted as A5 x C2.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 120, and their structures are S5 and A5 x C2."
