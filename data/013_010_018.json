    "message_1": "Consider two firms, A and B in a market producing identical goods. The market demand function is given by Q = 600 - 3P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price per unit. Both the firms can produce at a constant marginal cost of $10 per unit. Assume that both the firms make their production decisions simultaneously, and they choose their quantities to maximize profit. \n\nWhat is the Nash Equilibrium quantity produced by each firm in this Cournot duopoly game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash Equilibrium in this Cournot duopoly game, we first need to find the reaction functions for both firms A and B. The reaction function shows the optimal quantity produced by each firm given the quantity produced by the other firm.\n\nLet qA be the quantity produced by firm A and qB be the quantity produced by firm B. The total quantity produced in the market is Q = qA + qB. We can substitute this into the market demand function:\n\nQ = 600 - 3P\nqA + qB = 600 - 3P\n\nNow, we need to solve for P:\n\nP = (600 - qA - qB) / 3\n\nThe revenue for each firm is the price per unit multiplied by the quantity produced:\n\nRevenue_A = P * qA = qA * (600 - qA - qB) / 3\nRevenue_B = P * qB = qB * (600 - qA - qB) / 3\n\nThe cost for each firm is the marginal cost multiplied by the quantity produced:\n\nCost_A = 10 * qA\nCost_B = 10 * qB\n\nNow, we can find the profit for each firm by subtracting the cost from the revenue:\n\nProfit_A = Revenue_A - Cost_A = qA * (600 - qA - qB) / 3 - 10 * qA\nProfit_B = Revenue_B - Cost_B = qB * (600 - qA - qB) / 3 - 10 * qB\n\nTo find the reaction functions, we need to maximize the profit for each firm with respect to their own quantity produced. We can do this by taking the first derivative of the profit functions with respect to qA and qB and setting them equal to zero:\n\nd(Profit_A) / dqA = 0\nd(Profit_B) / dqB = 0\n\nTaking the derivatives and setting them equal to zero, we get:\n\n(600 - 2qA - qB) / 3 - 10 = 0\n(600 - qA - 2qB) / 3 - 10 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for qA and qB:\n\n600 - 2qA - qB = 30\n600 - qA - 2qB = 30\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\n\nqA = 180\nqB = 180\n\nSo, the Nash Equilibrium quantity produced by each firm in this Cournot duopoly game is 180 units for firm A and 180 units for firm B."
