    "message_1": "Assuming there are three farmers who share a water source, each farmer being able to allocate water for their crops independently, but the total water allocation cannot exceed 30 units, and they seek the maximum profit. Farmer 1 produces corn, earning $6 profit per unit of water used, Farmer 2 produces wheat, earning $5 profit per unit of water used, and Farmer 3 produces rice with $4 profit per unit of water used. The farmers do not cooperate with each other. What is the optimal allocation for each farmer?",
    "message_2": "Since the farmers do not cooperate with each other, they will each try to maximize their individual profit. The optimal allocation for each farmer can be determined by comparing the profit per unit of water used for each crop.\n\nFarmer 1: Corn - $6 profit per unit of water\nFarmer 2: Wheat - $5 profit per unit of water\nFarmer 3: Rice - $4 profit per unit of water\n\nThe total water allocation cannot exceed 30 units. Since corn has the highest profit per unit of water, Farmer 1 will try to use as much water as possible. However, since the water is shared, Farmer 1 can only use up to 30 units of water. Therefore, Farmer 1 will use all 30 units of water for corn production.\n\nFarmer 2 and Farmer 3 will not have any water left to allocate for their crops. Therefore, the optimal allocation for each farmer is:\n\nFarmer 1: 30 units of water for corn\nFarmer 2: 0 units of water for wheat\nFarmer 3: 0 units of water for rice"
