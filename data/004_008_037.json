    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 at the point (2, 17), we need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x, and then evaluate it at x = 2.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = d(3x^2 + 4x - 5)/dx = 6x + 4\n\nNow, we need to evaluate f'(x) at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 6(2) + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 at the point (2, 17) is 16."
