    "message_1": "A triangle has a known length of sides of 5 cm and 8 cm and an angle between these sides of 60 degrees. Find the length of the third side using the law of cosines.",
    "message_2": "We can use the law of cosines to find the length of the third side. Let the sides be a = 5 cm, b = 8 cm, and c as the unknown side. The angle between sides a and b is 60 degrees.\n\nThe law of cosines states: c² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C), where C is the angle between sides a and b.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nc² = (5)² + (8)² - 2(5)(8) * cos(60)\n\nc² = 25 + 64 - 80 * (1/2) [since cos(60) = 1/2]\n\nc² = 25 + 64 - 40\n\nc² = 89\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of side c:\n\nc = √89\n\nc ≈ 9.43 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side is approximately 9.43 cm."
