    "message_2": "To prove that G has an element of order 2, we will consider the possible orders of the elements in G. Let G = {e, a, b, c} be the group, where e is the identity element.\n\nCase 1: All elements have order 1 or 4.\nIn this case, the only element with order 1 is e, and the other three elements a, b, and c have order 4. Since the order of an element divides the order of the group, this case is not possible because 4 does not divide 4 three times.\n\nCase 2: There exists an element of order 2.\nIn this case, we are done since we have found an element of order 2.\n\nCase 3: There exists an element of order 4, and the other two non-identity elements have order 1.\nIn this case, let a have order 4. Then, a^4 = e. Since a has order 4, a^2 ≠ e. Now, let b and c be the other two non-identity elements. If b and c have order 1, then b^2 = c^2 = e. But this contradicts the fact that a^2 ≠ e, since a, b, and c are distinct elements. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nFrom the above cases, we see that the only possible case is Case 2, where there exists an element of order 2. Thus, there exist distinct elements a, b in G such that ab = e, and G has an element of order 2."
