The data is shown below:\n\n10,000, 12,000, 11,500, 13,000, 15,000, 16,500, 20,000, 18,000, 19,500, 22,000, 24,500, 25,000\n\nFind the following measures for this time series data:\na) Mean\nb) Median\nc) Mode\nd) Range\ne) Variance\nf) Standard deviation",

In this case, there are no repeated values, so there is no mode.\n\nd) Range:\nThe range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset.\n\nRange = 25,000 - 10,000\nRange = 15,000\n\ne) Variance:\nTo find the variance, we first find the difference between each value and the mean, square these differences, and then find the average of these squared differences.\n\nDifferences from the mean: -7,250, -5,250, -5,750, -4,250, -2,250, -750, 2,750, 750, 2,250, 4,750, 7,250, 7,750\nSquared differences: 52,562,500, 27,562,500, 33,062,500, 18,062,500, 5,062,500, 562,500, 7,562,500, 562,500, 5,062,500, 22,562,500, 52,562,500, 60,062,500\n\nSum of squared differences = 287,250,000\nVariance = Sum of squared differences / (Number of values - 1)\nVariance = 287,250,000 / 11\nVariance = 26,113,636.36\n\nf) Standard deviation:\nThe standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n\nStandard deviation = √26,113,636.36\nStandard deviation ≈ 5,110.57\n\nSo, the measures for this time series data are:\na) Mean: 17,250\nb) Median: 17,250\nc) Mode: None\nd) Range: 15,000\ne) Variance: 26,113,636.36\nf) Standard deviation: 5,110.57"
