    "message_2": "We are given the following congruences:\n\nx ≡ 7 (mod 10)\nx ≡ 9 (mod 13)\nx ≡ 11 (mod 15)\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences. First, we find the product of the moduli: N = 10 * 13 * 15 = 1950.\n\nNext, we compute the partial products:\n\nN1 = N / 10 = 195\nN2 = N / 13 = 150\nN3 = N / 15 = 130\n\nNow we need to find the modular inverses:\n\ny1 = N1^(-1) (mod 10) = 195^(-1) (mod 10)\ny2 = N2^(-1) (mod 13) = 150^(-1) (mod 13)\ny3 = N3^(-1) (mod 15) = 130^(-1) (mod 15)\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find:\n\ny1 = 3 (mod 10)\ny2 = 7 (mod 13)\ny3 = 7 (mod 15)\n\nNow we can find the solution:\n\nx = (7 * 195 * 3) + (9 * 150 * 7) + (11 * 130 * 7) = 4095 + 9450 + 10010 = 24555\n\nFinally, we take the result modulo N:\n\nx = 24555 (mod 1950) = 187\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given congruences is 187."
