    "message_2": "To find out how many students passed the exam, we need to calculate 70% of 350 students.\n\nTo do this, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of students passed = (Percentage of students passed / 100) * Total number of students\n\nNumber of students passed = (70 / 100) * 350\n\nNumber of students passed = 0.7 * 350\n\nNumber of students passed = 245\n\nSo, 245 students passed the exam."
