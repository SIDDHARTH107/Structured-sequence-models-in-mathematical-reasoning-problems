    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 30. By the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a subgroup of order 2 and a subgroup of order 3. Let's denote these subgroups as H and K, respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the elements of order 2 in G. If an element x has order 2, then x^2 = e (the identity element). Notice that x cannot be in K, because the order of elements in K must divide the order of K, which is 3. So, x must be in H.\n\nSince H has order 2, it has exactly two elements: e and some element a, where a^2 = e. Therefore, there is exactly one element of order 2 in G, which is the non-identity element of the subgroup H."
