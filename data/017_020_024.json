    "message_2": "To find the non-isomorphic groups of order 40, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5^1. \n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow 5-subgroups. By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^3 = 8, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The only possibility is n_5 = 1, which means there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 5-subgroup, which we'll denote as P_5.\n\nNow, let's consider the Sylow 2-subgroups. By Sylow's theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 5^1 = 5, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The possibilities for n_2 are 1 and 5. If n_2 = 1, there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 2-subgroup, which we'll denote as P_2.\n\nIf both P_2 and P_5 are normal, then the group is a direct product of P_2 and P_5. Since P_2 is a group of order 8 and P_5 is a group of order 5, we have:\n\n1. C_8 x C_5: This is isomorphic to the cyclic group C40.\n2. C_4 x C_2 x C_5: This is not isomorphic to C40 or D20.\n3. D_8 x C_5: This is isomorphic to the dihedral group D20.\n\nIf n_2 = 5, then there are 5 Sylow 2-subgroups, and we can't form a direct product. In this case, we have a semi-direct product of P_2 and P_5. Since P_5 is a cyclic group of order 5, there are 4 possible automorphisms. We can have:\n\n4. C_8 : C_5: This is not isomorphic to C40 or D20.\n5. C_4 x C_2 : C_5: This is not isomorphic to C40 or D20.\n\nSo, there are 5 non-isomorphic groups of order 40:\n\n1. C_40 (cyclic group)\n2. C_4 x C_2 x C_5\n3. D_20 (dihedral group)\n4. C_8 : C_5\n5. C_4 x C_2 : C_5\n\nNow, let's find the number of elements of order 2 in each non-abelian group of order 40. The non-abelian groups are:\n\n1. D_20\n2. C_8 : C_5\n3. C_4 x C_2 : C_5\n\n1. D_20: In a dihedral group D_n, there are n elements of order 2, which are the reflections. So, in D_20, there are 20 elements of order 2.\n\n2. C_8 : C_5: In this group, the elements of order 2 come from the Sylow 2-subgroup C_8. There are 3 elements of order 2 in C_8 (the non-identity elements of a C_2 x C_2 subgroup). So, there are 3 elements of order 2 in C_8 : C_5.\n\n3. C_4 x C_2 : C_5: In this group, the elements of order 2 come from the Sylow 2-subgroup C_4 x C_2. There are 1 element of order 2 in C_4 and 2 elements of order 2 in C_2. So, there are 1 + 2 = 3 elements of order 2 in C_4 x C_2 : C_5."
