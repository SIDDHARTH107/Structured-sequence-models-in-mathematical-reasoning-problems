    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. The first six Mersenne primes are M_2, M_3, M_5, M_7, M_13, and M_17. To find the 7th Mersenne prime, we need to find the next prime number for n and then calculate the corresponding Mersenne prime.\n\nThe next prime number after 17 is 19. So, the 7th Mersenne prime is M_19 = 2^19 - 1.\n\nM_19 = 2^19 - 1 = 524288 - 1 = 524287\n\nThe 7th Mersenne prime number is 524,287."
