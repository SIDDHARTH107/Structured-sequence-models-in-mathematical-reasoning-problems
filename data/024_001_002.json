    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the wire at t=2, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the given space curve r(t) = <3t, 4t^2, 5t^3>.\n\nFirst derivative (tangent vector):\nr'(t) = <3, 8t, 15t^2>\n\nSecond derivative (normal vector):\nr''(t) = <0, 8, 30t>\n\nNow, we need to find the magnitude of the tangent vector at t=2:\n|r'(2)| = |<3, 16, 60>| = √(3^2 + 16^2 + 60^2) = √(9 + 256 + 3600) = √(3865)\n\nNext, we find the cross product of the tangent vector and its derivative at t=2:\nr'(2) x r''(2) = <3, 16, 60> x <0, 8, 60>\n= <(16*60 - 60*8), -(3*60 - 0*60), (3*8 - 0*16)>\n= <960 - 480, -180, 24>\n= <480, -180, 24>\n\nNow, we find the magnitude of the cross product:\n| r'(2) x r''(2) | = |<480, -180, 24>| = √(480^2 + (-180)^2 + 24^2) = √(230400 + 32400 + 576) = √(263376) = 513\n\nNow we can find the curvature (k) at t=2:\nk = | r'(2) x r''(2) | / |r'(2)|^3 = 513 / (3865^(3/2)) ≈ 0.0042\n\nTo find the torsion, we first need to find the third derivative of the space curve:\nr'''(t) = <0, 0, 30>\n\nNow, we find the dot product of the second derivative and the third derivative at t=2:\nr''(2) • r'''(2) = <0, 8, 60> • <0, 0, 30> = 0*0 + 8*0 + 60*30 = 1800\n\nFinally, we can find the torsion (τ) at t=2:\nτ = (r'(2) x r''(2) • r'''(2)) / | r'(2) x r''(2) |^2 = 1800 / 513^2 ≈ 0.0068\n\nSo, the curvature of the wire at t=2 is approximately 0.0042, and the torsion is approximately 0.0068."
