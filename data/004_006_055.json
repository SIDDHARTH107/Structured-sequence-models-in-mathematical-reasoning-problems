    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 15x^2 + 36x, we first need to find its first derivative, f'(x), and then set it equal to zero to solve for the critical points.\n\n1. Find the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 - 15x^2 + 36x)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 30x + 36\n\n2. Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n6x^2 - 30x + 36 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can first simplify it by dividing all terms by 6:\n\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\n\nFrom this factored form, we can find the critical points by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 2 = 0 => x = 2\nx - 3 = 0 => x = 3\n\nSo, the critical points of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 15x^2 + 36x are x = 2 and x = 3."
