    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using LU decomposition, we first need to decompose the coefficient matrix A into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.\n\nThe given system of linear equations can be represented as:\n\nA = | 2  3  4 |      X = | x |      B = | 13 |\n    | 1  5  3 |          | y |          |  7 |\n    | 3  2  2 |          | z |          |  8 |\n\nNow, let's perform LU decomposition on matrix A:\n\n1. Divide the first row of A by 2 and store it in the first row of L:\n\nL = | 1    0    0 |\n    |      1    0 |\n    |           1 |\n\n2. Subtract the first row of A multiplied by the first element of the second row of L from the second row of A, and store the result in the second row of U:\n\nU = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 0  4  2 |\n    |         |\n\n3. Subtract the first row of A multiplied by the first element of the third row of L from the third row of A, and store the result in the third row of U:\n\nU = | 2  3  4 |\n    | 0  4  2 |\n    | 0 -1 -4 |\n\nNow we have the LU decomposition of A:\n\nA = L * U = | 1  0  0 | * | 2  3  4 |\n            | 1/2  1  0 |   | 0  4  2 |\n            | 3/2 -1/4 1 |   | 0 -1 -4 |\n\nNext, we solve the system L * Y = B for Y:\n\n| 1  0  0 | * | Y1 | = | 13 |\n| 1/2  1  0 |   | Y2 |   |  7 |\n| 3/2 -1/4 1 |   | Y3 |   |  8 |\n\nSolving for Y:\n\nY1 = 13\nY2 = 7 - (1/2) * 13 = 1/2\nY3 = 8 - (3/2) * 13 + (1/4) * 1/2 = -3\n\nSo, Y = | 13 |\n          | 1/2 |\n          | -3 |\n\nFinally, we solve the system U * X = Y for X:\n\n| 2  3  4 | * | x | = | 13  |\n| 0  4  2 |   | y |   | 1/2 |\n| 0 -1 -4 |   | z |   | -3  |\n\nSolving for X:\n\nz = (-3 + 1/2) / -4 = 5/8\ny = (1/2 - 2 * 5/8) / 4 = -1/8\nx = (13 - 3 * (-1/8) - 4 * 5/8) / 2 = 2\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = 2\ny = -1/8\nz = 5/8"
