Use a swarm size of 20 and a maximum of 100 iterations.",
    "message_2": "To solve this optimization problem using particle swarm optimization (PSO), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the swarm with random positions and velocities within the search space.\n2. Evaluate the fitness of each particle (i.e., the value of f(x, y) for each particle's position).\n3. Update each particle's personal best position if its current position has a better fitness.\n4. Update the global best position if any particle's personal best position has a better fitness.\n5. Update the velocities and positions of the particles based on their personal best and the global best positions.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 for the specified number of iterations (100 in this case).\n\nSince the actual implementation of PSO requires a programming language, I will provide a general outline of the algorithm. You can implement this algorithm in a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, MATLAB, etc.).\n\n1. Initialize the swarm:\n   - Create a 20x2 matrix for the particle positions, initialized with random values between -10 and 10.\n   - Create a 20x2 matrix for the particle velocities, initialized with random values between -1 and 1.\n   - Set the initial personal best positions to the initial particle positions.\n   - Evaluate the fitness of each particle and set the initial global best position to the position with the best fitness.\n\n2. For each iteration (1 to 100):\n   a. For each particle (1 to 20):\n      i. Evaluate the fitness of the particle's current position.\n      ii. If the current position has a better fitness than the particle's personal best, update the personal best position.\n      iii. If the particle's personal best position has a better fitness than the global best, update the global best position.\n   b. Update the velocities and positions of the particles:\n      - Use the standard PSO velocity update equation: v(t+1) = w * v(t) + c1 * r1 * (pbest - x(t)) + c2 * r2 * (gbest - x(t))\n        where w is the inertia weight, c1 and c2 are acceleration constants, r1 and r2 are random numbers between 0 and 1, pbest is the personal best position, and x(t) is the current position.\n      - Update the position using the equation: x(t+1) = x(t) + v(t+1)\n      - Make sure the updated positions are within the search space bounds (-10 <= x, y <= 10).\n\n3. After 100 iterations, the global best position will contain the approximate minimum value of f(x, y) and the corresponding values of x and y.\n\nNote that the PSO algorithm is a heuristic optimization method, and the solution may not be the exact global minimum. The quality of the solution depends on the parameter settings and the number of iterations. You may need to experiment with different parameter values to obtain a better solution."
