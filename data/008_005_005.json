    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using the method of elimination, we will first eliminate one variable from two of the equations, and then eliminate the same variable from the other two equations. This will result in a system of two equations with two variables, which can be solved using the same method.\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from equations (1) and (2)\n\nTo do this, we can multiply equation (1) by 2 and subtract it from equation (2):\n\n(4x - 2y - z) - 2(2x + 3y + z) = -6 - 2(7)\n\n4x - 2y - z - 4x - 6y - 2z = -6 - 14\n\n-8y - 3z = -20\n\nDivide by -1:\n\n8y + 3z = 20 (3)\n\nStep 2: Eliminate x from equations (1) and (3)\n\nTo do this, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (3):\n\n(x - y + 5z) - (2x + 3y + z) = 9 - 7\n\nx - y + 5z - 2x - 3y - z = 2\n\n-1x - 4y + 4z = 2\n\nDivide by -1:\n\nx + 4y - 4z = -2 (4)\n\nStep 3: Solve the system of two equations with two variables (3) and (4)\n\nWe can multiply equation (4) by 8 and add it to equation (3):\n\n8(x + 4y - 4z) + (8y + 3z) = 8(-2) + 20\n\n8x + 32y - 32z + 8y + 3z = -16 + 20\n\n8x + 40y - 29z = 4\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for x from equation (4) into this equation:\n\n8(4y - 4z - 2) + 40y - 29z = 4\n\n32y - 32z - 16 + 40y - 29z = 4\n\n72y - 61z = 20\n\nNow we can solve for y:\n\ny = (20 + 61z) / 72\n\nStep 4: Substitute the expression for y back into equation (4) to find x:\n\nx = 4(20 + 61z)/72 - 4z - 2\n\nx = (80 + 244z)/72 - 4z - 2\n\nStep 5: Substitute the expressions for x and y back into one of the original equations to find z:\n\n2((80 + 244z)/72 - 4z - 2) + 3(20 + 61z)/72 + z = 7\n\nAfter simplifying and solving for z, we get:\n\nz = 1\n\nStep 6: Substitute the value of z back into the expressions for x and y:\n\ny = (20 + 61(1))/72\n\ny = 81/72\n\ny = 9/8\n\nx = (80 + 244(1))/72 - 4(1) - 2\n\nx = 324/72 - 6\n\nx = 9/2 - 6\n\nx = 1/2\n\nSo the solution to the system of equations is:\n\nx = 1/2, y = 9/8, z = 1"
