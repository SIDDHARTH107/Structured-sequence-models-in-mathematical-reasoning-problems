    "message_1": "A company has a total of 500 hours of labor and 800 units of raw material available to produce two products A and B. Each unit of product A requires 3 hours of labor and 2 units of raw material, while each unit of product B requires 2 hours of labor and 1 unit of raw material. If the profit for each unit of product A is $50 and for product B is $30, how many units of each product should the company produce in order to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and raw material can be written as:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 500 (labor constraint)\n2x + y ≤ 800 (raw material constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\n\nP = 50x + 30y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n3x + 2y = 500\ny = (500 - 3x) / 2\n\n2x + y = 800\ny = 800 - 2x\n\nThe feasible region is the area where both constraints are satisfied. We will find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations:\n\n1) Intersection of labor constraint and x-axis (y=0):\n3x + 2(0) = 500\nx = 500 / 3 ≈ 166.67\n\n2) Intersection of labor constraint and y-axis (x=0):\n3(0) + 2y = 500\ny = 500 / 2 = 250\n\n3) Intersection of raw material constraint and x-axis (y=0):\n2x + 0 = 800\nx = 800 / 2 = 400\n\n4) Intersection of raw material constraint and y-axis (x=0):\n2(0) + y = 800\ny = 800\n\n5) Intersection of labor constraint and raw material constraint:\n3x + 2y = 500\n2x + y = 800\n\nSolving this system of equations:\n\nx = 100\ny = 600 - 2(100) = 400\n\nHowever, this point is not in the feasible region since it does not satisfy the labor constraint. So, we only need to consider the vertices (166.67, 0), (0, 250), and (400, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the profit function at these vertices:\n\nP(166.67, 0) = 50(166.67) + 30(0) ≈ 8333.5\nP(0, 250) = 50(0) + 30(250) = 7500\nP(400, 0) = 50(400) + 30(0) = 20000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 400 units of product A and 0 units of product B, with a profit of $20,000."
