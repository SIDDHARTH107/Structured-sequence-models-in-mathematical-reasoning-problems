    "message_2": "In a right triangle, if we know the length of the hypotenuse and one of the acute angles, we can use the sine and cosine functions to find the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's denote the side opposite the 30-degree angle as \"a\" and the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle as \"b\". We can use the sine and cosine functions as follows:\n\nsin(30) = a / 10\ncos(30) = b / 10\n\nNow, we know that sin(30) = 1/2 and cos(30) = √3/2. So, we can find the lengths of sides a and b:\n\na = 10 * (1/2) = 5 cm\nb = 10 * (√3/2) = 5√3 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of both sides, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height\nArea = (1/2) * a * b\nArea = (1/2) * 5 * 5√3\nArea = 25√3/2 cm²"
