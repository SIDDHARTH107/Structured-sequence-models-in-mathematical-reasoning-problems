    "message_2": "To choose 3 people from a group of 8, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people (8 in this case) and k is the number of people we want to choose (3 in this case). The exclamation mark denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 people from a group of 8 is:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!)\n= 8! / (3!5!)\n= (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1)(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n= (8 × 7 × 6) / (3 × 2 × 1)\n= 336 / 6\n= 56\n\nThere are 56 ways to choose 3 people from a group of 8 to form a committee."
