Determine the Lie derivative of $V$ with respect to the vector field $W = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ on $M$ at the point $(1,2)$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of the vector field $V$ with respect to the vector field $W$, we use the Lie bracket $[W, V]$. The Lie bracket is defined as:\n\n$$[W, V] = (W(V^i) - V(W^i))\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$$\n\nwhere $V^i$ and $W^i$ are the components of the vector fields $V$ and $W$, respectively, and the summation over $i$ is implied.\n\nIn our case, $V = x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 2y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ and $W = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$. Thus, the components are:\n\n$$V^1 = x, \\quad V^2 = 2y, \\quad W^1 = 1, \\quad W^2 = 1$$\n\nNow, we compute the Lie bracket:\n\n$$[W, V] = (W(V^1) - V(W^1))\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + (W(V^2) - V(W^2))\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$$\n\nFirst, we compute $W(V^1)$ and $V(W^1)$:\n\n$$W(V^1) = W(x) = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y} = 1 + 0 = 1$$\n\n$$V(W^1) = V(1) = x \\frac{\\partial 1}{\\partial x} + 2y \\frac{\\partial 1}{\\partial y} = 0 + 0 = 0$$\n\nNext, we compute $W(V^2)$ and $V(W^2)$:\n\n$$W(V^2) = W(2y) = \\frac{\\partial (2y)}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial (2y)}{\\partial y} = 0 + 2 = 2$$\n\n$$V(W^2) = V(1) = x \\frac{\\partial 1}{\\partial x} + 2y \\frac{\\partial 1}{\\partial y} = 0 + 0 = 0$$\n\nNow, we plug these results into the Lie bracket formula:\n\n$$[W, V] = (1 - 0)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + (2 - 0)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the Lie derivative at the point $(1, 2)$:\n\n$$[W, V](1, 2) = \\left.\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right)\\right|_{(1, 2)}$$\n\nSince the Lie derivative is a vector field, the result is still a vector field, and its value at the point $(1, 2)$ is:\n\n$$[W, V](1, 2) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + 2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$$"
