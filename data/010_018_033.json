    "message_2": "To calculate the Euler characteristic of a Morse-Smale complex, we need to count the number of critical points of each Morse index and alternate the signs in the sum. The Euler characteristic (χ) is given by the formula:\n\nχ = (# of index 0 critical points) - (# of index 1 critical points) + (# of index 2 critical points) - (# of index 3 critical points) + ...\n\nIn this problem, we have the following critical points:\n\n- 3 local maximums, which are index 0 critical points.\n- 4 saddle points with Morse indices 1, 2, 2, and 3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the Euler characteristic:\n\nχ = (3) - (1) + (2) - (1) = 3 - 1 + 2 - 1 = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the Euler characteristic of this Morse-Smale complex is 3."
