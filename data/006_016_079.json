    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant produces 10,000 units of a particular product daily. Based on previous data, 7% of the product is expected to have a certain type of defect. What is the probability that at least 700 units will have this defect in a day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective units\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of units produced (10,000)\n- k is the number of defective units (at least 700)\n- p is the probability of a unit being defective (0.07)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a unit not being defective (0.93)\n\nHowever, calculating the probability of having at least 700 defective units (700, 701, 702, ..., 10,000) using the binomial formula directly would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, which is more suitable for large sample sizes like this one.\n\nThe normal approximation involves finding the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution and then using the standard normal (Z) distribution to find the probability. The formulas for the mean and standard deviation are:\n\nμ = n * p\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p))\n\nFor our problem, the mean and standard deviation are:\n\nμ = 10,000 * 0.07 = 700\nσ = sqrt(10,000 * 0.07 * 0.93) ≈ 25.79\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of having at least 700 defective units. We can use the Z-score formula to convert 700 to a Z-score:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nFor X = 700:\n\nZ = (700 - 700) / 25.79 = 0\n\nSince we want the probability of having at least 700 defective units, we need to find the area to the right of Z = 0 in the standard normal distribution. The area to the left of Z = 0 is 0.5 (since the standard normal distribution is symmetric around 0), so the area to the right of Z = 0 is also 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the probability of having at least 700 defective units in a day is approximately 0.5 or 50%."
