    "message_2": "To find the x-intercept, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 2x + 3\n-3 = 2x\nx = -3/2\n\nSo the x-intercept is (-3/2, 0).\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\ny = 2(0) + 3\ny = 3\n\nSo the y-intercept is (0, 3).\n\nNow let's find two other points on the line. We can choose any x values and plug them into the equation to find the corresponding y values.\n\nLet's choose x = 1:\n\ny = 2(1) + 3\ny = 5\n\nSo one point is (1, 5).\n\nNow let's choose x = -1:\n\ny = 2(-1) + 3\ny = 1\n\nSo another point is (-1, 1).\n\nIn summary, we have the following points on the line:\nx-intercept: (-3/2, 0)\ny-intercept: (0, 3)\nOther points: (1, 5) and (-1, 1)"
