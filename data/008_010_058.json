    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method, we'll first write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n|  2  1 -1 |  5\n|  4 -3  5 | -7\n|  1 -1  3 | 10\n```\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\n\nWe'll use the first row as the pivot row. To eliminate x from the second row, we'll subtract twice the first row from the second row:\n\n```\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\n```\n\n```\n|  2  1 -1 |  5\n|  0 -5  7 | -17\n|  1 -1  3 | 10\n```\n\nNow, we'll eliminate x from the third row by subtracting the first row from the third row:\n\n```\nR3 = R3 - R1\n```\n\n```\n|  2  1 -1 |  5\n|  0 -5  7 | -17\n|  0 -2  4 |  5\n```\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\n\nWe'll use the second row as the pivot row. To eliminate y from the third row, we'll add 2/5 times the second row to the third row:\n\n```\nR3 = R3 + (2/5) * R2\n```\n\n```\n|  2  1 -1 |  5\n|  0 -5  7 | -17\n|  0  0  2 | -1\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve for z.\n\nNow, we have an upper triangular matrix, and we can solve for z using back-substitution:\n\n```\n2z = -1\nz = -1/2\n```\n\nStep 4: Solve for y.\n\nSubstitute the value of z back into the second row equation to solve for y:\n\n```\n-5y + 7(-1/2) = -17\n-5y - 7/2 = -17\n-5y = -24/2\ny = 24/10\ny = 12/5\n```\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n\nSubstitute the values of y and z back into the first row equation to solve for x:\n\n```\n2x + 12/5 - (-1/2) = 5\n2x + 12/5 + 1/2 = 5\n2x = 5 - 12/5 - 1/2\n2x = (25 - 12 - 5)/10\n2x = 8/10\nx = 4/5\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = 4/5\ny = 12/5\nz = -1/2\n```"
