    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one accident occurring in the factory over 5 years, we can use the Poisson distribution formula. The Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere X is the number of accidents, k is the number of occurrences, λ is the average rate of occurrence (in this case, accidents per year), and e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n\nSince the factory has an average of 2 accidents per year and has been in operation for 5 years, the total average number of accidents over the 5-year period is:\n\nλ = 2 accidents/year * 5 years = 10 accidents\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of at least one accident occurring. To do this, it's easier to find the probability of no accidents occurring and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, let's find the probability of no accidents (k = 0) occurring over the 5-year period:\n\nP(X = 0) = (e^(-10) * 10^0) / 0! = (e^(-10) * 1) / 1 = e^(-10)\n\nNow, we'll find the probability of at least one accident occurring by subtracting the probability of no accidents from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - e^(-10)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(X ≥ 1) ≈ 1 - 0.0000454 ≈ 0.9999546\n\nSo, the probability of at least one machinery accident occurring in the factory over the 5-year period is approximately 99.995%."
