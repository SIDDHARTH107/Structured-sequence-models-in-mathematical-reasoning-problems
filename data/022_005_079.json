    "message_2": "To find the residues of f(z) at z = 0 and z = 1, we first need to identify the singularities of the function. The singularities occur when the denominator is equal to zero, which is when z^2 - z = 0. Factoring the denominator, we get z(z - 1) = 0, so the singularities are at z = 0 and z = 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the residues at these singularities. Since both singularities are simple poles (i.e., they have a multiplicity of 1), we can use the following formula for the residue:\n\nRes[f(z), z0] = lim (z -> z0) [(z - z0) * f(z)]\n\n1. Residue at z = 0:\n\nRes[f(z), 0] = lim (z -> 0) [(z - 0) * f(z)]\n= lim (z -> 0) [z * (z^3 + 1) / (z^2 - z)]\n= lim (z -> 0) [(z^4 + z) / (z^2 - z)]\n\nTo evaluate this limit, we can use L'Hôpital's rule, which states that if the limit of the ratio of the derivatives of the numerator and denominator exists, then the limit of the original function exists and is equal to that limit:\n\nlim (z -> 0) [(z^4 + z) / (z^2 - z)] = lim (z -> 0) [(4z^3 + 1) / (2z - 1)]\n\nNow, plugging in z = 0, we get:\n\n(4(0)^3 + 1) / (2(0) - 1) = 1 / (-1) = -1\n\nSo, the residue of f(z) at z = 0 is -1.\n\n2. Residue at z = 1:\n\nRes[f(z), 1] = lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1) * f(z)]\n= lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1) * (z^3 + 1) / (z^2 - z)]\n= lim (z -> 1) [(z^4 - z^3) / (z^2 - z)]\n\nAgain, we can use L'Hôpital's rule:\n\nlim (z -> 1) [(z^4 - z^3) / (z^2 - z)] = lim (z -> 1) [(4z^3 - 3z^2) / (2z - 1)]\n\nNow, plugging in z = 1, we get:\n\n(4(1)^3 - 3(1)^2) / (2(1) - 1) = (4 - 3) / (2 - 1) = 1 / 1 = 1\n\nSo, the residue of f(z) at z = 1 is 1.\n\nIn summary, the residues of f(z) at z = 0 and z = 1 are -1 and 1, respectively."
