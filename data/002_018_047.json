    "message_2": "A sphere inscribed in a cube touches all the faces of the cube. Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube.\n\nThe diameter of the sphere is 6 cm, so its radius (r) is half of that, which is 3 cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume (V) of a sphere is:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * r^3\n\nSubstitute the radius (r = 3 cm) into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * π * (3^3)\n\nV = (4/3) * π * 27\n\nV = 36π cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is 36π cubic centimeters."
