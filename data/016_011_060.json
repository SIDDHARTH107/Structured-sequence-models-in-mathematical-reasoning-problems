    "message_2": "The Vicsek fractal is formed by dividing the initial square into 9 smaller squares (3x3 grid) and keeping the middle square and the four corner squares in each iteration.\n\nIn the first iteration, we have 5 squares, each with a side length of 1/3 units.\nIn the second iteration, we have 5^2 = 25 squares, each with a side length of (1/3)^2 = 1/9 units.\nIn the third iteration, we have 5^3 = 125 squares, each with a side length of (1/3)^3 = 1/27 units.\n\nThe scaling factor of the third iteration of the Vicsek fractal is the ratio of the side length of the squares in the third iteration to the side length of the initial square, which is:\n\nScaling factor = (Side length of squares in the third iteration) / (Side length of the initial square)\nScaling factor = (1/27) / 1 = 1/27"
