    "message_1": "A Peano curve is constructed by dividing a square into nine equal squares, removing the square in the center, and recursively replacing each square with the original shape. If the original square has a side length of 1 unit, what is the length of the resulting Peano curve after 4 iterations?",
    "message_2": "After each iteration, the length of the Peano curve is multiplied by 8/3, since there are 8 smaller squares, each with a side length of 1/3 of the original square.\n\nAfter 4 iterations, the length of the Peano curve will be:\n\n(1) * (8/3)^4 = (8^4) / (3^4) = 4096 / 81 â‰ˆ 50.567\n\nSo, the length of the resulting Peano curve after 4 iterations is approximately 50.567 units."
