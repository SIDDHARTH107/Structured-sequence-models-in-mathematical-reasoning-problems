    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers every vertex exactly once. In this graph, there is no perfect matching because there are an odd number of vertices (7). In a graph with an odd number of vertices, it is impossible to have a perfect matching, as each edge can only cover two vertices, and an odd number of vertices cannot be evenly divided by two."
