    "message_1": "A message has been encoded using a substitution cipher. After applying frequency analysis, the 3 most common letters found in the encoded message were 'R', 'A', and 'E'. What are the 3 most likely letters in the original message that correspond to these encrypted letters?",
    "message_2": "The three most common letters in the English language are 'E', 'T', and 'A'. Since 'R', 'A', and 'E' are the most common letters in the encoded message, it is likely that they correspond to 'E', 'T', and 'A' in the original message. However, the exact correspondence cannot be determined without more information about the substitution cipher used."
