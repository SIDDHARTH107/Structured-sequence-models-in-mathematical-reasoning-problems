    "message_1": "Suppose that Alice owns either a car or a bike, but not both. She always uses one of them to commute to work. If we know that Alice used a vehicle to travel to work today, and that vehicle has the property that if it were a bike, Alice would have arrived 10 minutes earlier than she actually did, whereas if it were a car, she would have arrived 5 minutes later than she actually did, then how long did Alice take to commute to work today?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the time Alice took to commute to work today. If Alice used a bike, she would have taken x - 10 minutes, and if she used a car, she would have taken x + 5 minutes.\n\nAccording to the given information, if the vehicle she used were a bike, she would have arrived 10 minutes earlier, which means she actually took x - 10 minutes to commute. On the other hand, if the vehicle she used were a car, she would have arrived 5 minutes later, which means she actually took x + 5 minutes to commute.\n\nSince Alice owns either a car or a bike but not both, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx - 10 = x + 5\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n-10 = 5\nThis equation has no solution, which means there is an inconsistency in the given information. It is not possible to determine how long Alice took to commute to work today based on the provided information."
