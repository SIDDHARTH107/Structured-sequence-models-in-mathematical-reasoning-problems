    "message_1": "Suppose a manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B. The company can use two machines to manufacture these products. Machine 1 can produce both types of products but Machine 2 can only produce product A. The production time for product A using Machine 1 is 2 hours and for Machine 2 is 3 hours. The production time for product B using Machine 1 is 1 hour.\n\nThe company has a limited number of operating hours for each machine in a week. Machine 1 can operate for at most 40 hours and Machine 2 can operate for 20 hours in a week. The profit for each unit of product A is \\$10 and for product B is \\$5. How many units of each product should the company produce in a week to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced by Machine 1, y be the number of units of product A produced by Machine 2, and z be the number of units of product B produced by Machine 1.\n\nThe total production time for Machine 1 is 2x + z, and for Machine 2 is 3y. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. 2x + z ≤ 40 (Machine 1 operating hours constraint)\n2. 3y ≤ 20 (Machine 2 operating hours constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is P = 10(x + y) + 5z.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region for the constraints. From constraint 1, we get z ≤ 40 - 2x. From constraint 2, we get y ≤ 20/3.\n\nNow we need to find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. (0, 0, 0) - Origin\n2. (0, 20/3, 0) - Intersection of y-axis and constraint 2\n3. (0, 0, 40) - Intersection of z-axis and constraint 1\n4. (20, 0, 0) - Intersection of x-axis and constraint 1\n\nNow we need to evaluate the objective function P at each corner point:\n\n1. P(0, 0, 0) = 10(0 + 0) + 5(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 20/3, 0) = 10(0 + 20/3) + 5(0) = 200/3 ≈ 66.67\n3. P(0, 0, 40) = 10(0 + 0) + 5(40) = 200\n4. P(20, 0, 0) = 10(20 + 0) + 5(0) = 200\n\nComparing the profits, we can see that producing 40 units of product B using Machine 1 (P(0, 0, 40) = 200) or producing 20 units of product A using Machine 1 (P(20, 0, 0) = 200) will both result in the maximum profit of $200 per week. The company can choose either of these production plans to maximize their profit."
