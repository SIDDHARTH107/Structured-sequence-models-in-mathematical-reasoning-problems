The distance matrix between these locations is given below:\n\n|   | A | B | C | D |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A | 0 | 10 | 15 | 20 |\n| B | 10 | 0 | 35 | 25 |\n| C | 15 | 35 | 0 | 30 |\n| D | 20 | 25 | 30 | 0 |\n\nThe truck needs to find the optimal route that minimizes the total distance traveled, starting and ending at location A and passing through all locations only once. What is the optimal route and what is the total distance traveled?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal route, we need to calculate the distances for all possible routes and choose the one with the minimum distance. The possible routes are:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → A\n2. A → B → D → C → A\n3. A → C → B → D → A\n4. A → C → D → B → A\n5. A → D → B → C → A\n6. A → D → C → B → A\n\nNow, let's calculate the distances for each route:\n\n1. A → B → C → D → A: 10 + 35 + 30 + 20 = 95\n2. A → B → D → C → A: 10 + 25 + 30 + 15 = 80\n3. A → C → B → D → A: 15 + 35 + 25 + 20 = 95\n4. A → C → D → B → A: 15 + 30 + 25 + 10 = 80\n5. A → D → B → C → A: 20 + 25 + 35 + 15 = 95\n6. A → D → C → B → A: 20 + 30 + 35 + 10 = 95\n\nComparing the distances, we can see that the minimum distance is 80, which corresponds to routes 2 and 4:\n\n- A → B → D → C → A\n- A → C → D → B → A\n\nBoth of these routes have the same total distance of 80, so either one can be considered the optimal route."
