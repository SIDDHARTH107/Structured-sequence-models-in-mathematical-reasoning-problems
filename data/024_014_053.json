Consider a vector field $X=x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ on $M$, where $(x,y)$ are standard coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Determine the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to $X$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to the vector field $X$, we need to apply the action of $X$ on the function $f$. In other words, we need to compute the directional derivative of $f$ along the vector field $X$. This can be done using the following formula:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = X(f) = x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$$\n\nHere, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$ are the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to $x$ and $y$, respectively. Thus, the Lie derivative of $f$ with respect to $X$ is given by the expression:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}_X f = x\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$$"
