    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle, is a fractal that is formed by repeatedly removing smaller triangles from an initial equilateral triangle.\n\nIn the first iteration, there is 1 triangle.\nIn the second iteration, 4 triangles are formed (1 large triangle and 3 smaller ones).\nIn the third iteration, each of the 4 triangles from the second iteration is replaced by 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 4 * 4 = 16 triangles.\n\nIn the fourth iteration, each of the 16 triangles from the third iteration is replaced by 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 16 * 4 = 64 triangles.\n\nSo, the total number of triangles in the 4th iteration of the Sierpinski pyramid is 64."
