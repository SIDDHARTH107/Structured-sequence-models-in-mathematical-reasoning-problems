    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology group $H^1([0,1], G/F)$, we first need to understand the sheaf $G/F$. For any open set $U \\subset [0,1]$, we have\n\n$$(G/F)(U) = G(U)/F(U) = \\{f \\in C^0(U) \\mid \\int_0^1 f(x)dx = 0\\}/\\{f \\in C^1(U)\\}.$$\n\nNow, consider the Čech cohomology for the sheaf $G/F$. Let $\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_i\\}$ be an open cover of $[0,1]$. We can compute the Čech cohomology groups $\\check{C}^p(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$ and their coboundary maps $\\delta: \\check{C}^p(\\mathcal{U}, G/F) \\to \\check{C}^{p+1}(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$.\n\nFor $p=0$, the Čech cochain group $\\check{C}^0(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$ consists of functions in $G(U_i)/F(U_i)$ for each $U_i$. The coboundary map $\\delta: \\check{C}^0(\\mathcal{U}, G/F) \\to \\check{C}^1(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$ sends a 0-cochain $f_i \\in G(U_i)/F(U_i)$ to the 1-cochain $f_i - f_j \\in G(U_i \\cap U_j)/F(U_i \\cap U_j)$.\n\nFor $p=1$, the Čech cochain group $\\check{C}^1(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$ consists of functions in $G(U_i \\cap U_j)/F(U_i \\cap U_j)$ for each pair of indices $i$ and $j$. The coboundary map $\\delta: \\check{C}^1(\\mathcal{U}, G/F) \\to \\check{C}^2(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$ is trivial since there are no nonempty triple intersections in the open cover of the interval $[0,1]$.\n\nNow, we can compute the cohomology group $H^1([0,1], G/F)$ as the kernel of the coboundary map $\\delta: \\check{C}^1(\\mathcal{U}, G/F) \\to \\check{C}^2(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$ modulo the image of the coboundary map $\\delta: \\check{C}^0(\\mathcal{U}, G/F) \\to \\check{C}^1(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$.\n\nSince the coboundary map $\\delta: \\check{C}^1(\\mathcal{U}, G/F) \\to \\check{C}^2(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$ is trivial, the kernel consists of all 1-cochains in $\\check{C}^1(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$. The image of the coboundary map $\\delta: \\check{C}^0(\\mathcal{U}, G/F) \\to \\check{C}^1(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$ consists of 1-cochains of the form $f_i - f_j$ for some 0-cochains $f_i, f_j \\in G(U_i)/F(U_i)$.\n\nThus, the cohomology group $H^1([0,1], G/F)$ consists of equivalence classes of 1-cochains in $\\check{C}^1(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$, where two 1-cochains are equivalent if they differ by a coboundary of the form $f_i - f_j$ for some 0-cochains $f_i, f_j \\in G(U_i)/F(U_i)$.\n\nNow, let $g_{ij} \\in G(U_i \\cap U_j)/F(U_i \\cap U_j)$ be a 1-cochain in $\\check{C}^1(\\mathcal{U}, G/F)$. We can write $g_{ij} = h_i - h_j$ for some functions $h_i \\in G(U_i)/F(U_i)$ and $h_j \\in G(U_j)/F(U_j)$. Since $g_{ij}$ is a continuous function with zero integral over $[0,1]$, we can find a differentiable function $f_{ij} \\in F(U_i \\cap U_j)$ such that $g_{ij} = f_{ij}'$. Then, $h_i - h_j = f_{ij}'$, and $h_i = h_j + f_{ij}'$.\n\nThis shows that any 1-cochain $g_{ij}$ can be written as a coboundary of the form $f_i - f_j$ for some 0-cochains $f_i, f_j \\in G(U_i)/F(U_i)$. Therefore, the cohomology group $H^1([0,1], G/F)$ is trivial, i.e., $H^1([0,1], G/F) = 0$."
