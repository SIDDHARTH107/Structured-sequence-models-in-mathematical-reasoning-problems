    "message_2": "To calculate the median, mode, and range of the quiz scores, we first need to organize the data in ascending order:\n\n9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 14, 15, 15, 16, 16, 17, 17, 18, 18, 19, 20, 20, 22\n\nMedian:\nThe median is the middle value of the dataset when it is ordered. Since there are 25 students (an odd number), the median will be the value at the 13th position.\n\nMedian = 14\n\nMode:\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.\n\nMode = 12 (it appears 4 times)\n\nRange:\nThe range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset.\n\nRange = 22 - 9 = 13\n\nSo, the median is 14, the mode is 12, and the range is 13."
