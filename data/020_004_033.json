The profit per unit is $10 for product A and $15 for product B. The factory can produce a maximum of 500 units of product A and 300 units of product B. The factory also has a total of 800 hours of labor available. It takes 2 hours to produce one unit of product A and 3 hours to produce one unit of product B. What is the optimal combination of units of product A and product B that the factory should produce in order to maximize the profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nObjective function (profit): P = 10x + 15y\n\nConstraints:\n1. x ≤ 500 (maximum units of product A)\n2. y ≤ 300 (maximum units of product B)\n3. 2x + 3y ≤ 800 (total labor hours)\n\nWe need to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize the profit P, subject to the given constraints.\n\nFirst, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x = 500 (vertical line)\n2. y = 300 (horizontal line)\n3. 2x + 3y = 800 -> y = (800 - 2x) / 3 (sloping line)\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at points (0, 0), (500, 0), (0, 300), and (400, 100).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the objective function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(500, 0) = 10(500) + 15(0) = $5,000\n3. P(0, 300) = 10(0) + 15(300) = $4,500\n4. P(400, 100) = 10(400) + 15(100) = $7,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $7,000, which occurs when the factory produces 400 units of product A and 100 units of product B."
