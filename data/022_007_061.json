    "message_1": "What is the maximum number of roots that a polynomial of degree 4 with real coefficients can have? \n\nHint: Use Liouville's theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "The fundamental theorem of algebra states that a polynomial of degree n with complex coefficients has exactly n roots, counting multiplicity. In our case, we have a polynomial of degree 4 with real coefficients. Since real numbers are a subset of complex numbers, the fundamental theorem of algebra still applies.\n\nTherefore, a polynomial of degree 4 with real coefficients can have a maximum of 4 roots. Note that some of these roots may be complex, but the total number of roots (including real and complex) will not exceed 4."
