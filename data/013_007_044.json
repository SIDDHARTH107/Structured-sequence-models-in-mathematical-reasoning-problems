    "message_1": "One mathematical problem related to the tragedy of the commons could be:\n\nIn a community of farmers, there is a shared grazing land for their cattle. Each farmer has 5 cows, and the land can support 50 cows in total. The current level of grazing is causing damage to the land, and the community has agreed to limit the number of cows grazing on the land to 30. However, if one farmer takes care of one extra cow, they will gain a profit of $10 per day at the expense of the others. If all farmers try to maximize their profit, how many cows will be grazing on the land per day? What will be the total profit earned by the farmers per day?",
    "message_2": "Let's assume there are N farmers in the community. Since the land can support 50 cows in total, we have:\n\n5N = 50\nN = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 farmers in the community.\n\nThe community has agreed to limit the number of cows grazing on the land to 30. If all farmers follow this agreement, each farmer would have to reduce their number of cows grazing on the land. The total number of cows grazing would be:\n\n30 cows / 10 farmers = 3 cows per farmer\n\nHowever, if one farmer decides to maximize their profit by adding one extra cow, they will gain a profit of $10 per day at the expense of the others. If all farmers try to maximize their profit, they will all add one extra cow, resulting in:\n\n3 cows per farmer + 1 extra cow = 4 cows per farmer\n\nSince there are 10 farmers, the total number of cows grazing on the land per day would be:\n\n4 cows per farmer * 10 farmers = 40 cows\n\nThis is more than the agreed-upon limit of 30 cows, but it is still within the land's capacity of 50 cows.\n\nThe total profit earned by the farmers per day would be:\n\n1 extra cow per farmer * $10 per cow * 10 farmers = $100 per day\n\nSo, if all farmers try to maximize their profit, there will be 40 cows grazing on the land per day, and the total profit earned by the farmers will be $100 per day."
