    "message_2": "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, we first check if it is an exact differential equation. An exact differential equation is of the form M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0, where M and N are functions of x and y, and the following condition holds:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x}$$\n\nIn our case, M(x, y) = x^2 + 4y^2 and N(x, y) = 4xy. Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = 8y$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x} = 4y$$\n\nSince the condition is not satisfied, the given differential equation is not exact. However, we can try to find an integrating factor to make it exact. Let's denote the integrating factor as µ(x, y). We want to find µ such that:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial (µM)}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial (µN)}{\\partial x}$$\n\nDividing both sides by µMN, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{M}\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} - \\frac{1}{N}\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{µ}\\frac{\\partial µ}{\\partial x} - \\frac{1}{µ}\\frac{\\partial µ}{\\partial y}$$\n\nNow, let's plug in the values of M, N, and their partial derivatives:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{x^2 + 4y^2}(8y) - \\frac{1}{4xy}(4y) = \\frac{1}{µ}\\frac{\\partial µ}{\\partial x} - \\frac{1}{µ}\\frac{\\partial µ}{\\partial y}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{8y}{x^2 + 4y^2} - \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{µ}\\frac{\\partial µ}{\\partial x} - \\frac{1}{µ}\\frac{\\partial µ}{\\partial y}$$\n\nNotice that the left side of the equation is a function of x and y only, which means that µ must be a function of x only. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$\\frac{8y}{x^2 + 4y^2} - \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{µ}\\frac{dµ}{dx}$$\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n$$\\int \\left(\\frac{8y}{x^2 + 4y^2} - \\frac{1}{x}\\right) dx = \\int \\frac{1}{µ} dµ$$\n\nIntegrating, we get:\n\n$$4\\ln(x^2 + 4y^2) - \\ln(x) = \\ln(µ) + C$$\n\nTaking the exponential of both sides, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{x^4 (x^2 + 4y^2)^4}{x} = µe^C$$\n\nSince we only need the integrating factor µ(x), we can ignore the constant e^C:\n\n$$µ(x) = \\frac{x^3 (x^2 + 4y^2)^4}{x} = x^2 (x^2 + 4y^2)^4$$\n\nNow, we can multiply the original differential equation by the integrating factor µ(x):\n\n$$(x^2 (x^2 + 4y^2)^4)(x^2 + 4y^2)dx + (x^2 (x^2 + 4y^2)^4)(4xy)dy = 0$$\n\nNow, the differential equation is exact, and we can find the general solution by integrating M(x, y) with respect to x and N(x, y) with respect to y:\n\n$$\\int (x^2 (x^2 + 4y^2)^5) dx = \\int (4x^3y(x^2 + 4y^2)^4) dy$$\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{8}(x^2 + 4y^2)^6 = x^2 (x^2 + 4y^2)^4 + C$$\n\nThus, the general solution of the given differential equation is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{8}(x^2 + 4y^2)^6 = x^2 (x^2 + 4y^2)^4 + C$$"
