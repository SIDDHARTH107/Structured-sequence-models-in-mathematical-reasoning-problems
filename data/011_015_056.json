    "message_1": "In a group of 6 people, what is the minimum number of handshakes that must occur for there to be either 3 people who have shaken hands with each other, or 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other?",
    "message_2": "This problem can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: At least one person shakes hands with at least 3 other people.\nIn this case, we have a group of 3 people who have shaken hands with each other. The minimum number of handshakes in this case is 3.\n\nCase 2: Every person shakes hands with exactly 2 other people.\nIn this case, we can represent the handshakes as a cycle. Since there are 6 people, the cycle must be of length 6. However, this is not possible because we need at least 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other. So, we must have a cycle of length 3, which means there are 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other. The minimum number of handshakes in this case is also 3.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of handshakes that must occur for there to be either 3 people who have shaken hands with each other or 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other is 3."
