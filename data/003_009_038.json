    "message_2": "Since we have a triangle with two adjacent angles measuring 45 degrees each, we know that the third angle must be 180 - 45 - 45 = 90 degrees. This means we have a right-angled triangle with one angle being 90 degrees and the other two angles being 45 degrees each.\n\nLet's denote the base of the triangle as b, and the two legs as a and c. In this case, b = 10 meters. Since the two legs are opposite to the 45-degree angles, they must be equal in length (a = c).\n\nWe can use the tangent function to find the length of the legs. The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle. In this case, we can use the tangent of one of the 45-degree angles:\n\ntan(45) = a / b\n\nSince tan(45) = 1, we have:\n\n1 = a / 10\n\nSolving for a, we get:\n\na = 10 meters\n\nSince a = c, we also have:\n\nc = 10 meters\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of all three sides:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + c = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is 30 meters."
