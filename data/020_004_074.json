    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, product A and product B. The profit generated for each unit of product A is $5 and for each unit of product B is $8. The company has a total of 200 units of raw materials available. It takes 2 units of raw materials to produce one unit of product A and 3 units of raw materials to produce one unit of product B. \nWhat is the maximum profit that the company can generate if it sells all the products it produces? Using quadratic programming, find the optimal number of units of product A and product B the company should produce to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The profit function to be maximized is:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 8y\n\nThe constraints for the problem are:\n\n1. Raw material constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 200 (since it takes 2 units of raw materials to produce one unit of product A and 3 units of raw materials to produce one unit of product B)\n2. Non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0\n\nWe can rewrite the raw material constraint as:\n\ny ≤ (200 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we can set up the quadratic programming problem:\n\nMaximize P(x, y) = 5x + 8y\nSubject to:\ny ≤ (200 - 2x) / 3\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the graphical method. First, we'll find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph.\n\n1. y = (200 - 2x) / 3 is a line with slope -2/3 and y-intercept 200/3. The feasible region is below this line.\n2. x ≥ 0 is a vertical line at x = 0. The feasible region is to the right of this line.\n3. y ≥ 0 is a horizontal line at y = 0. The feasible region is above this line.\n\nThe feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 200/3), and (100, 0). We can evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0\nP(0, 200/3) = 5(0) + 8(200/3) = 1600\nP(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (0, 200/3), where the company produces 0 units of product A and 200/3 ≈ 66.67 units of product B. However, since the company can only produce whole units of products, it should produce 66 units of product B and use the remaining 2 units of raw materials to produce 1 unit of product A.\n\nSo, the optimal number of units of product A and product B the company should produce is 1 unit of product A and 66 units of product B. The maximum profit the company can generate is:\n\nP(1, 66) = 5(1) + 8(66) = 5 + 528 = $533"
