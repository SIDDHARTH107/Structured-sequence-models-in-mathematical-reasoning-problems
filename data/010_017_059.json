    "message_2": "To sketch the level set of $f$ corresponding to the critical value $c=1$, we need to find all points $(x, y)$ such that $f(x, y) = 1$. In other words, we need to solve the equation:\n\n$$x^2 + y^2 = 1$$\n\nThis equation represents a circle centered at the origin with radius 1. So, the level set corresponding to the critical value $c=1$ is a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin.\n\nNow, let's find the critical points of $f$. The critical points are the points where the gradient of $f$ is zero. The gradient of $f$ is given by:\n\n$$\\nabla f = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right) = (2x, 2y)$$\n\nSetting the gradient to zero, we have:\n\n$$2x = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2y = 0$$\n\nThe only solution to this system of equations is $(x, y) = (0, 0)$. So, there is only one critical point, which is the origin.\n\nNow, we need to find the index of this critical point. The index is determined by the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of $f$. The Hessian matrix is given by:\n\n$$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are 2 and 2, both of which are positive. Therefore, the index of the critical point $(0, 0)$ is 0.\n\nUsing Morse inequalities, we can find the number of critical points of $f$ for each index. The Morse inequalities state that:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \\mu_k \\geq \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k b_k$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_k$ is the number of critical points of index $k$, $b_k$ is the $k$-th Betti number, and $n$ is the dimension of the manifold (in this case, $n=2$). The Betti numbers for $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are $b_0 = 1$ and $b_k = 0$ for $k > 0$. Therefore, the Morse inequalities become:\n\n$$\\mu_0 - \\mu_1 + \\mu_2 \\geq 1$$\n\nSince we have already found that $\\mu_0 = 1$, the inequality becomes:\n\n$$1 - \\mu_1 + \\mu_2 \\geq 1$$\n\nThis implies that $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$. Since the indices of critical points must be non-negative integers, the only possible solution is $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = 0$. So, there are no critical points of index 1 or 2.\n\nIn conclusion, there is one critical point of index 0 (the origin), and no critical points of index 1 or 2."
