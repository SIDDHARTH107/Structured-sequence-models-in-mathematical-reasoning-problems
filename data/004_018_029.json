    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^5, we will use the power rule. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1), where n is a constant.\n\nApplying the power rule to our function, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 5 * 3x^(5-1)\nf'(x) = 15x^4\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^5 is f'(x) = 15x^4."
