Determine whether the following statements are true or false in the given model:\n\n1. ◊p ∧ ◻r\n2. ¬◊r → (p ∨ q)\n3. ◻(p → r) ∨ ◊(p ∧ ¬r) \n\nSolve and provide the truth value for each statement in the given model.",
    "message_2": "1. ◊p ∧ ◻r\nSince p is true, ◊p (possibly p) is true. However, since r is unknown, we cannot say that ◻r (necessarily r) is true. Therefore, the statement ◊p ∧ ◻r is false.\n\n2. ¬◊r → (p ∨ q)\nSince r is unknown, ◊r (possibly r) is true. Therefore, ¬◊r (not possibly r) is false. In a material implication, if the antecedent (the part before the arrow) is false, the entire implication is true regardless of the consequent (the part after the arrow). So, ¬◊r → (p ∨ q) is true.\n\n3. ◻(p → r) ∨ ◊(p ∧ ¬r)\nFor the first part, ◻(p → r), since p is true and r is unknown, we cannot say that (p → r) is necessarily true. So, ◻(p → r) is false. For the second part, ◊(p ∧ ¬r), since p is true and r is unknown, (p ∧ ¬r) is possibly true. So, ◊(p ∧ ¬r) is true. Therefore, the statement ◻(p → r) ∨ ◊(p ∧ ¬r) is true because one part of the disjunction is true.\n\nIn summary:\n1. ◊p ∧ ◻r is false.\n2. ¬◊r → (p ∨ q) is true.\n3. ◻(p → r) ∨ ◊(p ∧ ¬r) is true."
