    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two products, A and B, with production costs of $50 and $80, respectively. The selling prices of the products are $100 for A and $120 for B. The company's objective is to maximize profit while producing at least 300 units of A and 200 units of B per month. How many units of A and B should the company produce to achieve this objective?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced.\n\nThe profit function can be represented as:\n\nProfit = (Selling price of A - Production cost of A) * x + (Selling price of B - Production cost of B) * y\nProfit = (100 - 50) * x + (120 - 80) * y\nProfit = 50x + 40y\n\nThe company wants to produce at least 300 units of A and 200 units of B, so we have the following constraints:\n\nx ≥ 300\ny ≥ 200\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy these constraints and result in the highest value of the profit function.\n\nSince the profit function is linear, the maximum profit will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region defined by the constraints. In this case, there are two vertices to consider: (300, 200) and any point where x > 300 and y > 200.\n\nLet's calculate the profit at the vertex (300, 200):\n\nProfit = 50(300) + 40(200) = 15000 + 8000 = 23000\n\nNow let's consider the case where x > 300 and y > 200. Since the profit function is increasing with both x and y, the profit will always be greater than 23000 in this region. Therefore, there is no maximum profit when both x and y are greater than their respective minimums.\n\nThus, the company should produce 300 units of product A and 200 units of product B to achieve a maximum profit of $23,000."
