    "message_2": "First, let's write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 6\n| 2  4  6 | 12\n| 3  6  9 | 18\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to obtain a row-echelon form.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 6\n| 0  0  0 | 0\n| 0  0  0 | 0\n\nWe can see that the second and third rows are all zeros. This means that the second and third equations do not provide any new information about the variables x, y, and z. We are left with only one independent equation:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 6\n\nSince we have only one independent equation and three variables, we cannot find a unique solution for this system. Instead, the system has infinitely many solutions, which can be expressed in terms of one or two free variables. For example, we can express the solution in terms of the free variables y and z:\n\nx = 6 - 2y - 3z\n\nSo, the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions."
