    "message_1": "Suppose there are three investment options: Stock A, Stock B, and Stock C. The expected returns on these investments are 7%, 9%, and 12% respectively. The standard deviations of their returns are 4%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. You have $100,000 to invest.\n\nUsing mathematical optimization techniques, what would be the optimal allocation of your investment among the three stocks to minimize risk while maximizing returns?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal allocation of the investment among the three stocks to minimize risk while maximizing returns, we can use the concept of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). MPT suggests that an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that will maximize returns for a given level of risk. The key to this is diversification, which means investing in assets that are not perfectly correlated.\n\nLet x, y, and z be the proportions of the investment in Stock A, Stock B, and Stock C, respectively. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y + z = 1 (The sum of the proportions should equal 1, as we are investing the entire amount)\n2. x, y, z >= 0 (The proportions cannot be negative)\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) can be calculated as follows:\n\nRp = 7%x + 9%y + 12%z\n\nThe risk of the portfolio can be measured by its variance (σ²). To calculate the variance, we need the correlation coefficients between the stocks (ρ_AB, ρ_BC, ρ_AC). Assuming we have these correlation coefficients, the variance of the portfolio can be calculated as follows:\n\nσ² = (4%x)² + (6%y)² + (8%z)² + 2(4%x)(6%y)ρ_AB + 2(6%y)(8%z)ρ_BC + 2(4%x)(8%z)ρ_AC\n\nOur goal is to maximize the expected return (Rp) while minimizing the risk (σ²). This can be done using optimization techniques such as the Efficient Frontier or Mean-Variance Optimization. However, these techniques require the correlation coefficients between the stocks, which are not provided in the problem.\n\nIf the correlation coefficients are provided, we can use optimization techniques to find the optimal values of x, y, and z that maximize the expected return while minimizing the risk. Once we have the optimal proportions, we can calculate the allocation of the $100,000 investment as follows:\n\nInvestment in Stock A = $100,000 * x\nInvestment in Stock B = $100,000 * y\nInvestment in Stock C = $100,000 * z"
