    "message_1": "A company needs to find the optimal production level for a certain product to maximize their profit. They have determined that their profit can be modeled by the function P(x) = 5x - x^2, where x represents the number of units produced. However, due to limited resources, the company cannot produce more than 10 units. \n\nWhat is the optimal production level for the company to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal production level to maximize profit, we need to find the maximum value of the profit function P(x) = 5x - x^2 within the constraint 0 ≤ x ≤ 10.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points of the function by taking the first derivative of P(x) and setting it equal to 0:\n\nP'(x) = d(5x - x^2)/dx = 5 - 2x\n\nNow, set P'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n5 - 2x = 0\n2x = 5\nx = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the constraint interval (x = 0 and x = 10) and the critical point (x = 2.5) to determine which one gives the maximum profit.\n\nP(0) = 5(0) - (0)^2 = 0\nP(2.5) = 5(2.5) - (2.5)^2 = 12.5 - 6.25 = 6.25\nP(10) = 5(10) - (10)^2 = 50 - 100 = -50\n\nComparing the profit values, we can see that the maximum profit occurs at x = 2.5 with a profit of 6.25. Therefore, the optimal production level for the company to maximize their profit is to produce 2.5 units. However, since the company cannot produce a fraction of a unit, they should produce either 2 or 3 units to achieve the maximum profit."
