    "message_2": "To find the degree of the rational curve parameterized by $(t^3-1, t^4-t)$ in the projective plane, we need to find the degree of the implicit equation that defines the curve.\n\nFirst, let's homogenize the parameterization by introducing a new variable $s$ and considering the curve in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$. The homogeneous parameterization is given by $(st^2(t^3-1), st^3(t^4-t)) = (st^2(t^3-1), st^3(t(t^3-1)))$.\n\nNow, let's eliminate the parameter $t$ by finding the resultant of the two polynomials with respect to $t$. Let $F = st^2(t^3-1)$ and $G = st^3(t(t^3-1))$. We have:\n\n$F = st^5 - st^2$\n$G = st^7 - st^4$\n\nNow, we compute the resultant of $F$ and $G$ with respect to $t$. The resultant is a polynomial in $s$ and the coefficients of $F$ and $G$:\n\n$R(F,G) = \\begin{vmatrix}\ns & 0 & -s & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & s & 0 & -s & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & s & 0 & -s \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & s & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & s \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}$\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\n$R(F,G) = s^5$\n\nSince the resultant is a non-zero polynomial, the implicit equation defining the curve is given by $R(F,G) = s^5 = 0$. The degree of this polynomial is 5, so the degree of the rational curve parameterized by $(t^3-1, t^4-t)$ in the projective plane is 5."
