    "message_2": "To determine the cohomology group H^3(X), we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT) for cohomology. The UCT states that there is a short exact sequence:\n\n0 → Ext(H^{n-1}(X), Z) → H^n(X) → Hom(H_n(X), Z) → 0\n\nwhere Ext and Hom are the Ext and Hom functors, respectively, and H_n(X) is the nth homology group of X.\n\nFirst, we need to find the homology groups H_n(X) for n = 2 and n = 3. Since we are given the cohomology groups H^0(X) = Z, H^1(X) = 0, and H^2(X) = Z/2Z, we can use the fact that for a finite CW complex, the homology and cohomology groups are isomorphic:\n\nH_0(X) = Z\nH_1(X) = 0\nH_2(X) = Z/2Z\n\nNow, we can apply the UCT for n = 3:\n\n0 → Ext(H^2(X), Z) → H^3(X) → Hom(H_3(X), Z) → 0\n\nWe need to compute Ext(H^2(X), Z) and Hom(H_3(X), Z). Since H^2(X) = Z/2Z, we have:\n\nExt(Z/2Z, Z) = Z/2Z\n\nNow, we don't know H_3(X) yet, but we can still write the UCT:\n\n0 → Z/2Z → H^3(X) → Hom(H_3(X), Z) → 0\n\nSince the sequence is exact, we know that the image of the map from Z/2Z to H^3(X) is isomorphic to the kernel of the map from H^3(X) to Hom(H_3(X), Z). This means that H^3(X) contains a Z/2Z summand.\n\nHowever, without more information about the topological space X or its homology groups, we cannot determine the full structure of H^3(X). It could be Z/2Z, or it could have additional summands."
