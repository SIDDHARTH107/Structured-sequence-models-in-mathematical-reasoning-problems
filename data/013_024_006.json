    "message_1": "In a volunteer organization, there are 10 volunteers who each must choose between either attending a fundraising event or staying home to relax. If less than 5 people attend the event, the event will not be successful and no funds will be raised. However, each volunteer only wants to attend the event if at least 4 others will also attend. If there is an even split among the volunteers in their decision to attend or stay home, what is the probability that the event will be successful?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the event will be successful, we need to determine the number of ways that at least 5 volunteers attend the event and divide that by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThere are 10 volunteers, so there are 2^10 = 1024 possible outcomes (each volunteer can either attend or stay home).\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways that at least 5 volunteers attend the event. We can use combinations for this:\n\n- 5 volunteers attend: C(10,5) = 10! / (5! * 5!) = 252\n- 6 volunteers attend: C(10,6) = 10! / (6! * 4!) = 210\n- 7 volunteers attend: C(10,7) = 10! / (7! * 3!) = 120\n- 8 volunteers attend: C(10,8) = 10! / (8! * 2!) = 45\n- 9 volunteers attend: C(10,9) = 10! / (9! * 1!) = 10\n- All 10 volunteers attend: C(10,10) = 10! / (10! * 0!) = 1\n\nNow, we add up these combinations to find the total number of successful outcomes:\n\n252 + 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = 638\n\nFinally, we divide the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes to find the probability:\n\nProbability = 638 / 1024 â‰ˆ 0.623\n\nSo, the probability that the event will be successful is approximately 62.3%."
