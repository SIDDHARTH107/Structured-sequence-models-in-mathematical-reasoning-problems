    "message_1": "What is the linking number of two different knots, A and B, in 4-dimensional Euclidean space?\n\nSuppose that knot A has 5 crossings, and its projection diagram can be represented as (3,1,-2,-4,-5). Knot B has a different projection diagram that can be represented as (1,2,-3,-5,-4). Find the linking number between these two knots.",
    "message_2": "In 4-dimensional Euclidean space, the linking number between two knots is not well-defined, as it is a concept that applies to knots in 3-dimensional space. The linking number is an integer that represents the number of times one knot winds around another knot in 3-dimensional space. In 4-dimensional space, knots can move freely without being linked or tangled, so the linking number concept does not apply."
