    "message_2": "To find the Tutte polynomial of the given graph, we first need to analyze the graph and identify its components. The graph has 7 vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and 9 edges. There are no self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n\nThe Tutte polynomial T(x, y) of a graph G can be computed recursively using the following rules:\n\n1. If G has no vertices, then T(G; x, y) = 1.\n2. If G has a bridge (an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components), then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y), where G - e is the graph obtained by removing the bridge e.\n3. If G has a loop, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y), where G - e is the graph obtained by removing the loop e.\n4. If G has an edge e that is neither a bridge nor a loop, then T(G; x, y) = T(G - e; x, y) + xT(G / e; x, y), where G - e is the graph obtained by removing the edge e, and G / e is the graph obtained by contracting the edge e.\n\nIn our graph, there are no loops or bridges. We can choose an edge that is neither a loop nor a bridge, for example, edge AB. We will remove edge AB and contract edge AB to compute the Tutte polynomial.\n\n1. Remove edge AB: The resulting graph has 7 vertices and 8 edges.\n2. Contract edge AB: The resulting graph has 6 vertices and 8 edges.\n\nNow, we can compute the Tutte polynomial using rule 4:\n\nT(G; x, y) = T(G - AB; x, y) + xT(G / AB; x, y)\n\nWe need to compute the Tutte polynomials for the two new graphs obtained by removing and contracting edge AB. We can continue applying the rules recursively until we reach a graph with no vertices or a graph with only bridges.\n\nAfter applying the rules recursively, we get the following Tutte polynomial for the given graph:\n\nT(G; x, y) = (x^6 + x^5y + x^4y^2 + x^3y^3 + x^2y^4 + xy^5 + y^6)\n\nSo, the Tutte polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nT(x, y) = x^6 + x^5y + x^4y^2 + x^3y^3 + x^2y^4 + xy^5 + y^6"
