    "message_1": "Let $X$ be a closed, orientable 2-manifold with genus $g$ and $n$ boundaries. Let $Y$ be a closed subset of $X$ consisting of $k$ oriented loops. \n\nWhat is the rank of the $H_1(X, Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ group?",
    "message_2": "To compute the rank of the relative homology group $H_1(X, Y; \\mathbb{Z})$, we can use the long exact sequence of the pair $(X, Y)$:\n\n$$\\cdots \\rightarrow H_1(Y; \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H_1(X, Y; \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H_0(Y; \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H_0(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow \\cdots$$\n\nSince $X$ is a closed, orientable 2-manifold with genus $g$ and $n$ boundaries, its first homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ has rank $2g + n - 1$. This is because a closed, orientable surface of genus $g$ has $2g$ independent cycles, and each boundary component contributes an additional independent cycle, except for one which is linearly dependent on the others.\n\nNow, let's consider the homology groups of $Y$. Since $Y$ consists of $k$ oriented loops, its zeroth homology group $H_0(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ has rank $k$, as each loop contributes a connected component. The first homology group $H_1(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ has rank $k$ as well, since each loop is an independent cycle.\n\nApplying the rank-nullity theorem to the portion of the long exact sequence involving $H_1(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$, $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, and $H_1(X, Y; \\mathbb{Z})$, we get:\n\n$$\\operatorname{rank}(H_1(Y; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\operatorname{rank}(H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})) - \\operatorname{rank}(H_1(X, Y; \\mathbb{Z})) + \\operatorname{null}(H_1(X, Y; \\mathbb{Z}))$$\n\nSince the map $H_1(X, Y; \\mathbb{Z}) \\rightarrow H_0(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ is surjective, we have $\\operatorname{null}(H_1(X, Y; \\mathbb{Z})) = k$. Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$k = (2g + n - 1) - \\operatorname{rank}(H_1(X, Y; \\mathbb{Z})) + k$$\n\nSolving for the rank of the relative homology group, we get:\n\n$$\\operatorname{rank}(H_1(X, Y; \\mathbb{Z})) = 2g + n - 1$$"
