    "message_2": "To determine the degree of X, we can compute the degree of the projective variety by taking the product of the degrees of the generators of the ideal I and then dividing by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The degrees of the generators are:\n\ndeg(x^3 - yz) = 3\ndeg(xz - y^2) = 2\ndeg(y^3 - xw) = 3\n\nThe GCD of these degrees is 1. Therefore, the degree of X is:\n\ndegree(X) = (3 * 2 * 3) / 1 = 18\n\nNow, to find the number of singular points, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the generators with respect to the variables x, y, z, and w, and then find the common zeros of these partial derivatives.\n\n∂(x^3 - yz) / ∂x = 3x^2\n∂(x^3 - yz) / ∂y = -z\n∂(x^3 - yz) / ∂z = -y\n\n∂(xz - y^2) / ∂x = z\n∂(xz - y^2) / ∂y = -2y\n∂(xz - y^2) / ∂z = x\n\n∂(y^3 - xw) / ∂x = -w\n∂(y^3 - xw) / ∂y = 3y^2\n∂(y^3 - xw) / ∂w = -x\n\nNow, we need to find the common zeros of these partial derivatives:\n\n3x^2 = -z = -y = z = -2y = x = -w = 3y^2 = -x\n\nFrom the equations 3x^2 = -y and 3y^2 = -x, we get x = -y^2 and y = -x^2. Substituting x = -y^2 into y = -x^2, we get y = -(-y^2)^2 = -y^4. Thus, y^4 + y = 0. Since k is an algebraically closed field, this polynomial equation has exactly 4 roots in k, counting multiplicities.\n\nFor each root of y, we can find the corresponding value of x. Therefore, there are 4 singular points on the projective variety X."
