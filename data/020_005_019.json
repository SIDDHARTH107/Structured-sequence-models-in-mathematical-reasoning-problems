    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA factory produces two products, X and Y. The profit per unit of product X is $5 and the profit per unit of product Y is $8. The factory has 200 units of material A and 250 units of material B available for production. Product X requires 2 units of material A and 5 units of material B to produce, while product Y requires 4 units of material A and 3 units of material B to produce. The factory can produce up to 40 units of product X and up to 30 units of product Y. Formulate an integer programming model to maximize the total profit of the factory and solve it. What is the maximum profit that the factory can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product X produced and y be the number of units of product Y produced. We want to maximize the total profit, which is given by the objective function:\n\nP = 5x + 8y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 200 (Material A constraint)\n5x + 3y ≤ 250 (Material B constraint)\nx ≤ 40 (Product X production limit)\ny ≤ 30 (Product Y production limit)\nx, y ≥ 0 (Non-negativity constraint)\n\nThis is an integer programming problem since x and y must be integers (whole number of products). To solve this problem, we can use the graphical method to find the feasible region and then check the integer points within that region to find the maximum profit.\n\n1. Graph the constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 200 => y ≤ 50 - 0.5x\n5x + 3y ≤ 250 => y ≤ (250 - 5x)/3\nx ≤ 40\ny ≤ 30\n\n2. Find the feasible region:\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all the constraints are satisfied. In this case, it is a polygon with vertices at points (0, 0), (0, 30), (20, 30), (40, 20), and (40, 0).\n\n3. Check the integer points within the feasible region:\n\nWe can now check the integer points within the feasible region to find the maximum profit. The points with the highest profit are (20, 30) and (40, 20), both yielding a profit of P = 5(20) + 8(30) = 100 + 240 = $340.\n\nTherefore, the maximum profit that the factory can make is $340."
