    "message_2": "To prove that the union of sets A and B contains each element in A and B, we need to show that for every element x in A or B, x is also in the union of A and B.\n\nLet A = {1, 3, 5, 7} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8}. The union of A and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in A or in B or in both.\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n\nNow, let's take an element x from set A. We can see that x is also in A ∪ B:\n\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ A and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n7 ∈ A and 7 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSimilarly, let's take an element x from set B. We can see that x is also in A ∪ B:\n\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n8 ∈ B and 8 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element in A and B is also in A ∪ B, we have proved that the union of sets A and B contains each element in A and B."
