    "message_1": "In a market, there are 200 potential customers. Sales data indicates that historically 40% of the customers are willing to purchase a high-end product. What is the probability that in a given day, at least 60 customers will buy a high-end product?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 60 customers will buy a high-end product, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X ≥ k) = 1 - P(X < k)\n\nwhere X is the number of customers who buy a high-end product, k is the number of customers we want to find the probability for (in this case, 60), and P(X < k) is the cumulative probability of X being less than k.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, n is the total number of customers (200), k is the number of customers who buy a high-end product, p is the probability of a customer buying a high-end product (0.4), and (1-p) is the probability of a customer not buying a high-end product (0.6).\n\nTo find P(X < 60), we need to calculate the sum of the probabilities for X = 0, 1, 2, ..., 59. Then, we can use the formula P(X ≥ 60) = 1 - P(X < 60) to find the probability of at least 60 customers buying a high-end product.\n\nCalculating the sum of probabilities for X = 0 to 59 can be computationally intensive, so we can use a normal approximation to the binomial distribution to simplify the calculation. The normal approximation uses the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution:\n\nμ = n * p = 200 * 0.4 = 80\nσ = sqrt(n * p * (1-p)) = sqrt(200 * 0.4 * 0.6) ≈ 6.93\n\nNow, we can standardize the value k (60) using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (k - μ) / σ = (60 - 80) / 6.93 ≈ -2.89\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the cumulative probability for z = -2.89, which is P(Z < -2.89) ≈ 0.0019.\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of at least 60 customers buying a high-end product:\n\nP(X ≥ 60) = 1 - P(X < 60) = 1 - 0.0019 = 0.9981\n\nSo, the probability that at least 60 customers will buy a high-end product in a given day is approximately 99.81%."
