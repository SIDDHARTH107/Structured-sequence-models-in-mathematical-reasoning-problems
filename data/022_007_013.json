    "message_2": "To prove that f(z) is constant, we will use Liouville's theorem, which states that a bounded entire function (i.e., a function that is analytic throughout the complex plane) must be constant.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic throughout the complex plane and satisfies |f(z)| ≤ 2 for all z, it is a bounded entire function. By Liouville's theorem, f(z) must be constant.\n\nThus, there is no non-constant function f(z) that is analytic throughout the complex plane and satisfies |f(z)| ≤ 2 for all z."
