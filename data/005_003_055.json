They have collected data for 15 products, and the data is given below: \n\nCost of production (in thousands of dollars): 4.2, 3.9, 5.1, 4.3, 3.7, 4.8, 5.6, 3.5, 6.9, 5.2, 5.7, 6.3, 7.1, 6.5, 5.9\n\nSelling price (in thousands of dollars): 6.5, 5.8, 7.2, 6.6, 5.2, 7.0, 7.6, 5.0, 9.8, 7.3, 8.0, 8.5, 9.2, 8.6, 7.8\n\nUsing regression analysis, find the equation of the line that best describes the relationship between the cost of production and the selling price. Use the equation to predict the selling price if the cost of production is 4.5 thousand dollars.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the line that best describes the relationship between the cost of production and the selling price, we will use the least squares method for linear regression. The equation of the line will be in the form y = mx + b, where y is the selling price, x is the cost of production, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mean of the cost of production (x) and the mean of the selling price (y).\n\nMean of cost of production (x̄) = (4.2 + 3.9 + 5.1 + 4.3 + 3.7 + 4.8 + 5.6 + 3.5 + 6.9 + 5.2 + 5.7 + 6.3 + 7.1 + 6.5 + 5.9) / 15 = 75.8 / 15 = 5.053\n\nMean of selling price (ȳ) = (6.5 + 5.8 + 7.2 + 6.6 + 5.2 + 7.0 + 7.6 + 5.0 + 9.8 + 7.3 + 8.0 + 8.5 + 9.2 + 8.6 + 7.8) / 15 = 110.1 / 15 = 7.34\n\nNext, we need to calculate the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b).\n\nm = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nb = ȳ - m * x̄\n\nCalculating the values for m and b:\n\nm = (Σ[(xi - 5.053)(yi - 7.34)]) / Σ(xi - 5.053)^2\n\nm = ([(4.2-5.053)(6.5-7.34) + (3.9-5.053)(5.8-7.34) + ... + (6.5-5.053)(8.6-7.34) + (5.9-5.053)(7.8-7.34)]) / [(4.2-5.053)^2 + (3.9-5.053)^2 + ... + (6.5-5.053)^2 + (5.9-5.053)^2]\n\nm ≈ 1.633\n\nNow, we can calculate the y-intercept (b):\n\nb = 7.34 - 1.633 * 5.053\n\nb ≈ 0.871\n\nSo, the equation of the line is:\n\ny = 1.633x + 0.871\n\nNow, we can use the equation to predict the selling price if the cost of production is 4.5 thousand dollars:\n\ny = 1.633 * 4.5 + 0.871\n\ny ≈ 8.19\n\nTherefore, the predicted selling price for a product with a cost of production of 4.5 thousand dollars is approximately 8.19 thousand dollars."
