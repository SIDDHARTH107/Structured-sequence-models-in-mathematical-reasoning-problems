    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, using three machines. The time required to produce each unit of product A on machines 1, 2, and 3 is 1, 2, and 3 hours, respectively. The time required to produce each unit of product B on machines 1, 2, and 3 is 2, 1, and 2 hours, respectively. There are 300 hours available on each machine for production. Product A earns a profit of $10 per unit and product B earns a profit of $15 per unit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit, given that they have a total of 450 hours available for production?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are given by the time required to produce each unit of product A and B on machines 1, 2, and 3, and the total hours available for production.\n\nMachine 1:\n1x + 2y ≤ 300 (1)\n\nMachine 2:\n2x + 1y ≤ 300 (2)\n\nMachine 3:\n3x + 2y ≤ 300 (3)\n\nTotal hours available for production:\nx + y ≤ 450 (4)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is given by:\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nWe will solve the system of inequalities to find the feasible region and then use the corner point method to find the optimal solution.\n\nFirst, we will find the corner points of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of (1) and (2):\n1x + 2y = 300\n2x + 1y = 300\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get x = 100 and y = 100.\n\n2.
