The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. \n\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {2, 3, 4} (intersection of A and B)\n\nNow, subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nA △ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} - {2, 3, 4} = {1, 5}\n\nNow, we need to find the union of (A △ B) and B:\n\n(A △ B) ∪ B = {1, 5} ∪ {2, 3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSo, (A △ B) ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}."
