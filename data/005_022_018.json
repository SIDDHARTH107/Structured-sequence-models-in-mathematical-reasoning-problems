    "message_2": "To find the median salary, we first need to arrange the salaries in ascending order:\n\n$32,000, $35,000, $36,000, $38,000, $41,000, $42,000, $43,000, $45,000, $50,000, $55,000.\n\nSince there are 10 employees (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values (5th and 6th values):\n\nMedian = ($41,000 + $42,000) / 2 = $83,000 / 2 = $41,500.\n\nTo find the interquartile range (IQR), we need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) and then subtract Q1 from Q3.\n\nQ1 is the median of the lower half of the data (excluding the median if the number of data points is odd). In this case, the lower half of the data is:\n\n$32,000, $35,000, $36,000, $38,000, $41,000.\n\nSince there are 5 values (an odd number), the first quartile (Q1) is the middle value, which is $36,000.\n\nQ3 is the median of the upper half of the data (excluding the median if the number of data points is odd). In this case, the upper half of the data is:\n\n$42,000, $43,000, $45,000, $50,000, $55,000.\n\nSince there are 5 values (an odd number), the third quartile (Q3) is the middle value, which is $45,000.\n\nNow, we can find the interquartile range (IQR) by subtracting Q1 from Q3:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1 = $45,000 - $36,000 = $9,000.\n\nSo, the median salary of the employees is $41,500, and the interquartile range of the salaries is $9,000."
