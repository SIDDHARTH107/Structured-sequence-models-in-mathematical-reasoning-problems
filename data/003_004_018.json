    "message_2": "To solve the trigonometric equation 2 cos(3x) - 1 = 0 for values of x between 0 and 2π radians, follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate the cosine function:\n2 cos(3x) - 1 = 0\n2 cos(3x) = 1\ncos(3x) = 1/2\n\n2. Find the angles for which the cosine function equals 1/2:\ncos(3x) = cos(π/3) and cos(3x) = cos(5π/3)\n\n3. Set up the general solution for the cosine function:\n3x = π/3 + 2πk or 3x = 5π/3 + 2πk, where k is an integer\n\n4. Solve for x:\nx = (π/3) / 3 + (2πk) / 3 or x = (5π/3) / 3 + (2πk) / 3\nx = π/9 + 2πk/3 or x = 5π/9 + 2πk/3\n\n5. Find the values of x between 0 and 2π radians:\nFor k = 0:\nx = π/9 or x = 5π/9\n\nFor k = 1:\nx = π/9 + 2π/3 = π/9 + 6π/9 = 7π/9\nx = 5π/9 + 2π/3 = 5π/9 + 6π/9 = 11π/9\n\nFor k = 2:\nx = π/9 + 4π/3 = π/9 + 12π/9 = 13π/9 (This value is greater than 2π, so we stop here.)\n\nSo, the solutions for x between 0 and 2π radians are:\nx = π/9, 5π/9, 7π/9, and 11π/9."
