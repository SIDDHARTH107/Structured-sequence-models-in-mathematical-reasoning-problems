    "message_2": "To solve the Diophantine equation 4x + 7y = 123, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the general solution.\n\nFirst, we find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 4 and 7 using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n7 = 1 * 4 + 3\n4 = 1 * 3 + 1\n3 = 3 * 1\n\nSo, gcd(4, 7) = 1.\n\nNow, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers s and t such that:\n\n4s + 7t = gcd(4, 7) = 1\n\nWorking backwards through the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1 = 4 - 1 * 3\n1 = 4 - 1 * (7 - 1 * 4)\n1 = 2 * 4 - 1 * 7\n\nSo, s = 2 and t = -1.\n\nNow, we can find the general solution to the Diophantine equation:\n\n4x + 7y = 123\n\nMultiply both sides of the equation 4s + 7t = 1 by 123:\n\n4(2) * 123 + 7(-1) * 123 = 123\n\nThis gives:\n\n984x - 861y = 123\n\nNow, we can find a particular solution by setting x = x0 and y = y0:\n\nx0 = 2 * 123 = 246\ny0 = -1 * 123 = -123\n\nSo, one particular solution is (x0, y0) = (246, -123).\n\nNow, we can find the general solution by adding integer multiples of the coefficients of the original equation:\n\nx = x0 + 7n = 246 + 7n\ny = y0 - 4n = -123 - 4n\n\nwhere n is an integer.\n\nSo, the general solution to the Diophantine equation 4x + 7y = 123 is given by:\n\nx = 246 + 7n\ny = -123 - 4n\n\nwhere n is an integer."
