    "message_2": "The chromatic polynomial of a graph is a polynomial that counts the number of proper colorings of the graph using k colors. In this case, the graph is a simple square with 4 vertices (A, B, C, and D) and 4 edges.\n\nTo find the chromatic polynomial, we can use the deletion-contraction method. Let P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial of the graph G with k colors. We can choose an edge, say the edge connecting A and B. Then, we can delete this edge and contract it.\n\n1. Deleting the edge AB, we get a graph with 4 vertices and 3 edges:\n\n```\nA     B\n|     |\nC --- D\n```\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of this graph is P(G - AB, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n\n2. Contracting the edge AB, we get a graph with 3 vertices and 3 edges:\n\n```\nA-B\n|  \\\nC---D\n```\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of this graph is P(G/AB, k) = k(k-1)^2.\n\nNow, we can use the deletion-contraction formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - AB, k) - P(G/AB, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) - k(k-1)^2.\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) - k(k-1)^2."
