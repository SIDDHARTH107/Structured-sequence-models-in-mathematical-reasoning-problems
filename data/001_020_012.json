    "message_2": "For a graph to intersect the x-axis, the y-value must be equal to 0. So, we need to find the x-values when y = 0 in the equation y = |3x - 4|.\n\n0 = |3x - 4|\n\nThere are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: The expression inside the absolute value is positive or zero.\n3x - 4 ≥ 0\n3x ≥ 4\nx ≥ 4/3\n\nIn this case, the equation becomes:\n0 = 3x - 4\n\nSolving for x:\n3x = 4\nx = 4/3\n\nCase 2: The expression inside the absolute value is negative.\n3x - 4 < 0\n3x < 4\nx < 4/3\n\nIn this case, the equation becomes:\n0 = -(3x - 4)\n\nSolving for x:\n3x = 4\nx = 4/3\n\nIn both cases, we get the same x-value, x = 4/3. Therefore, the graph of the absolute value equation y = |3x - 4| intersects the x-axis at x = 4/3."
