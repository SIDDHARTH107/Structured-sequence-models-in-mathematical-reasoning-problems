    "message_2": "Since Y is a path-connected subspace of X, it means that for any two points in Y, there exists a continuous path between them within Y. This property implies that Y is also connected.\n\nNow, let's consider the connected components of X. Since X has exactly 3 connected components, we can denote them as A, B, and C. Since Y has at least 2 points and is path-connected, it must be entirely contained within one of these connected components, say A.\n\nTherefore, Y is a connected subspace of A, and since A is connected, Y cannot be divided into more connected components. Thus, the minimum number of connected components that Y can have is 1."
