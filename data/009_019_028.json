If the particle starts at position $X_0 = 1$, find the probability that the particle will cross the point $X = 4$ in the time interval $[0, 1]$.",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the particle will cross the point $X = 4$ in the time interval $[0, 1]$, we first need to find the solution to the given stochastic differential equation (SDE). We can rewrite the SDE as:\n\n$dX_t = 2X_t dt + 3dW_t$\n\nApplying Ito's lemma, we can find the solution to this SDE. Let $Y_t = \\ln(X_t)$. Then, by Ito's lemma, we have:\n\n$dY_t = \\frac{1}{X_t} dX_t - \\frac{1}{2X_t^2} (3^2) dt$\n\nSubstituting the given SDE into this equation, we get:\n\n$dY_t = \\frac{1}{X_t} (2X_t dt + 3dW_t) - \\frac{9}{2X_t^2} dt$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$dY_t = 2 dt + 3 dW_t - \\frac{9}{2} dt$\n\n$dY_t = (2 - \\frac{9}{2}) dt + 3 dW_t$\n\n$dY_t = -\\frac{5}{2} dt + 3 dW_t$\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides from 0 to t:\n\n$Y_t - Y_0 = -\\frac{5}{2} \\int_0^t ds + 3 \\int_0^t dW_s$\n\nSince $X_0 = 1$, we have $Y_0 = \\ln(1) = 0$. Therefore,\n\n$Y_t = -\\frac{5}{2} t + 3 W_t$\n\nNow, we can find $X_t$ by exponentiating both sides:\n\n$X_t = e^{Y_t} = e^{-\\frac{5}{2} t + 3 W_t}$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that $X_t$ crosses 4 in the interval $[0, 1]$. Let $T = \\inf\\{t \\in [0, 1]: X_t = 4\\}$. We want to find $P(T \\le 1)$. \n\nUsing the fact that $X_t = e^{-\\frac{5}{2} t + 3 W_t}$, we have:\n\n$4 = e^{-\\frac{5}{2} T + 3 W_T}$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n$\\ln(4) = -\\frac{5}{2} T + 3 W_T$\n\nRearranging the terms:\n\n$W_T = \\frac{1}{3} (\\ln(4) + \\frac{5}{2} T)$\n\nSince $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, $W_T$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance T. Therefore, we have:\n\n$Z = \\frac{W_T}{\\sqrt{T}} \\sim N(0, 1)$\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation for $W_T$ in terms of Z:\n\n$Z = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{T}} (\\ln(4) + \\frac{5}{2} T)$\n\nNow, we want to find the probability $P(T \\le 1)$. This can be expressed as:\n\n$P(T \\le 1) = P\\left(Z \\le \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{T}} (\\ln(4) + \\frac{5}{2} T)\\right)$\n\nUnfortunately, this probability does not have a closed-form expression, and it must be evaluated numerically. You can use numerical methods or simulation techniques to approximate the probability that the particle will cross the point $X = 4$ in the time interval $[0, 1]$."
