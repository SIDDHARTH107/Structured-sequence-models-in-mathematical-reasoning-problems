    "message_2": "The number of different 5x5 Latin squares can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nNumber of Latin squares = (5!)^(5-1) / 5!\n\nHere, 5! represents the factorial of 5, which is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.\n\nNow, let's plug the numbers into the formula:\n\nNumber of Latin squares = (120)^(5-1) / 120\nNumber of Latin squares = (120)^4 / 120\nNumber of Latin squares = 207,360,000 / 120\nNumber of Latin squares = 1,728,000\n\nSo, there are 1,728,000 different 5x5 Latin squares possible."
