    "message_2": "To find the poles of the meromorphic function f(z) = (z^3 + 2z^2)/(z^2 - 1), we first need to find the zeros of the denominator, since a pole occurs when the denominator of a rational function is zero.\n\nThe denominator is z^2 - 1, which can be factored as (z - 1)(z + 1). So, the zeros of the denominator are z = 1 and z = -1. These are the potential poles of the function.\n\nNow, we need to find the order of each pole. The order of a pole is the number of times it appears as a zero in the denominator, taking into account the numerator. \n\nFor z = 1, we can use the limit definition of the order of a pole:\n\nlim (z -> 1) [(z - 1) * f(z)] = lim (z -> 1) [(z - 1) * (z^3 + 2z^2) / (z^2 - 1)].\n\nWe can cancel out the (z - 1) term in the numerator and denominator:\n\nlim (z -> 1) [(z^3 + 2z^2) / (z + 1)].\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit:\n\nlim (z -> 1) [(1^3 + 2 * 1^2) / (1 + 1)] = (1 + 2) / 2 = 3/2.\n\nSince the limit is finite and nonzero, the order of the pole at z = 1 is 1.\n\nFor z = -1, we can use the same method:\n\nlim (z -> -1) [(z + 1) * f(z)] = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1) * (z^3 + 2z^2) / (z^2 - 1)].\n\nWe can cancel out the (z + 1) term in the numerator and denominator:\n\nlim (z -> -1) [(z^3 + 2z^2) / (z - 1)].\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit:\n\nlim (z -> -1) [((-1)^3 + 2 * (-1)^2) / (-1 - 1)] = (-1 + 2) / (-2) = 1/2.\n\nSince the limit is finite and nonzero, the order of the pole at z = -1 is 1.\n\nSo, the function f(z) has two poles: z = 1 with order 1 and z = -1 with order 1."
