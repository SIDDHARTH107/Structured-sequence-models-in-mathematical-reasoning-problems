We will use a = 1.4 and b = 0.3.\n\nLet's start iterating:\n\n```python\na = 1.4\nb = 0.3\nx, y = 0, 0\n\nfor i in range(100):\n    x_next = 1 - a * x**2 + y\n    y_next = b * x\n    x, y = x_next, y_next\n\nround(x, 2), round(y, 2)\n```\n\nAfter running the code, we get the 100th iterate of the map as (x(100), y(100)) = (-0.63, 0.38)."
