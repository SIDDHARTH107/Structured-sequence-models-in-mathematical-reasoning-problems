If a mass of 2 kg is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 10 N/m and given an initial displacement of 0.1 m from its equilibrium position, find the equation of motion and the period of oscillation of the mass.",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion, we first need to solve the given differential equation:\n\nm(d^2x)/(dt^2) + kx = 0\n\nGiven that m = 2 kg and k = 10 N/m, the equation becomes:\n\n2(d^2x)/(dt^2) + 10x = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n(d^2x)/(dt^2) + 5x = 0\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution for this type of equation is:\n\nx(t) = A*cos(ωt) + B*sin(ωt)\n\nwhere A and B are constants, ω is the angular frequency, and t is time. To find ω, we can use the relation:\n\nω^2 = k/m\n\nSubstituting the given values of k and m:\n\nω^2 = 10/2 = 5\n\nω = sqrt(5) rad/s\n\nNow, we need to find the constants A and B. We are given the initial displacement x(0) = 0.1 m. Substituting this into the general solution:\n\n0.1 = A*cos(0) + B*sin(0)\n\n0.1 = A\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, B does not affect the initial displacement. Therefore, the equation of motion is:\n\nx(t) = 0.1*cos(sqrt(5)*t) + B*sin(sqrt(5)*t)\n\nTo find the period of oscillation, we can use the relation:\n\nT = 2π/ω\n\nSubstituting the value of ω:\n\nT = 2π/sqrt(5)\n\nT ≈ 2.82 s\n\nSo, the equation of motion is x(t) = 0.1*cos(sqrt(5)*t) + B*sin(sqrt(5)*t), and the period of oscillation is approximately 2.82 seconds."
