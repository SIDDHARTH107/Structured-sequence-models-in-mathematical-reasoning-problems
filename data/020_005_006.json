    "message_1": "A company needs to determine how many units of Product A and Product B to produce in order to maximize their profit. Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of labor and $5 worth of materials, while each unit of Product B requires 3 hours of labor and $6 worth of materials.\n\nIn addition, the company has a total of 120 hours of labor and $240 available for materials. For each unit of Product A sold, the company makes a profit of $10, and for each unit of Product B sold, the company makes a profit of $15.\n\nWhat is the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B the company should produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor and materials can be written as:\n2x + 3y ≤ 120 (labor constraint)\n5x + 6y ≤ 240 (material constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize profit is:\nP = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 120\ny ≤ (120 - 2x) / 3\n\n5x + 6y ≤ 240\ny ≤ (240 - 5x) / 6\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 40), (24, 32), and (48, 0). We will evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices to find the maximum profit:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 10(0) + 15(0) = $0\n2. P(0, 40) = 10(0) + 15(40) = $600\n3. P(24, 32) = 10(24) + 15(32) = $720\n4. P(48, 0) = 10(48) + 15(0) = $480\n\nThe maximum profit of $720 is achieved when the company produces 24 units of Product A and 32 units of Product B."
