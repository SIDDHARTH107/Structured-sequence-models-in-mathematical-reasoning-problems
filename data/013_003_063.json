    "message_1": "In an ultimatum game, Player 1 is given $100 and must offer a portion of it to Player 2. If Player 2 accepts the offer, they each keep their share. If Player 2 rejects the offer, neither player receives any money. If Player 2 has a minimum acceptable offer of $20, what is the highest offer that Player 1 can make to guarantee that Player 2 accepts the offer?",
    "message_2": "Since Player 2 has a minimum acceptable offer of $20, Player 1 can make an offer of $20 to guarantee that Player 2 accepts the offer. This is the highest offer that Player 1 can make to ensure acceptance, as offering any less would risk rejection by Player 2."
