Use the Fourier transform to analyze the stability of this system. Find the solution when the initial displacement is y(0) = 3 and the initial velocity is y'(0) = -2.",
    "message_2": "To analyze the stability of the given linear system, we first need to find the characteristic equation of the given differential equation:\n\ny''(t) + 4y(t) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 + 4 = 0\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = Â±2i\n\nSince the roots are purely imaginary, the system is stable.\n\nNow, let's find the solution to the given initial value problem. Since the roots are complex, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is of the form:\n\ny(t) = C1 * cos(2t) + C2 * sin(2t)\n\nWe are given the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = 3\ny'(0) = -2\n\nApplying the initial conditions:\n\ny(0) = C1 * cos(0) + C2 * sin(0) = 3\nC1 = 3\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative of y(t):\n\ny'(t) = -3 * 2 * sin(2t) + C2 * 2 * cos(2t)\n\nApplying the second initial condition:\n\ny'(0) = -3 * 2 * sin(0) + C2 * 2 * cos(0) = -2\nC2 = -1\n\nSo, the solution to the given initial value problem is:\n\ny(t) = 3 * cos(2t) - sin(2t)"
