    "message_1": "In the design of a survey, a researcher wants to ensure that each of the 6 questions is asked to each of the 10 participants. How many different ways can the survey be constructed to ensure this requirement is met?",
    "message_2": "If each of the 6 questions is asked to each of the 10 participants, then each participant will answer all 6 questions. The order in which the questions are asked to each participant can vary. \n\nFor the first participant, there are 6 questions that can be asked first, then 5 remaining questions that can be asked second, 4 remaining questions that can be asked third, and so on. So, for the first participant, there are 6! (6 factorial) ways to ask the questions.\n\nSimilarly, for each of the other 9 participants, there are also 6! ways to ask the questions.\n\nSince there are 10 participants, the total number of ways to construct the survey is:\n\n(6!)^10 = (720)^10 ≈ 2.601 × 10^27 different ways."
