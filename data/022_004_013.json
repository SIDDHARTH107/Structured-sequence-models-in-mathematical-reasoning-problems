    "message_2": "To calculate the residue of the function f(z) = (z^3 + 2z + 1)/(z^2 - 3z + 2) at the singularity z = 1, we first need to find the singularities of the function. The singularities occur when the denominator is equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 3z + 2 = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n(z - 1)(z - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the singularities are z = 1 and z = 2. Since we are interested in the singularity at z = 1, we can rewrite the function as:\n\nf(z) = (z^3 + 2z + 1)/((z - 1)(z - 2))\n\nNow, we need to find the residue at z = 1. Since the denominator has a simple pole at z = 1, we can use the formula for the residue:\n\nRes[f(z), z = 1] = lim(z -> 1) [(z - 1) * f(z)]\n\n= lim(z -> 1) [(z - 1) * (z^3 + 2z + 1)/((z - 1)(z - 2))]\n\nCancelling out the (z - 1) term in the numerator and denominator, we get:\n\n= lim(z -> 1) [(z^3 + 2z + 1)/(z - 2)]\n\nNow, we can substitute z = 1 into the expression:\n\n= (1^3 + 2*1 + 1)/(1 - 2)\n\n= (1 + 2 + 1)/(-1)\n\n= 4/(-1)\n\n= -4\n\nSo, the residue of the function f(z) = (z^3 + 2z + 1)/(z^2 - 3z + 2) at the singularity z = 1 is -4."
