    "message_2": "The logistic map equation is given by:\n\nx_n+1 = r * x_n * (1 - x_n)\n\nwhere x_n is the population density at time step n, r is the growth rate parameter, and x_n+1 is the population density at the next time step.\n\nTo find the steady-state population, we need to iterate the equation until the population density converges to a stable value. Let's perform the iterations for r = 3.6 and an initial population density x_0 = 0.2.\n\nIteration 1:\nx_1 = 3.6 * 0.2 * (1 - 0.2) = 0.576\n\nIteration 2:\nx_2 = 3.6 * 0.576 * (1 - 0.576) ≈ 0.883\n\nIteration 3:\nx_3 = 3.6 * 0.883 * (1 - 0.883) ≈ 0.364\n\nIteration 4:\nx_4 = 3.6 * 0.364 * (1 - 0.364) ≈ 0.832\n\n...\n\nAfter several iterations, the population density will oscillate between a few values without converging to a single steady-state value. This is because, for r = 3.6, the logistic map exhibits chaotic behavior, meaning that the population density does not converge to a single steady-state value but instead oscillates between multiple values.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no single steady-state population density for the logistic map equation with r = 3.6 and an initial population density of 0.2 due to its chaotic behavior."
