    "message_1": "A math student wanted to analyze the test scores of their class. They recorded the scores of 20 students and found the average score to be 75 with a standard deviation of 10. What percentage of students scored above 90?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the properties of a normal distribution. We know that the average score is 75 and the standard deviation is 10. We want to find the percentage of students who scored above 90.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-score for a score of 90. The z-score is calculated as:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFor a score of 90:\n\nz = (90 - 75) / 10\nz = 15 / 10\nz = 1.5\n\nNow, we need to find the area to the right of the z-score 1.5 in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator with a built-in z-score function. The area to the right of z = 1.5 is approximately 0.0668 or 6.68%.\n\nSo, approximately 6.68% of students scored above 90."
