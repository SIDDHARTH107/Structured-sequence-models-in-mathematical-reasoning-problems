    "message_1": "In an equilateral triangle, each side measures 12 cm. What is the length of one of its altitude?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the altitude in an equilateral triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Let's call the altitude h, and since the triangle is equilateral, the base of the triangle can be divided into two equal parts, each measuring half of the side length (12 cm / 2 = 6 cm).\n\nNow we have a right triangle with one leg measuring 6 cm and the other leg being the altitude (h). The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the side of the equilateral triangle, which is 12 cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), where a and b are the legs and c is the hypotenuse, we can write the equation:\n\n6^2 + h^2 = 12^2\n36 + h^2 = 144\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh^2 = 144 - 36\nh^2 = 108\nh = √108\n\nTo simplify the square root, we can find the prime factors of 108:\n\n108 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 2^2 * 3^3\n\nNow, we can take out any pair of equal factors:\n\nh = √(2^2 * 3^3) = 2 * 3 * √3 = 6√3\n\nSo, the length of the altitude in the equilateral triangle is 6√3 cm."
