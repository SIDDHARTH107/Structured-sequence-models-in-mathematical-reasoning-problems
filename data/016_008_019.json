    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a self-similar fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$D = \\frac{\\log N}{\\log (1/s)}$\n\nwhere $D$ is the Hausdorff dimension, $N$ is the number of self-similar pieces, and $s$ is the self-similarity ratio.\n\nFor the Koch curve, each segment is replaced by 4 segments, each of which is $\\frac{1}{3}$ times the length of the original segment. So, in this case, $N = 4$ and $s = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$D = \\frac{\\log 4}{\\log (1/(\\frac{1}{3}))} = \\frac{\\log 4}{\\log 3}$\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is:\n\n$D \\approx 1.26186$"
