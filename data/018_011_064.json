Since A and B have no common elements, their intersection is an empty set:\n\nA ∩ B = ∅\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∩ B) x A. Since (A ∩ B) is an empty set, the Cartesian product with any set will also be an empty set:\n\n(A ∩ B) x A = ∅ x A = ∅\n\nNow let's find the Cartesian products A x A and B x A:\n\nA x A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}\nB x A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow let's find the intersection of (A x A) and (B x A):\n\n(A x A) ∩ (B x A) = ∅ (since there are no common ordered pairs)\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n\n(A ∩ B) x A = ∅\n(A x A) ∩ (B x A) = ∅"
