    "message_2": "To calculate the moving average with a window size of 3 months, we will take the average of each set of 3 consecutive months starting from month 3 to month 12. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Average of months 3, 4, and 5: (28 + 30 + 32) / 3 = 90 / 3 = 30\n2. Average of months 4, 5, and 6: (30 + 32 + 33) / 3 = 95 / 3 ≈ 31.67\n3. Average of months 5, 6, and 7: (32 + 33 + 31) / 3 = 96 / 3 = 32\n4. Average of months 6, 7, and 8: (33 + 31 + 29) / 3 = 93 / 3 = 31\n5. Average of months 7, 8, and 9: (31 + 29 + 27) / 3 = 87 / 3 = 29\n6. Average of months 8, 9, and 10: (29 + 27 + 24) / 3 = 80 / 3 ≈ 26.67\n7. Average of months 9, 10, and 11: (27 + 24 + 23) / 3 = 74 / 3 ≈ 24.67\n8. Average of months 10, 11, and 12: (24 + 23 + 20) / 3 = 67 / 3 ≈ 22.33\n\nSo, the moving average from month 3 to month 12 with a window size of 3 months is:\n\n30, 31.67, 32, 31, 29, 26.67, 24.67, 22.33"
