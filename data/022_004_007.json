    "message_2": "To find the order of the singularity at z=0 for the complex function f(z) = sin(z) / (z^2 * cos(z)), we first need to determine the type of singularity at z=0.\n\nSince sin(0) = 0 and cos(0) = 1, we have f(0) = 0 / (0^2 * 1) = 0/0, which is an indeterminate form. This suggests that z=0 is a singular point for f(z).\n\nNow, let's find the Laurent series expansion of f(z) around z=0 to determine the order of the singularity. We can use the Taylor series expansions of sin(z) and cos(z) around z=0:\n\nsin(z) = z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - ...\ncos(z) = 1 - (z^2)/2! + (z^4)/4! - ...\n\nNow, we can write f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - ...) / (z^2 * (1 - (z^2)/2! + (z^4)/4! - ...))\n\nTo find the Laurent series, we need to divide the series for sin(z) by the series for z^2 * cos(z). We can do this using long division:\n\n               1/z - (1/6) + (z^2)/120 - ...\n             ________________________________________\nz^2 * (1 - z^2/2 + z^4/4! - ...) | z - (z^3)/3! + (z^5)/5! - ...\n\nAfter performing the long division, we obtain the Laurent series for f(z):\n\nf(z) = 1/z - (1/6) + (z^2)/120 - ...\n\nNow, we can see that the Laurent series has a simple pole at z=0, which means that the order of the singularity at z=0 is 1."
