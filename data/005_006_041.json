What is the probability that a random sample of 25 bulbs will have an average lifetime between 1175 and 1225 hours according to the Central Limit Theorem?",
    "message_2": "According to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed with the same mean as the population (μ = 1200 hours) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ = 100 hours) divided by the square root of the sample size (n = 25).\n\nStandard deviation of the sample mean (σ_sample_mean) = σ / √n = 100 / √25 = 100 / 5 = 20 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean is between 1175 and 1225 hours. To do this, we will standardize these values by converting them to z-scores using the formula:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ_sample_mean\n\nFor the lower limit (1175 hours):\nz_lower = (1175 - 1200) / 20 = -25 / 20 = -1.25\n\nFor the upper limit (1225 hours):\nz_upper = (1225 - 1200) / 20 = 25 / 20 = 1.25\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is between -1.25 and 1.25. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the area under the curve between these z-scores.\n\nP(-1.25 < z < 1.25) = P(z < 1.25) - P(z < -1.25)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\nP(z < 1.25) ≈ 0.8944\nP(z < -1.25) ≈ 0.2119\n\nP(-1.25 < z < 1.25) = 0.8944 - 0.2119 = 0.6825\n\nSo, the probability that a random sample of 25 bulbs will have an average lifetime between 1175 and 1225 hours is approximately 0.6825 or 68.25%."
