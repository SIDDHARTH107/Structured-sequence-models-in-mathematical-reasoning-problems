    "message_1": "In a survey of 100 students, the average score in a math test was 75. However, there were a few extreme scores that were much lower or higher than the rest. To find a more reliable measure of center, the median was also computed as 80. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) of the scores, and determine if there are any outliers in the dataset.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the interquartile range (IQR), we first need to find the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the dataset. Unfortunately, we do not have the actual dataset or enough information to directly calculate Q1 and Q3. Therefore, we cannot calculate the IQR with the given information.\n\nTo determine if there are any outliers in the dataset, we would also need the IQR. The IQR is used to calculate the lower and upper bounds for outliers. Any data point below (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) or above (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR) is considered an outlier. However, since we cannot calculate the IQR, we cannot determine if there are any outliers in the dataset with the given information."
