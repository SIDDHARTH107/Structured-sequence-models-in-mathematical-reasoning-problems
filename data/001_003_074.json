    "message_2": "First, we'll solve one of the equations for one variable. Let's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx + 2y = 7\nx = 7 - 2y\n\nNow, we'll substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n3x - y = 11\n3(7 - 2y) - y = 11\n\nNow, we'll solve for y:\n\n21 - 6y - y = 11\n21 - 7y = 11\n-7y = -10\ny = 10/7\n\nNow that we have the value of y, we'll substitute it back into the expression we found for x:\n\nx = 7 - 2y\nx = 7 - 2(10/7)\nx = 7 - 20/7\nx = (49 - 20)/7\nx = 29/7\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 29/7 and y = 10/7."
