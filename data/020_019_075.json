    "message_1": "A car is driving on a straight road and needs to come to a complete stop at a traffic light ahead. The car's initial velocity is 40 m/s and the traffic light is 200 meters away. Assume that the car's deceleration is constant and that the optimal control is to brake as much as possible without skidding.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible deceleration that the car can have and still come to a stop at the traffic light?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the following kinematic equation:\n\nv^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration (or deceleration in this case), and s is the distance.\n\nSince the car needs to come to a complete stop, the final velocity (v) will be 0 m/s. The initial velocity (u) is given as 40 m/s, and the distance (s) is given as 200 meters. We need to find the maximum possible deceleration (a) that the car can have.\n\n0 = (40)^2 + 2*a*200\n\n0 = 1600 + 400a\n\n-1600 = 400a\n\na = -1600 / 400\n\na = -4 m/s^2\n\nThe maximum possible deceleration that the car can have and still come to a stop at the traffic light is -4 m/s^2."
