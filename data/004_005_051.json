    "message_2": "To solve the given first-order linear differential equation y' + y = 5 with the initial condition y(0) = 2, we can use an integrating factor.\n\nFirst, rewrite the equation in the standard form:\n\ny' + y = 5\n\nThe integrating factor is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of y:\n\nIntegrating factor = e^(∫1 dx) = e^x\n\nNow, multiply the entire equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^x y' + e^x y = 5e^x\n\nThe left side of the equation is now the derivative of the product of y(x) and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dx (y(x)e^x) = 5e^x\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(d/dx (y(x)e^x)) dx = ∫(5e^x) dx\n\ny(x)e^x = 5e^x + C\n\nNow, solve for y(x):\n\ny(x) = 5 + Ce^(-x)\n\nApply the initial condition y(0) = 2:\n\n2 = 5 + Ce^(0)\n\nC = -3\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = 5 - 3e^(-x)"
