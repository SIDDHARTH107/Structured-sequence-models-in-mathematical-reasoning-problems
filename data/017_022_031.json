    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 60 are there, and can you provide a list of group names and their corresponding group tables?",
    "message_2": "There are two non-abelian groups of order 60: the symmetric group S_5 and the alternating group A_5.\n\n1. Symmetric group S_5:\nThe symmetric group S_5 consists of all the permutations of 5 elements. It has order 5! = 120. However, you asked for groups of order 60, so this group does not fit the requirement.\n\n2. Alternating group A_5:\nThe alternating group A_5 consists of all the even permutations of 5 elements. It has order 5!/2 = 60. This group is non-abelian and has order 60.\n\nSince providing the full group table for A_5 would be quite large (60x60 entries), I will not list it here. However, you can find the group table in various algebra textbooks or online resources. The elements of A_5 can be represented as products of disjoint cycles, and the group operation is the composition of permutations."
