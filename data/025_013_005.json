    "message_2": "To find the Jacobian of the curve C at the point P(1, 2), we first need to find the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y. The equation of the curve C is given by:\n\nF(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 + 4x - 1 = 0\n\nNow, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = -3x^2 + 4\n∂F/∂y = 2y\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the point P(1, 2):\n\n∂F/∂x(P) = -3(1)^2 + 4 = 1\n∂F/∂y(P) = 2(2) = 4\n\nFinally, we form the Jacobian matrix J at the point P(1, 2):\n\nJ(P) = | ∂F/∂x(P)  ∂F/∂y(P) |\n          |      1               4      |\n\nSo, the Jacobian of the curve C at the point P(1, 2) is:\n\nJ(P) = | 1  4 |"
