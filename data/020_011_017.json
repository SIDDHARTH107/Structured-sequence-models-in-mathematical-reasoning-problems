    "message_1": "Consider a manufacturing process, where a company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company has two machines that can be used to produce both products. It takes 3 hours on Machine 1 to produce one unit of Product A and 2 hours to produce one unit of Product B. It takes 2 hours on Machine 2 to produce one unit of Product A and 4 hours to produce one unit of Product B. The company aims to produce at least 20 units of Product A and 10 units of Product B, but due to limited machine hours, they can only allocate up to 40 hours on Machine 1 and up to 30 hours on Machine 2. \nFind the optimal production plan that maximizes the total number of units produced while satisfying the given constraints.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced on Machine 1, y be the number of units of Product B produced on Machine 1, z be the number of units of Product A produced on Machine 2, and w be the number of units of Product B produced on Machine 2.\n\nWe want to maximize the total number of units produced, which is x + y + z + w.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. 3x + 2y ≤ 40 (Machine 1 hours)\n2. 2z + 4w ≤ 30 (Machine 2 hours)\n3. x + z ≥ 20 (At least 20 units of Product A)\n4. y + w ≥ 10 (At least 10 units of Product B)\n5. x, y, z, w ≥ 0 (Non-negative units)\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraints for x and y in terms of z and w:\n\nFrom constraint 1:\ny ≤ (40 - 3x) / 2\n\nFrom constraint 2:\nw ≤ (30 - 2z) / 4\n\nNow, we will substitute the constraints 3 and 4 into the above equations:\n\ny ≤ (40 - 3(20 - z)) / 2\nw ≤ (30 - 2(10 - y)) / 4\n\nSolving for y and w:\n\ny ≤ (40 - 60 + 3z) / 2\ny ≤ (3z - 20) / 2\n\nw ≤ (30 - 20 + 2y) / 4\nw ≤ (2y + 10) / 4\n\nNow, we will substitute the expressions for y and w into the objective function:\n\nx + y + z + w = x + (3z - 20) / 2 + z + (2y + 10) / 4\n\nTo maximize the total number of units produced, we need to maximize the expression above. Since x, y, z, and w are all non-negative, we can maximize the expression by maximizing the terms with z and y.\n\nThe term with z is (3z - 20) / 2 + z, which is maximized when z = 20 (the maximum value allowed by constraint 3). In this case, x = 0.\n\nThe term with y is (2y + 10) / 4, which is maximized when y = 10 (the maximum value allowed by constraint 4). In this case, w = 0.\n\nSo, the optimal production plan is:\n\n- Produce 0 units of Product A and 10 units of Product B on Machine 1.\n- Produce 20 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B on Machine 2.\n\nThis results in a total of 0 + 10 + 20 + 0 = 30 units produced."
