    "message_1": "A company manufactures and sells its product at a constant cost of $50 per unit. The company's fixed cost is $10,000 and the current demand for the product is modeled by the equation Q = 800 - 10P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price per unit. Determine the optimal unit price that maximizes the company's profit.",
    "message_2": "To maximize the company's profit, we need to find the optimal price (P) that maximizes the profit function. The profit function can be defined as:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Total Cost\n\nRevenue can be calculated as the product of the price per unit (P) and the quantity demanded (Q). So, Revenue = P * Q.\nTotal Cost can be calculated as the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost. Variable cost is the product of the cost per unit and the quantity demanded. So, Total Cost = Fixed Cost + (Cost per unit * Q).\n\nGiven:\nCost per unit = $50\nFixed Cost = $10,000\nQ = 800 - 10P\n\nFirst, let's find the Revenue function:\nRevenue = P * Q = P * (800 - 10P)\n\nNow, let's find the Total Cost function:\nTotal Cost = Fixed Cost + (Cost per unit * Q) = 10,000 + 50 * (800 - 10P)\n\nNow, let's find the Profit function:\nProfit = Revenue - Total Cost = P * (800 - 10P) - (10,000 + 50 * (800 - 10P))\n\nTo find the optimal price that maximizes the profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking its derivative with respect to P and setting it equal to 0.\n\nLet's find the derivative of the profit function with respect to P:\nd(Profit)/dP = d(P * (800 - 10P) - (10,000 + 50 * (800 - 10P)))/dP\n\nUsing the product rule and the chain rule, we get:\nd(Profit)/dP = (800 - 10P) - P * 10 - 50 * (-10) = -20P + 800 + 500\n\nNow, let's set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for P:\n-20P + 800 + 500 = 0\n-20P = -1300\nP = 65\n\nSo, the optimal unit price that maximizes the company's profit is $65."
