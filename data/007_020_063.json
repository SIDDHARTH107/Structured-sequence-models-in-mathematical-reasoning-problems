    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext using RSA encryption, we use the formula:\n\nciphertext = (plaintext^e) % modulus\n\nIn this case, the plaintext is 10, the encryption key (e) is 7, and the modulus is 77. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nciphertext = (10^7) % 77\n\nFirst, calculate 10^7:\n\n10^7 = 10,000,000\n\nNow, find the remainder when dividing 10,000,000 by 77:\n\n10,000,000 % 77 = 62\n\nSo, the ciphertext corresponding to the plaintext message 10 is 62."
