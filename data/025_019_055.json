    "message_1": "Consider a Fano surface $\\mathbb{F}_1$ obtained by blowing up a point on a projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2$. Let $H$ be its hyperplane class and $E$ the exceptional divisor class. \n\nSuppose we have a divisor $D = a H + b E$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers. If $D^2 = -1$ and $D\\cdot H = 3$, what are the values of $a$ and $b$?",
    "message_2": "We are given the following information:\n\n1. $D^2 = -1$\n2. $D \\cdot H = 3$\n\nWe know that $D = aH + bE$, so we can substitute this into the given equations:\n\n1. $(aH + bE)^2 = -1$\n2. $(aH + bE) \\cdot H = 3$\n\nNow, we can use the intersection properties of the Fano surface $\\mathbb{F}_1$. We know that $H^2 = 1$, $E^2 = -1$, and $H \\cdot E = 0$. Using these properties, we can expand the equations:\n\n1. $(a^2H^2 + 2abH \\cdot E + b^2E^2) = -1$\n2. $(aH^2 + bH \\cdot E) = 3$\n\nNow, substitute the intersection properties into the equations:\n\n1. $(a^2(1) + 2ab(0) + b^2(-1)) = -1$\n2. $(a(1) + b(0)) = 3$\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n1. $a^2 - b^2 = -1$\n2. $a = 3$\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of $a$ from equation (2) into equation (1):\n\n$(3)^2 - b^2 = -1$\n\n$9 - b^2 = -1$\n\n$b^2 = 10$\n\nSince $b$ is an integer, there is no solution for $b$ that satisfies this equation. Therefore, there are no values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the given conditions."
