    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of $v_0$ along the curve $r(t)$, we need to solve the following equation:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\dot{r}(t)} v(t) = 0$\n\nwhere $\\nabla$ is the covariant derivative, $\\dot{r}(t)$ is the tangent vector to the curve, and $v(t)$ is the parallel transport of $v_0$.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector $\\dot{r}(t)$ by taking the derivative of $r(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n\n$\\dot{r}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(4\\sin^2 t, 4\\sin t\\cos t, 3t) = (8\\sin t\\cos t, 4(\\cos^2 t - \\sin^2 t), 3)$\n\nNow, let's write the parallel transport of $v_0$ as $v(t) = (A(t), B(t), C(t))$. We need to solve the following equation for $A(t)$, $B(t)$, and $C(t)$:\n\n$\\nabla_{\\dot{r}(t)} v(t) = \\dot{r}(t) \\cdot \\nabla v(t) = (\\dot{A}, \\dot{B}, \\dot{C}) = 0$\n\nSince $\\dot{r}(t)$ and $\\nabla v(t)$ are orthogonal, their dot product is zero:\n\n$(8\\sin t\\cos t, 4(\\cos^2 t - \\sin^2 t), 3) \\cdot (\\dot{A}, \\dot{B}, \\dot{C}) = 0$\n\nThis gives us three equations:\n\n1. $8\\sin t\\cos t \\cdot \\dot{A} = 0$\n2. $4(\\cos^2 t - \\sin^2 t) \\cdot \\dot{B} = 0$\n3. $3 \\cdot \\dot{C} = 0$\n\nFrom equation (3), we have $\\dot{C} = 0$, which implies $C(t) = C_0$ for some constant $C_0$. Since $v(0) = (4, 0, 0)$, we have $C_0 = 0$.\n\nFor equation (1), we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: $\\sin t\\cos t = 0$. This implies either $\\sin t = 0$ or $\\cos t = 0$. In either case, $A(t)$ remains constant.\n\nCase 2: $\\dot{A} = 0$. This implies $A(t) = A_0$ for some constant $A_0$. Since $v(0) = (4, 0, 0)$, we have $A_0 = 4$.\n\nFor equation (2), we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: $\\cos^2 t - \\sin^2 t = 0$. This implies $\\cos^2 t = \\sin^2 t$, which means $\\cos t = \\pm \\sin t$. In either case, $B(t)$ remains constant.\n\nCase 2: $\\dot{B} = 0$. This implies $B(t) = B_0$ for some constant $B_0$. Since $v(0) = (4, 0, 0)$, we have $B_0 = 0$.\n\nThus, the parallel transport of $v_0$ along the curve $r(t)$ is given by:\n\n$v(t) = (4, 0, 0)$"
