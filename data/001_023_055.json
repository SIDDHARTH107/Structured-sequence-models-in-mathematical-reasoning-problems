    "message_2": "To solve the equation sin(x) + cos(x) = 1, we can use the following trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(x) = cos(π/2 - x)\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\ncos(π/2 - x) + cos(x) = 1\n\nNow, let's use the angle addition formula for cosine:\n\ncos(A + B) = cos(A)cos(B) - sin(A)sin(B)\n\nIn our case, A = π/2 - x and B = x. So, we have:\n\ncos(π/2)cos(x) - sin(π/2)sin(x) = 1\n\nSince cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1, the equation simplifies to:\n\n0*cos(x) - 1*sin(x) = 1\n\nNow, we have:\n\n-sin(x) = 1\n\nHowever, the sine function has a range of -1 to 1, so there is no value of x for which sin(x) = -1. Therefore, there is no solution for x in the given range of 0 to 2π."
