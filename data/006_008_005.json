    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in the week)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on any given day\n- n is the total number of trials (days in the week)\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 7 (days in the week)\n- k = 4 (rainy days)\n- p = 0.3 (probability of rain on any given day)\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of combinations of 7 items taken 4 at a time (7C4):\n\n7C4 = 7! / (4! * (7-4)!)\n= 7! / (4! * 3!)\n= (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1))\n= (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 210 / 6\n= 35\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 4) = (35) * (0.3^4) * (1-0.3)^(7-4)\n= 35 * (0.3^4) * (0.7^3)\n= 35 * 0.0081 * 0.343\nâ‰ˆ 0.3241\n\nSo, the probability of it raining exactly 4 days next week is approximately 0.3241 or 32.41%."
