    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on x and the other depending only on y:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$$\n\nSubstitute this into the given partial differential equation:\n\n$$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2 - \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$$\n$$Y''(y) - \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0$$\n\nSolve these ODEs with the given boundary conditions:\n\nFor X(x):\n\n$$X(0) = 0$$\n$$X(1) = \\sin(1)$$\n\nFor Y(y):\n\n$$Y(0) = 0$$\n$$Y(1) = \\cos(1)$$\n\nThe general solutions for these ODEs are:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\sin(\\lambda x) + B\\cos(\\lambda x)$$\n$$Y(y) = C\\sinh(\\lambda y) + D\\cosh(\\lambda y)$$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n\n$$X(0) = B = 0$$\n$$X(1) = A\\sin(\\lambda) = \\sin(1)$$\n\n$$Y(0) = D = 0$$\n$$Y(1) = C\\sinh(\\lambda) = \\cos(1)$$\n\nNow, we have:\n\n$$X(x) = \\frac{\\sin(1)}{\\sin(\\lambda)}\\sin(\\lambda x)$$\n$$Y(y) = \\frac{\\cos(1)}{\\sinh(\\lambda)}\\sinh(\\lambda y)$$\n\nThe solution to the boundary value problem is the product of these functions:\n\n$$u(x, y) = \\frac{\\sin(1)\\cos(1)}{\\sin(\\lambda)\\sinh(\\lambda)}\\sin(\\lambda x)\\sinh(\\lambda y)$$\n\nHowever, this is only one possible solution. The full solution is a sum of solutions like this for different values of $\\lambda$. To find the full solution, we need to expand it as a Fourier series:\n\n$$u(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(n\\pi)\\cos(n\\pi)}{n\\pi\\sinh(n\\pi)}\\sin(n\\pi x)\\sinh(n\\pi y)$$\n\nThis is the solution to the given boundary value problem for $0 \\le x \\le 1$ and $0 \\le y \\le 1$."
