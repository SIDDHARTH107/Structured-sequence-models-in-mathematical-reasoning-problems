    "message_2": "A group of order 9 has either a prime order (p^2) or is a product of two prime orders (p * q). Since 9 = 3^2, there are two possibilities for the group structure: either it is a group of prime order squared (C_9) or it is a product of two prime orders (C_3 x C_3).\n\n1. If the group is of prime order squared (C_9), it is a cyclic group of order 9, generated by an element of order 9. There is only one such group up to isomorphism, which is the group of integers modulo 9 under addition, denoted as Z_9 or C_9.\n\n2. If the group is a product of two prime orders (C_3 x C_3), it is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3. There is only one such group up to isomorphism, which is the group of pairs of integers modulo 3 under component-wise addition, denoted as Z_3 x Z_3 or C_3 x C_3.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 non-isomorphic groups of order 9: C_9 and C_3 x C_3."
