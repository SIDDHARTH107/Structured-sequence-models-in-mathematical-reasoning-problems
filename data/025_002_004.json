    "message_2": "To determine the degree of the intersection of X and Y, we can use the Bézout's theorem. Bézout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two algebraic varieties in a complex projective space is equal to the product of their degrees, counted with multiplicities, provided that the intersection points are in general position.\n\nIn this case, X is a hypersurface of degree 4 and Y is a hypersurface of degree 5. Therefore, by Bézout's theorem, the degree of the intersection of X and Y is:\n\nDegree(X ∩ Y) = Degree(X) × Degree(Y) = 4 × 5 = 20.\n\nSo, the degree of the intersection of X and Y is 20."
