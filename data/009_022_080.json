Take D = 1 and R = 5.",
    "message_2": "To find the steady-state concentration u_steady(x), we need to solve the reaction-diffusion equation when ∂u/∂t = 0. This gives us the following equation:\n\n0 = Du(∂^2 u/∂x^2) + Ru(1-u)\n\nNow, let's use separation of variables. Assume that u(x, t) = X(x)T(t). Plugging this into the equation above, we get:\n\n0 = DX''(x)T(t) + RX(x)T(t)(1-X(x))\n\nDivide both sides by DX(x)T(t):\n\n0 = X''(x) + R(1-X(x))\n\nNow we have an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for X(x):\n\nX''(x) + R(1-X(x)) = 0\n\nTo solve this ODE, we can first find the homogeneous solution X_h(x) by setting R = 0:\n\nX''(x) = 0\n\nThe general solution to this ODE is:\n\nX_h(x) = Ax + B\n\nNow, let's find the particular solution X_p(x) by assuming a constant solution:\n\nX_p(x) = C\n\nPlugging this into the ODE:\n\n0 = R(1-C)\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = 1/R = 1/5\n\nSo, the general solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = Ax + B + 1/5\n\nNow, we need to apply the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, t) = X(0)T(t) = 0\nu(1, t) = X(1)T(t) = 0\n\nSince T(t) ≠ 0, we must have X(0) = X(1) = 0. Plugging in the boundary conditions into the general solution for X(x):\n\n0 = B + 1/5\n0 = A + B + 1/5\n\nSolving these equations, we get A = -1/5 and B = -1/5. Therefore, the solution for X(x) is:\n\nX(x) = -1/5x - 1/5 + 1/5 = -1/5x\n\nNow, we can find the steady-state concentration u_steady(x) by multiplying X(x) by T(t):\n\nu_steady(x) = X(x)T(t) = -1/5x * T(t)\n\nSince we are only interested in the steady-state concentration, we can ignore the time-dependent part T(t) and focus on the spatial part X(x):\n\nu_steady(x) = -1/5x\n\nThis is the steady-state concentration of the chemical species for the given reaction-diffusion equation and boundary conditions."
