    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we first need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.\n\nMatrix A:\n[[4, -1],\n [2, 1]]\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues (λ):\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI:\n[[4 - λ, -1],\n [2, 1 - λ]]\n\ndet(A - λI) = (4 - λ)(1 - λ) - (-1)(2) = λ^2 - 5λ + 6\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the equation λ^2 - 5λ + 6 = 0. This equation can be factored as (λ - 2)(λ - 3) = 0. Thus, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 3.\n\n2. Find the eigenvectors:\nNow, we need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFor λ1 = 2:\n(A - λ1I)v1 = 0\n[[2, -1],\n [2, -1]]v1 = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we have 2x - y = 0, which gives y = 2x. We can choose x = 1, so y = 2. Thus, the eigenvector v1 = [1, 2].\n\nFor λ2 = 3:\n(A - λ2I)v2 = 0\n[[1, -1],\n [2, -2]]v2 = 0\n\nFrom the first row, we have x - y = 0, which gives y = x. We can choose x = 1, so y = 1. Thus, the eigenvector v2 = [1, 1].\n\n3. Form the matrix P and D:\nNow that we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can form the matrix P using the eigenvectors as columns and the diagonal matrix D using the eigenvalues as the diagonal entries.\n\nMatrix P:\n[[1, 1],\n [2, 1]]\n\nMatrix D:\n[[2, 0],\n [0, 3]]\n\nNow, let's verify that D = P⁻¹AP.\n\nP⁻¹:\nTo find the inverse of P, we can use the formula P⁻¹ = (1/det(P))adj(P), where adj(P) is the adjugate of P.\n\ndet(P) = (1)(1) - (2)(1) = -1\n\nadj(P):\n[[1, -1],\n [-2, 1]]\n\nP⁻¹ = (1/-1) * [[1, -1],\n                [-2, 1]]\n     = [[-1, 1],\n         [2, -1]]\n\nNow, let's compute P⁻¹AP:\n\nP⁻¹AP = [[-1, 1], [2, -1]] * [[4, -1], [2, 1]] * [[1, 1], [2, 1]]\n       = [[-1, 1], [2, -1]] * [[6, 3], [0, 1]]\n       = [[-6, -2], [12, 5]]\n\nAnd indeed, we have:\n\nD = [[2, 0],\n     [0, 3]]\n\nSo, we have found the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P such that D = P⁻¹AP."
