    "message_1": "A company manufactures two types of products: A and B. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of labor, 1 hour of setup time, and 3 pounds of raw material, while each unit of product B requires 3 hours of labor, 1 hour of setup time, and 1 pound of raw material. The company has 400 hours of labor, 150 hours of setup time, and 240 pounds of raw material available. If the profit for product A is $25 and for product B is $30, how many units of each product should be produced to maximize the total profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe constraints for labor, setup time, and raw material can be written as:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 400 (labor constraint)\nx + y ≤ 150 (setup time constraint)\n3x + y ≤ 240 (raw material constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize the total profit is:\n\nP = 25x + 30y\n\nWe need to find the feasible region that satisfies all the constraints and then find the maximum value of the objective function.\n\nFirst, we'll find the points where the constraint equations intersect:\n\n1. Intersection of labor and setup time constraints:\n2x + 3y = 400\nx + y = 150\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 50 and y = 100.\n\n2. Intersection of labor and raw material constraints:\n2x + 3y = 400\n3x + y = 240\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 72 and y = 88.\n\n3. Intersection of setup time and raw material constraints:\nx + y = 150\n3x + y = 240\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 45 and y = 105.\n\nNow we'll evaluate the objective function at each of these intersection points and at the origin (0,0):\n\nP(50,100) = 25(50) + 30(100) = 1250 + 3000 = $4250\nP(72,88) = 25(72) + 30(88) = 1800 + 2640 = $4440\nP(45,105) = 25(45) + 30(105) = 1125 + 3150 = $4275\nP(0,0) = 25(0) + 30(0) = $0\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when 72 units of product A and 88 units of product B are produced, resulting in a total profit of $4440."
