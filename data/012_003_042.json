    "message_2": "An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. In other words, no two vertices in the set share an edge. To find the maximum independent set, we want to find the largest set of vertices that meet this condition.\n\nIn this graph, one possible maximum independent set is {A, E, I}. Another possible maximum independent set is {C, E, G}. Both of these sets have 3 vertices, and no two vertices share an edge.\n\nTherefore, the size of the maximum independent set is 3."
