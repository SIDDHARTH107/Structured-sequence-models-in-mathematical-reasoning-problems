    "message_1": "A circular garden has a radius of 8 meters. What is the perimeter of the garden in meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, we use the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 8 meters. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = 2π(8)\nC = 16π\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the garden is 16π meters, which is approximately 50.27 meters."
