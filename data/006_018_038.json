    "message_1": "What is the probability of a financial fraud occurring in a company if the average occurrence rate is once in every 500 transactions? If the company processes 10,000 transactions in a given year, how many occurrences of this fraud can be expected to happen in that year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of a financial fraud occurring in a company, we can use the given average occurrence rate. The probability of a financial fraud occurring is 1 in every 500 transactions. Therefore, the probability is:\n\nP(fraud) = 1/500\n\nNow, we need to find the expected number of occurrences of this fraud in a year when the company processes 10,000 transactions. To do this, we can multiply the probability of a fraud occurring by the total number of transactions:\n\nExpected occurrences = P(fraud) × Total transactions\nExpected occurrences = (1/500) × 10,000\n\nExpected occurrences = 20\n\nSo, we can expect 20 occurrences of financial fraud in the company in a given year with 10,000 transactions."
