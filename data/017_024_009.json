    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3.\n2. The number of groups of order p^n, where p is a prime and n is a positive integer, is given by the partition function p(n).\n3. The direct product of groups of order p^n and q^m, where p and q are distinct primes, is a group of order p^n * q^m.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of groups of order 2^5 and 3^1. Using the partition function p(n), we have:\n\n- p(5) = 7 for groups of order 2^5 (32).\n- p(1) = 1 for groups of order 3^1 (3).\n\nNow, we can form the direct product of these groups to obtain groups of order 96:\n\n- There are 7 * 1 = 7 groups of order 96 formed by the direct product of groups of order 2^5 and 3^1.\n\nSo, there are 7 non-isomorphic groups of order 96.\n\nNow, let's classify each of the non-abelian groups of order 96 up to isomorphism. Since all groups of order 3^1 are abelian, we only need to consider the non-abelian groups of order 2^5. There are 5 non-abelian groups of order 32:\n\n1. Dihedral group D_16: The direct product D_16 x Z_3 is non-abelian of order 96.\n2. Quaternion group Q_16: The direct product Q_16 x Z_3 is non-abelian of order 96.\n3. The semi-direct product of Z_16 and Z_2, denoted as Z_16 ⋊ Z_2: The direct product (Z_16 ⋊ Z_2) x Z_3 is non-abelian of order 96.\n4. The semi-direct product of Z_8 and Z_4, denoted as Z_8 ⋊ Z_4: The direct product (Z_8 ⋊ Z_4) x Z_3 is non-abelian of order 96.\n5. The semi-direct product of Z_4^2 and Z_2, denoted as Z_4^2 ⋊ Z_2: The direct product (Z_4^2 ⋊ Z_2) x Z_3 is non-abelian of order 96.\n\nThus, we have classified the 5 non-abelian groups of order 96 up to isomorphism:\n\n1. D_16 x Z_3\n2. Q_16 x Z_3\n3. (Z_16 ⋊ Z_2) x Z_3\n4. (Z_8 ⋊ Z_4) x Z_3\n5. (Z_4^2 ⋊ Z_2) x Z_3"
