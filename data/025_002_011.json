    "message_2": "a) To show that X has a singular point at the origin, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y, and check if they both vanish at the origin (0,0).\n\nLet F(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 3axy. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 3x^2 - 3ay\n∂F/∂y = 3y^2 - 3ax\n\nNow, we evaluate these partial derivatives at the origin (0,0):\n\n∂F/∂x(0,0) = 3(0)^2 - 3a(0) = 0\n∂F/∂y(0,0) = 3(0)^2 - 3a(0) = 0\n\nSince both partial derivatives vanish at the origin, X has a singular point at the origin.\n\nb) To find the equation of the tangent line to X at the point (a,a), we need to compute the gradient of F at this point and then use the point-slope form of a line.\n\nThe gradient of F at (a,a) is given by:\n\n∇F(a,a) = (3a^2 - 3a^2, 3a^2 - 3a^2) = (0, 0)\n\nHowever, since the gradient is zero, we cannot directly use the point-slope form. Instead, we will use implicit differentiation to find the tangent line.\n\nDifferentiating F(x, y) = 0 implicitly with respect to x, we get:\n\n3x^2 + 3y^2(dy/dx) - 3a(dy/dx) - 3ay = 0\n\nNow, we evaluate this equation at the point (a,a):\n\n3a^2 + 3a^2(dy/dx) - 3a^2(dy/dx) - 3a^2 = 0\n\nSolving for dy/dx, we get:\n\n(dy/dx) = 1\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at (a,a) is 1. Using the point-slope form, the equation of the tangent line is:\n\ny - a = 1(x - a)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ny = x\n\nc) To calculate the intersection number of the divisor defined by the equation x = a with the curve X, we need to find the points of intersection and count their multiplicities.\n\nSubstituting x = a into the equation of the curve X, we get:\n\na^3 + y^3 - 3a^2y = 0\n\nLet G(y) = a^3 + y^3 - 3a^2y. We want to find the roots of G(y) and their multiplicities.\n\nNotice that G(a) = a^3 + a^3 - 3a^2a = 0, so y = a is a root. Now, we perform polynomial division to find the other factor:\n\nG(y) = (y - a)(y^2 + ay + a^2)\n\nSince the remaining factor is a quadratic, we can use the quadratic formula to find the other roots:\n\ny = (-a ± √(a^2 - 4a^2))/2 = (-a ± a√3i)/2\n\nThe other two roots are complex conjugates, so the intersection number of the divisor x = a with the curve X is 1, corresponding to the single real intersection point (a, a)."
