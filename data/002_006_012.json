    "message_1": "What is the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 14 cm?",
    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula:\n\nCircumference (C) = π * diameter\n\nGiven the diameter is 14 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π * 14\n\nUsing the value of π as approximately 3.14159:\n\nC = 3.14159 * 14\nC ≈ 43.98226 cm\n\nSo, the circumference of the circle is approximately 43.98 cm."
