    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = |A| * cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| is the magnitude of vector A, θ is the angle between vector A and B, and cos(θ) is the cosine of the angle.\n\nGiven the magnitude of vector A is 5 units, the magnitude of vector B is 4 units, and the angle between them is 60 degrees, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = 5 * cos(60°)\n\nFirst, we need to find the cosine of 60 degrees. In trigonometry, cos(60°) = 1/2.\n\nProjection of A onto B = 5 * (1/2)\n\nProjection of A onto B = 5/2\n\nSo, the projection of vector A onto vector B is 2.5 units."
