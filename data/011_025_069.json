    "message_1": "In a combinatorial game, two players take turns removing one or two stones from a pile. The player who removes the last stone wins. Suppose there are initially 7 stones in the pile. If player A takes the first turn, what moves should they make to ensure they win the game?",
    "message_2": "To ensure that player A wins the game, they should follow this strategy:\n\n1. In the first turn, player A should remove 1 stone from the pile. This leaves 6 stones in the pile.\n2. Now, no matter whether player B removes 1 or 2 stones, player A can always remove enough stones on their next turn to make the total number of stones removed by both players equal to 3. For example, if player B removes 1 stone, player A should remove 2 stones; if player B removes 2 stones, player A should remove 1 stone.\n3. After this, there will be 3 stones left in the pile. Now, player A should simply mirror player B's moves. If player B removes 1 stone, player A should remove 2 stones; if player B removes 2 stones, player A should remove 1 stone. This way, player A will always remove the last stone and win the game."
