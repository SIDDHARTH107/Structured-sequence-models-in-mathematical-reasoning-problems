    "message_1": "Let X be a compact smooth manifold of dimension 3 and f: X -> R be a Morse function. If the critical points of f have index 0, 1 or 2, and if there are 9 critical points of f, then how many critical points of index 0, 1 and 2 does f have respectively?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the number of critical points of index 0, 1, and 2 as n0, n1, and n2, respectively. According to Morse theory, the Euler characteristic of the manifold X can be computed as the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index:\n\nχ(X) = n0 - n1 + n2.\n\nSince X is a compact smooth 3-manifold, its Euler characteristic χ(X) is equal to 0. Therefore, we have:\n\n0 = n0 - n1 + n2.\n\nWe also know that the total number of critical points is 9:\n\nn0 + n1 + n2 = 9.\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with three unknowns:\n\n1) n0 - n1 + n2 = 0,\n2) n0 + n1 + n2 = 9.\n\nTo solve this system, we can eliminate one of the variables by adding the two equations:\n\n(1) + (2) => 2n0 + 2n2 = 9.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nn0 + n2 = 4.5.\n\nSince n0 and n2 are integers (as they represent the number of critical points), this equation has no solution in integers. This means that there is some inconsistency in the problem statement, and it is not possible to determine the number of critical points of index 0, 1, and 2 under the given conditions."
