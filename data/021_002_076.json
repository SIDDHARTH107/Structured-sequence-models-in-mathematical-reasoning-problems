    "message_1": "A matrix A has eigenvalue 5 with corresponding eigenvector [1, 2, 3]. Using the power iteration method, find an approximation for the eigenvalue and eigenvector for matrix A if the initial guess vector is [1, 1, 1]. Use MATLAB or a similar software to perform the matrix operations.",
    "message_2": "To perform the power iteration method, we need to know the matrix A. However, the problem only provides the eigenvalue and eigenvector, not the matrix itself. Therefore, we cannot perform the power iteration method without the matrix A.\n\nIf you can provide the matrix A, I can help you perform the power iteration method using MATLAB or a similar software."
