    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nWe need to find the number of different possible committees with at least 2 women. We can break this down into three cases:\n\n1. There are exactly 2 women on the committee.\n2. There are exactly 3 women on the committee.\n3. There are exactly 4 women on the committee.\n\nCase 1: Exactly 2 women on the committee\nWe need to choose 2 women from 4 and 3 men from 6.\nNumber of ways to choose 2 women from 4: C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6\nNumber of ways to choose 3 men from 6: C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20\nTotal ways for case 1: 6 * 20 = 120\n\nCase 2: Exactly 3 women on the committee\nWe need to choose 3 women from 4 and 2 men from 6.\nNumber of ways to choose 3 women from 4: C(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!) = 4\nNumber of ways to choose 2 men from 6: C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15\nTotal ways for case 2: 4 * 15 = 60\n\nCase 3: Exactly 4 women on the committee\nWe need to choose 4 women from 4 and 1 man from 6.\nNumber of ways to choose 4 women from 4: C(4, 4) = 4! / (4!(4-4)!) = 1\nNumber of ways to choose 1 man from 6: C(6, 1) = 6! / (1!(6-1)!) = 6\nTotal ways for case 3: 1 * 6 = 6\n\nNow, we add the total ways for each case to find the total number of different possible committees with at least 2 women:\n\nTotal ways = 120 (case 1) + 60 (case 2) + 6 (case 3) = 186\n\nSo, there are 186 different possible committees that can be formed with at least 2 women."
