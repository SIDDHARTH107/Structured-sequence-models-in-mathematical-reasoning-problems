    "message_2": "The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 12, 18, and 24 can be found by first finding the prime factors of each number and then multiplying the highest powers of each prime factor together.\n\nPrime factors of 12: 2^2 * 3\nPrime factors of 18: 2 * 3^2\nPrime factors of 24: 2^3 * 3\n\nNow, take the highest powers of each prime factor:\n2^3 * 3^2\n\nMultiply them together:\n8 * 9 = 72\n\nSo, the LCM of 12, 18, and 24 is 72."
