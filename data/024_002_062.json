    "message_2": "To find the geodesics on the surface of a sphere, we can use the concept of great circles. A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere, and its plane passes through the center of the sphere. Geodesics on the surface of a sphere are the shortest paths between two points, and they lie on great circles.\n\nLet's consider a sphere with radius R = 5. The North Pole is at point A (0, 0, 5) and the point on the equator is B (5, 0, 0). We want to find the geodesic connecting these two points.\n\nFirst, we find the plane that contains the great circle connecting A and B. This plane passes through the center of the sphere, which is the origin O (0, 0, 0). So, the plane contains points A, B, and O.\n\nThe normal vector to this plane can be found using the cross product of the position vectors of points A and B:\n\nN = A x B = (0, 0, 5) x (5, 0, 0) = (0, 25, 0)\n\nThe equation of the plane containing the great circle can be written as:\n\nN · (X - A) = 0\n(0, 25, 0) · (x - 0, y - 0, z - 5) = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n25y = 25(z - 5)\n\nNow, we need to find the points on the sphere that lie on this plane. The equation of the sphere with radius 5 is:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 5^2 = 25\n\nSubstituting the equation of the plane into the equation of the sphere, we get:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 25\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nx^2 + 2y^2 = 0\n\nSince x^2 and y^2 are both non-negative, the only solution is x = 0 and y = 0. This means that the great circle lies in the plane x = 0, which is the YZ-plane.\n\nThe equation of the great circle in the YZ-plane is:\n\ny^2 + (z - 5)^2 = 5^2\n\nThis is the equation of a circle with radius 5 and centered at (0, 5). The geodesic connecting the North Pole and the point on the equator is a semicircle in the YZ-plane with radius 5 and centered at (0, 5). In parametric form, the geodesic can be written as:\n\nx(t) = 0\ny(t) = 5 * sin(t)\nz(t) = 5 * cos(t)\n\nwhere t varies from 0 to π."
