    "message_1": "Suppose we have a Feistel cipher structure with a block size of 64 bits, a key size of 128 bits, and 16 rounds. If we use the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the round function, how many total bits would be processed in encrypting a single 1 MB file?",
    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many 64-bit blocks are in a 1 MB file.\n\n1 MB = 1 * 1024 * 1024 bytes = 1,048,576 bytes\n1,048,576 bytes * 8 bits/byte = 8,388,608 bits\n\nSince the block size is 64 bits, we can find the number of blocks by dividing the total number of bits by the block size:\n\n8,388,608 bits / 64 bits/block = 131,072 blocks\n\nNow, let's consider the Feistel cipher structure with 16 rounds. In each round, the 64-bit block is processed using the AES round function. Therefore, for each block, the total number of bits processed is:\n\n64 bits/block * 16 rounds = 1,024 bits/block\n\nFinally, we can find the total number of bits processed for the entire 1 MB file by multiplying the number of bits processed per block by the total number of blocks:\n\n1,024 bits/block * 131,072 blocks = 134,217,728 bits\n\nSo, 134,217,728 bits would be processed in encrypting a single 1 MB file using the given Feistel cipher structure with AES as the round function."
