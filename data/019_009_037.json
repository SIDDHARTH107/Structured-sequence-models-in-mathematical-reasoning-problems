    "message_1": "Sorry, it is not possible to provide a precise numerical problem for the subtopic Intuitionistic Logic as it is a branch of mathematical logic concerned with the principles of mathematical reasoning. It deals with the study of constructive reasoning, which does not always lead to a definite answer represented by a number. Instead, it focuses on the systematic search for a proof or evidence to support a given assertion. To provide a question for a math student, we need more specific details about the topic or concept within intuitionistic logic.",
    "message_2": "I understand your point. In that case, let's consider a problem related to intuitionistic logic that doesn't require a numerical answer.\n\nProblem: Prove the Double Negation Elimination (DNE) law does not hold in intuitionistic logic.\n\nIn classical logic, the Double Negation Elimination law states that if we have a proposition P, then ¬¬P is equivalent to P. In symbols, this can be written as:\n\n¬¬P → P\n\nHowever, in intuitionistic logic, this law does not hold. To demonstrate this, we can use proof by contradiction. Suppose that DNE holds in intuitionistic logic. Then, we should be able to prove the following:\n\n¬¬(P ∨ ¬P) → (P ∨ ¬P)\n\nAccording to our assumption, we can eliminate the double negation, which gives us:\n\nP ∨ ¬P\n\nHowever, this is the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM), which is not valid in intuitionistic logic. Since assuming DNE leads to a contradiction (the validity of LEM), we can conclude that DNE does not hold in intuitionistic logic."
