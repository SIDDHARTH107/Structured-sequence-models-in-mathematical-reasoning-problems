Let's analyze each subset:\n\n1) {1} - This subset does not contain the point 2, so it is an open set according to the given topology.\n\n2) {1,3} - This subset also does not contain the point 2, so it is an open set according to the given topology.\n\n3) {2} - This subset contains only the point 2, so it is not an open set according to the given topology. To check if it's closed, we need to see if its complement is open. The complement of {2} is {1,3}, which is an open set. Therefore, {2} is a closed set.\n\n4) {2,3} - This subset contains the point 2, so it is not an open set according to the given topology. To check if it's closed, we need to see if its complement is open. The complement of {2,3} is {1}, which is an open set. Therefore, {2,3} is a closed set.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1) {1} - Open\n2) {1,3} - Open\n3) {2} - Closed\n4) {2,3} - Closed"
