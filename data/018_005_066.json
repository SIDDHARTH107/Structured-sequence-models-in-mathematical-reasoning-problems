    "message_2": "The complement of set A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. Since set A contains all odd numbers, its complement A' contains all even numbers.\n\nThe intersection of set A and its complement A', denoted as A ∩ A', represents the elements that are common to both sets A and A'. However, since set A contains all odd numbers and set A' contains all even numbers, there are no elements that are common to both sets.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of set A and its complement A' is an empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}.\n\nA ∩ A' = ∅"
