    "message_2": "To solve the equation |3x - 1| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 1 is positive or zero, so we have 3x - 1 = 7\n3x = 8\nx = 8/3\n\nCase 2: 3x - 1 is negative, so we have -(3x - 1) = 7\n-3x + 1 = 7\n-3x = 6\nx = -2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are x = 8/3 and x = -2."
