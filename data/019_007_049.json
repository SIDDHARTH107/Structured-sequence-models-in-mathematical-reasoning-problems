What can we conclude about whether John will drive to work today?",
    "message_2": "Given the information provided, we can conclude that John will not drive to work today. Since his car is in the shop, he will take the bus to work according to the third rule. Additionally, he does not have a meeting, so the second rule does not apply in this situation."
