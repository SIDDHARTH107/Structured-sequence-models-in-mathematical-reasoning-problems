    "message_1": "What is the median of the following dataset, which represents the number of hours of sleep obtained by a sample of 10 people: \n\n{4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12} \n\nUse the median as a measure of central tendency for this dataset because it is a more robust statistic than the mean.",
    "message_2": "To find the median of this dataset, we first need to ensure that the data is sorted in ascending order, which it already is:\n\n{4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12}\n\nSince there are 10 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the two middle values. In this case, the two middle values are 7 and 8.\n\nMedian = (7 + 8) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5\n\nSo, the median of this dataset is 7.5 hours of sleep."
