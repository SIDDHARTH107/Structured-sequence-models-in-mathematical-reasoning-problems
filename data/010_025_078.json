    "message_1": "Consider the topological quantum field theory applied to a sphere with radius 2. If the partition function is given by $Z(Q)=e^{3Q}$, where $Q$ represents the coupling constant, what is the partition function when the coupling constant is $Q=2$?",
    "message_2": "To find the partition function when the coupling constant is $Q=2$, we simply substitute the value of $Q$ into the given expression for the partition function, $Z(Q)=e^{3Q}$.\n\nSo, when $Q=2$, we have:\n\n$Z(2)=e^{3(2)}=e^6$\n\nThus, the partition function when the coupling constant is $Q=2$ is $Z(2)=e^6$."
