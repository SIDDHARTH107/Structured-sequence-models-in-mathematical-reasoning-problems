    "message_2": "To apply the Mean Value Theorem, we first need to define a function that represents the position of the car with respect to time. Let's call this function s(t), where s is the position of the car in kilometers and t is the time in hours.\n\nWe are given that the car travels 100 km in 2 hours. So, we have the following information:\n\ns(0) = 0 (initial position)\ns(2) = 100 (position after 2 hours)\n\nNow, we need to check if the function s(t) satisfies the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem. The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, the function s(t) represents the position of the car, which is continuous and differentiable on the interval [0, 2] (assuming the car doesn't teleport or make any abrupt, non-differentiable movements).\n\nThe average rate of change of the function s(t) over the interval [0, 2] is:\n\n(s(2) - s(0)) / (2 - 0) = (100 - 0) / 2 = 50 km/h\n\nNow, according to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists at least one point c in the interval (0, 2) such that the derivative of the function s(t) at c is equal to the average rate of change:\n\ns'(c) = 50\n\nSince s'(t) represents the instantaneous velocity of the car at time t, this means that there is at least one point in time during the trip where the car was traveling exactly 50 km/h."
