    "message_1": "Suppose a certain type of cyber attack occurs on a network with a probability of 0.07. If the network is attacked 20 times over the course of a year, what is the probability that this specific type of cyber attack occurred at least twice?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that this specific type of cyber attack occurred at least twice, we can use the complementary probability. That is, we will find the probability that this specific type of cyber attack occurred 0 or 1 times, and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nLet's use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (in this case, the specific type of cyber attack) in n trials (in this case, 20 attacks)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.07)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 20)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, we will calculate for 0 and 1)\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of 0 occurrences of the specific cyber attack:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(20, 0) * (0.07)^0 * (1-0.07)^(20-0)\nP(X = 0) = 1 * 1 * (0.93)^20\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.026\n\nNow, let's find the probability of 1 occurrence of the specific cyber attack:\n\nP(X = 1) = C(20, 1) * (0.07)^1 * (1-0.07)^(20-1)\nP(X = 1) = 20 * 0.07 * (0.93)^19\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.137\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1)\nP(X ≥ 2) = 1 - 0.026 - 0.137\nP(X ≥ 2) ≈ 0.837\n\nSo, the probability that this specific type of cyber attack occurred at least twice is approximately 0.837 or 83.7%."
