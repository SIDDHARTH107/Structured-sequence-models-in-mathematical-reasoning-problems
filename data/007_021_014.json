    "message_2": "Pollard's rho algorithm is an efficient method for finding the non-trivial factors of a composite number. Here's the algorithm applied to the number 8191:\n\n1. Choose a function f(x) and two initial values x and y (usually f(x) = x^2 + 1, x = 2, and y = 2)\n2. Iterate the following steps:\n   a. Update x using the function f(x)\n   b. Update y using the function f(f(y)) (apply f twice)\n   c. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of |x - y| and the given number (8191 in this case)\n   d. If the GCD is not 1 or the given number, it is a non-trivial factor of the given number\n\nLet's apply the algorithm:\n\nf(x) = x^2 + 1\nx = 2\ny = 2\n\nFirst iteration:\nx = f(x) = f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(2)) = f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26\nGCD(|5 - 26|, 8191) = GCD(21, 8191) = 1 (continue)\n\nSecond iteration:\nx = f(x) = f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(26)) = f(677) = 677^2 + 1 = 458330\nGCD(|26 - 458330|, 8191) = GCD(458304, 8191) = 1 (continue)\n\nThird iteration:\nx = f(x) = f(26) = 26^2 + 1 = 677\ny = f(f(y)) = f(f(458330)) = f(458330) = 458330^2 + 1 = 210066104971\nGCD(|677 - 210066104971|, 8191) = GCD(210066104294, 8191) = 1 (continue)\n\nAfter several iterations, we find that the GCD remains 1. This indicates that 8191 is a prime number and has no non-trivial factors. Therefore, the smallest factor of 8191 is 1 (trivial factor), and the only other factor is 8191 itself."
