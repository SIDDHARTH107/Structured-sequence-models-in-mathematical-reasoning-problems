    "message_2": "A Sierpinski pyramid (also known as a Sierpinski tetrahedron) is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. The size of a Sierpinski pyramid refers to the number of iterations or levels of recursion.\n\nFor a Sierpinski pyramid of size 3, we can calculate the total number of smaller triangles as follows:\n\nAt level 0 (the initial tetrahedron), there are 4 triangles (the faces of the tetrahedron).\n\nAt level 1, each of the 4 triangles is divided into 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 4 * 4 = 16 triangles.\n\nAt level 2, each of the 16 triangles is divided into 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 16 * 4 = 64 triangles.\n\nAt level 3, each of the 64 triangles is divided into 4 smaller triangles, resulting in 64 * 4 = 256 triangles.\n\nSo, the total number of smaller triangles in a Sierpinski pyramid of size 3 is 4 (level 0) + 16 (level 1) + 64 (level 2) + 256 (level 3) = 340 triangles."
