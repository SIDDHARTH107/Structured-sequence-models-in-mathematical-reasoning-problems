    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To find the girth of the graph G with 12 vertices and 22 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. First, we can calculate the average degree of the vertices in the graph. Since the graph has 22 edges and each edge connects two vertices, there are 2 * 22 = 44 \"degrees\" distributed among the 12 vertices. The average degree of a vertex in the graph is 44 / 12 â‰ˆ 3.67.\n\n2. Since the degree of each vertex is at least 2, we know that the graph must contain at least one cycle. To find the shortest cycle, we can start by considering the smallest possible cycle, which is a triangle (a cycle of length 3).\n\n3. If the graph contains a triangle, then there must be at least one vertex with a degree of at least 3 (since a triangle requires three edges connecting to a single vertex). Since the average degree is 3.67, it is possible for the graph to contain a triangle.\n\n4. To confirm the existence of a triangle, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. If we distribute the 44 degrees among the 12 vertices such that each vertex has a degree of at least 2, we will have 8 \"extra\" degrees to distribute (44 - 2 * 12 = 8). Since there are 12 vertices, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one vertex will have a degree of at least 3 (2 + 1 = 3).\n\n5. Therefore, the graph G contains a triangle, and the girth of the graph is 3."
