    "message_2": "To find the 90% confidence interval for the proportion of adults who believe in extraterrestrial life, we will use the formula:\n\nCI = p-hat ± Z * sqrt((p-hat * (1 - p-hat)) / n)\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, p-hat is the sample proportion, Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, and n is the sample size.\n\n1. Calculate the sample proportion (p-hat):\np-hat = 28/50 = 0.56\n\n2. Determine the Z-score for a 90% confidence interval:\nFor a 90% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.645 (you can find this value in a Z-score table or using a calculator).\n\n3. Calculate the standard error:\nStandard error (SE) = sqrt((p-hat * (1 - p-hat)) / n) = sqrt((0.56 * (1 - 0.56)) / 50) ≈ 0.0693\n\n4. Calculate the margin of error:\nMargin of error (ME) = Z * SE = 1.645 * 0.0693 ≈ 0.1140\n\n5. Calculate the confidence interval:\nCI = p-hat ± ME = 0.56 ± 0.1140\nLower limit = 0.56 - 0.1140 = 0.446\nUpper limit = 0.56 + 0.1140 = 0.674\n\nSo, the 90% confidence interval for the proportion of adults who believe in extraterrestrial life is approximately (0.446, 0.674)."
