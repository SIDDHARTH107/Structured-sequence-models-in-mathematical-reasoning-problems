    "message_2": "The power iteration method is an iterative algorithm used to find the largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of a matrix. The method starts with an initial approximation of the eigenvector and iteratively multiplies it by the matrix until convergence is reached. Here's the algorithm:\n\n1. Choose an initial approximation for the eigenvector, v0.\n2. Compute the next approximation, v1 = A * v0.\n3. Normalize v1.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence is reached.\n\nLet's apply the power iteration method to the given matrix A and initial approximation [1, 1, 1].\n\nMatrix A:\n[[2, 1, 1],\n [1, 2, 1],\n [1, 1, 2]]\n\nInitial approximation, v0 = [1, 1, 1]\n\nIteration 1:\nv1 = A * v0 = [[2, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2]] * [1, 1, 1] = [4, 4, 4]\nNormalize v1: v1_normalized = [1, 1, 1]\n\nIteration 2:\nv2 = A * v1_normalized = [[2, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2]] * [1, 1, 1] = [4, 4, 4]\nNormalize v2: v2_normalized = [1, 1, 1]\n\nSince v2_normalized is the same as v1_normalized, we have reached convergence. The largest eigenvector is [1, 1, 1].\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding eigenvalue. We can use the Rayleigh quotient to find the eigenvalue:\n\neigenvalue = (vT * A * v) / (vT * v)\n\nwhere v is the eigenvector and vT is its transpose.\n\neigenvalue = ([1, 1, 1] * [[2, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2]] * [1, 1, 1]) / ([1, 1, 1] * [1, 1, 1])\n\neigenvalue = (12) / (3) = 4\n\nSo, the largest eigenvalue is 4.\n\nFinal answer:\nLargest eigenvector: [1, 1, 1]\nLargest eigenvalue: 4"
