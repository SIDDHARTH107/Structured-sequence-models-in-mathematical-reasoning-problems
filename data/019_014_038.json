    "message_2": "The given formula can be interpreted as follows:\n\nThere exists a function F such that for all functions G, there exists a function H with the following properties:\n1. F(P) is true.\n2. For all natural numbers x, if x is prime and G(x) is true, then H(x) is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth value of this formula.\n\n1. F(P) is true: We can define a function F such that F(P) is true. For example, F can be a function that returns true for any input that represents a property of prime numbers.\n\n2. For all natural numbers x, if x is prime and G(x) is true, then H(x) is true: We can define a function H that returns true for any input x that is prime and satisfies G(x). Since the formula holds for all functions G, it means that H can adapt to any G and still satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the truth value of the given higher-order logic formula is true, as we can find functions F and H that satisfy the conditions for any function G."
