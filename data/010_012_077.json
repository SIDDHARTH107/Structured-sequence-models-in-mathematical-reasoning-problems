    "message_2": "To determine if $f(x)$ is a smooth function on $\\mathbb{R}$, we need to check if all its derivatives exist and are continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of $f(x)$ using the product rule:\n\n$f'(x) = (x^2)' \\cos(x) + x^2 (\\cos(x))'$\n$f'(x) = 2x \\cos(x) - x^2 \\sin(x)$\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative:\n\n$f''(x) = (2x \\cos(x) - x^2 \\sin(x))'$\n$f''(x) = 2(\\cos(x) - x\\sin(x)) - 2x\\sin(x) - x^2\\cos(x)$\n$f''(x) = 2\\cos(x) - 4x\\sin(x) - x^2\\cos(x)$\n\nWe can continue finding higher order derivatives, but it's clear that each derivative will be a combination of sine and cosine functions multiplied by polynomial functions of x. Since sine and cosine functions are smooth functions (i.e., they have derivatives of all orders and are continuous), and polynomial functions are also smooth functions, their product and sum will also be smooth functions.\n\nTherefore, $f(x) = x^2\\cos(x)$ is a smooth function on $\\mathbb{R}$."
