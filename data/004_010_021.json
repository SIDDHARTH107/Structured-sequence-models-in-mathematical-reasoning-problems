    "message_2": "To find the antiderivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2, we will apply the power rule for antiderivatives, which states that the antiderivative of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor the given function, we have three terms: 3x^2, -5x, and 2. We will find the antiderivative of each term separately and then combine them.\n\n1. Antiderivative of 3x^2:\nUsing the power rule, n = 2, so the antiderivative is (3x^(2+1))/(2+1) = (3x^3)/3 = x^3.\n\n2. Antiderivative of -5x:\nUsing the power rule, n = 1, so the antiderivative is (-5x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (-5x^2)/2 = -5x^2/2.\n\n3. Antiderivative of 2:\nSince 2 is a constant, its antiderivative is 2x (a constant times x).\n\nNow, we combine the antiderivatives of the three terms:\n\nAntiderivative of f(x) = x^3 - (5x^2)/2 + 2x + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration."
