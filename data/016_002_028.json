After each iteration, the number of sides increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each side is reduced by a factor of 3.\n\nAfter five iterations, the number of sides in the Koch snowflake is given by:\n\nnumber of sides = 3 * (4^5) = 3 * 1024 = 3072\n\nThe length of each side after five iterations is given by:\n\nside length = initial side length / (3^5) = 8 / 243\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch snowflake after five iterations is the product of the number of sides and the length of each side:\n\nperimeter = number of sides * side length = 3072 * (8 / 243) â‰ˆ 101.3333 cm"
