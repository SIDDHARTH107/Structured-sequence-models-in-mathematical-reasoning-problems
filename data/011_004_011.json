    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of permutations and combinations.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to arrange the letters in the word \"MISSISSIPPI\" without any restrictions. There are 11 letters in the word, with 4 S's, 4 I's, 2 P's, and 1 M. So, the total number of arrangements is:\n\n11! / (4! * 4! * 2! * 1!) = 34,650\n\nNow, let's find the number of arrangements where at least two I's are next to each other. We can treat the two I's as a single unit (II) and then arrange the remaining 9 units (M, S, S, S, S, P, P, I, I). There are 9! ways to arrange these units, but we need to account for the repetitions of S's and P's:\n\n9! / (4! * 2!) = 3,024\n\nHowever, this only accounts for the cases where exactly two I's are together. We need to consider the cases where three I's are together (III) and all four I's are together (IIII).\n\nFor three I's together (III), we have 8 units (M, S, S, S, S, P, P, I). There are 8! ways to arrange these units, but we need to account for the repetitions of S's and P's:\n\n8! / (4! * 2!) = 420\n\nFor all four I's together (IIII), we have 7 units (M, S, S, S, S, P, P). There are 7! ways to arrange these units, but we need to account for the repetitions of S's and P's:\n\n7! / (4! * 2!) = 105\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cases where at least two I's are together from the total number of arrangements:\n\n34,650 - 3,024 - 420 - 105 = 31,101\n\nSo, there are 31,101 ways to arrange the letters of the word \"MISSISSIPPI\" such that none of the four \"I\"s are next to each other."
