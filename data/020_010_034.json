    "message_1": "A company produces two products: Product A and Product B. Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time, while each unit of Product B requires 3 hours of labor and 2 hours of machine time. The company has 200 hours of labor available and 180 hours of machine time available. The profits for Product A and Product B are $50 and $40 per unit, respectively. How many units of Product A and Product B should be produced to maximize the company's profit, while maintaining a 10% buffer in case of unexpected events (i.e., robustness constraint)?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe labor constraint is:\n2x + 3y ≤ 200 hours of labor\n\nThe machine time constraint is:\n3x + 2y ≤ 180 hours of machine time\n\nWe also need to maintain a 10% buffer for both labor and machine time. So, we will adjust the constraints accordingly:\n\n0.9 * (2x + 3y) ≤ 0.9 * 200\n1.8x + 2.7y ≤ 180\n\n0.9 * (3x + 2y) ≤ 0.9 * 180\n2.7x + 1.8y ≤ 162\n\nThe objective function to maximize the profit is:\nP = 50x + 40y\n\nNow, we need to find the feasible region and the corner points to apply the Linear Programming method.\n\nFirst, we'll find the points where the constraints intersect:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint (1.8x + 2.7y ≤ 180) and machine time constraint (2.7x + 1.8y ≤ 162):\n\n1.8x + 2.7y = 180\n2.7x + 1.8y = 162\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\nx = 30 and y = 40\n\n2. Intersection of labor constraint (1.8x + 2.7y ≤ 180) and y-axis (x = 0):\n1.8x + 2.7y = 180\n1.8(0) + 2.7y = 180\ny = 180 / 2.7\ny = 66.67 (approx.)\n\n3. Intersection of machine time constraint (2.7x + 1.8y ≤ 162) and x-axis (y = 0):\n2.7x + 1.8y = 162\n2.7x + 1.8(0) = 162\nx = 162 / 2.7\nx = 60\n\nNow, we have the corner points of the feasible region: (0, 66.67), (30, 40), and (60, 0).\n\nWe'll now evaluate the objective function P = 50x + 40y at these corner points:\n\n1. P(0, 66.67) = 50(0) + 40(66.67) = 2666.8 (approx.)\n2. P(30, 40) = 50(30) + 40(40) = 3100\n3. P(60, 0) = 50(60) + 40(0) = 3000\n\nThe maximum profit of $3,100 is achieved when producing 30 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B."
