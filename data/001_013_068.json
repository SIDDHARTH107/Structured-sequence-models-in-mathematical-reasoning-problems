    "message_2": "To solve the radical equation √(x-3) + 2 = 5, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate the radical term.\nSubtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n√(x-3) = 5 - 2\n√(x-3) = 3\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.\n(√(x-3))^2 = 3^2\nx - 3 = 9\n\nStep 3: Solve for x.\nAdd 3 to both sides of the equation:\nx = 9 + 3\nx = 12\n\nSo, the solution to the radical equation √(x-3) + 2 = 5 is x = 12."
