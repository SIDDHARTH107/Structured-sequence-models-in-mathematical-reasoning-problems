    "message_1": "If the parameters of a Van der Pol oscillator are $m=1$, $c=1$, and $k=2$, and a periodic forcing function $F(t)=10\\sin(3t)$ is applied to the oscillator, what is the maximum amplitude of the oscillator's response?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum amplitude of the oscillator's response, we first need to write down the equation of motion for the forced Van der Pol oscillator. The equation of motion for a Van der Pol oscillator is given by:\n\n$m\\ddot{x} + c(x^2 - 1)\\dot{x} + kx = F(t)$\n\nWith the given parameters, the equation becomes:\n\n$\\ddot{x} + (x^2 - 1)\\dot{x} + 2x = 10\\sin(3t)$\n\nTo find the maximum amplitude of the oscillator's response, we need to find the steady-state solution of the equation. The steady-state solution is the particular solution that remains after the transient response has decayed away. We assume a steady-state solution of the form:\n\n$x(t) = A\\sin(3t + \\phi)$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude and $\\phi$ is the phase shift. Taking the first and second derivatives with respect to time, we get:\n\n$\\dot{x}(t) = 3A\\cos(3t + \\phi)$\n\n$\\ddot{x}(t) = -9A\\sin(3t + \\phi)$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation of motion, we get:\n\n$-9A\\sin(3t + \\phi) + (A^2\\sin^2(3t + \\phi) - 1)(3A\\cos(3t + \\phi)) + 2A\\sin(3t + \\phi) = 10\\sin(3t)$\n\nThis equation must hold for all values of $t$. Comparing the coefficients of the sine and cosine terms, we get two equations:\n\n$-9A + 2A = 10 \\Rightarrow A = -\\frac{10}{7}$ (sine term)\n\n$3A^3 - 3A = 0 \\Rightarrow A^2(A - 1) = 0$ (cosine term)\n\nSince the amplitude $A$ must be positive, we take the positive root of the cosine term equation:\n\n$A = 1$\n\nThus, the maximum amplitude of the oscillator's response is $A = 1$."
