    "message_2": "As a mathematician, I cannot provide an exact probability without specific data or a statistical model to base the calculation on. The statement only provides a qualitative description of a positive correlation between studying time and grade, but it does not give any quantitative information to calculate the probability. \n\nTo determine the probability, we would need data on the distribution of grades for students who study for at least two hours a day, or a statistical model that describes the relationship between studying time and the likelihood of getting an A grade."
