    "message_1": "Consider two vectors u = <5, 12> and v = <3, 8>. Using trigonometry, what is the dot product of u and v?",
    "message_2": "To find the dot product of two vectors u and v using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |u| and |v| are the magnitudes of the vectors u and v, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n|u| = √(5² + 12²) = √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13\n|v| = √(3² + 8²) = √(9 + 64) = √73\n\nNow, let's find the angle θ between the vectors u and v. We can use the formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)\n\nwhere u · v is the dot product of u and v, which can be found using the formula:\n\nu · v = (5 * 3) + (12 * 8) = 15 + 96 = 111\n\nNow, we can find cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = 111 / (13 * √73)\n\nNow, we can find the dot product of u and v using the formula:\n\nu · v = |u| |v| cos(θ) = 13 * √73 * (111 / (13 * √73))\n\nThe terms 13 and √73 cancel out:\n\nu · v = 111\n\nSo, the dot product of u and v is 111."
