    "message_1": "Suppose a factory produces 5000 items per day, and on average, 3 items are defective per batch of 1000 items. What is the probability that there will be at least one defective item in a randomly selected day's production?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of at least one defective item in a day's production, we can first find the probability of having no defective items and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability of an item being non-defective. Since there are 3 defective items per 1000, there are 997 non-defective items per 1000. So, the probability of an item being non-defective is:\n\nP(non-defective) = 997/1000\n\nNow, let's find the probability of all 5000 items being non-defective in a day's production. Since the items are independent, we can multiply the probabilities:\n\nP(all non-defective) = (997/1000)^5000\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having at least one defective item by subtracting the probability of all non-defective items from 1:\n\nP(at least one defective) = 1 - P(all non-defective)\nP(at least one defective) = 1 - (997/1000)^5000\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP(at least one defective) ≈ 1 - 0.00674\nP(at least one defective) ≈ 0.99326\n\nSo, the probability of having at least one defective item in a randomly selected day's production is approximately 0.99326 or 99.33%."
