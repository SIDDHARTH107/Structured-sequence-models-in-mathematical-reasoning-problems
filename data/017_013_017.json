    "message_2": "First, let's prove that G is isomorphic to one of the mentioned groups.\n\nBy Sylow's Theorem, we know that there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup and a Sylow 2-subgroup in G. Let P be a Sylow 3-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Since the order of P is 3 and the order of Q is 9, we know that P is cyclic and Q is either cyclic or a non-abelian group of order 9.\n\nNow, we know that the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is 1 or 6, and the number of Sylow 2-subgroups is 1 or 3. If there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup and one Sylow 2-subgroup, then G is the direct product of P and Q, which means G is either C18 or the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6.\n\nIf there are multiple Sylow 3-subgroups or Sylow 2-subgroups, then G is non-abelian, and we can show that G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nNow, let's determine which group G1 and G2 are isomorphic to:\n\nG1: We are given that a^9 = e, b^2 = a^5, and bab^-1 = a^4. Since a^9 = e, we know that the order of a is 9. Since b^2 = a^5, we know that the order of b is 2. We can also see that bab^-1 â‰  a, so G1 is non-abelian. Therefore, G1 is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18.\n\nG2: We are given that a^9 = e, b^2 = a^5, and bab^-1 = a^2. Since a^9 = e, we know that the order of a is 9. Since b^2 = a^5, we know that the order of b is 2. We can also see that bab^-1 = a^2, which means that G2 is abelian. Since G2 is abelian, it cannot be the non-abelian group of order 18. Since the order of a is 9 and the order of b is 2, we can conclude that G2 is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6."
