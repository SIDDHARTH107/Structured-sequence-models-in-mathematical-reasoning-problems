    "message_2": "To find all the possible ways that a group of order 18 can be isomorphic to one of the three groups given, we will analyze each group separately.\n\n1. The cyclic group C18:\nA group of order 18 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C18 if and only if it is itself a cyclic group. There is only one cyclic group of order 18, which is generated by an element of order 18. So, there is only one possibility for a group of order 18 to be isomorphic to C18.\n\n2. The non-abelian group of order 18:\nA group of order 18 is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18 if and only if it has a non-abelian structure. The non-abelian group of order 18 is given by the semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 9 and a cyclic group of order 2. The semidirect product is determined by a non-trivial homomorphism from the cyclic group of order 2 to the automorphism group of the cyclic group of order 9. The automorphism group of the cyclic group of order 9 is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 6. There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from the cyclic group of order 2 to the cyclic group of order 6, which correspond to two different non-abelian groups of order 18. So, there are two possibilities for a group of order 18 to be isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 18.\n\n3. The direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6:\nA group of order 18 is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6 if and only if it has an abelian structure and is not cyclic. The direct product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a group of order 6 can be written as C3 × C6 or C3 × (C2 × C3), where Cn denotes the cyclic group of order n. Since C3 × C6 is isomorphic to C18, which we already considered in the first case, we only need to consider the case C3 × (C2 × C3). This group is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 2, which is C3 × C3 × C2. There is only one possibility for a group of order 18 to be isomorphic to C3 × C3 × C2.\n\nIn conclusion, there are a total of 1 (cyclic) + 2 (non-abelian) + 1 (direct product) = 4 possible ways that a group of order 18 can be isomorphic to one of the three groups given."
