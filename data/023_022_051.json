    "message_2": "Using Fourier transform to calculate the present value of a bond is not applicable in this context. Fourier transform is a mathematical technique used in signal processing and other fields, but it is not relevant to bond valuation.\n\nInstead, we can use the formula for the present value of a bond, which is based on the concept of discounting future cash flows. In this case, the bond has a face value of $1,000 and a 10-year maturity, with a market interest rate of 5% compounded continuously.\n\nThe formula for the present value of a bond is:\n\nPV = FV * e^(-rt)\n\nWhere:\nPV = Present Value\nFV = Face Value\ne = Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)\nr = Market interest rate\nt = Time to maturity (in years)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nPV = $1,000 * e^(-0.05 * 10)\n\nPV = $1,000 * e^(-0.5)\n\nPV ≈ $1,000 * 0.60653\n\nPV ≈ $606.53\n\nThe present value of the bond is approximately $606.53."
