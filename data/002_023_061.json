    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius is 5 cm.\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5 cm)^2\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25 cm^2\nSurface Area = 100π cm^2\n\nApproximately, Surface Area ≈ 100 * 3.14159 cm^2 ≈ 314.159 cm^2\n\nSo, the surface area of the sphere with a radius of 5 cm is approximately 314.159 cm^2."
