    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all such automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nIn the given graph, we have 6 vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. We can observe the following symmetries:\n\n1. The graph is symmetric about the line passing through vertices A and D. This means we can swap B with C and E with F, and the adjacency will be preserved. Let's denote this automorphism as σ1.\n\n2. The graph is also symmetric about the line passing through vertices B and E. This means we can swap A with C and D with F, and the adjacency will be preserved. Let's denote this automorphism as σ2.\n\n3. The identity automorphism, denoted as id, leaves all vertices unchanged.\n\nNow let's find the automorphism group of this graph. We can generate the group by composing the two automorphisms σ1 and σ2:\n\n- id: The identity automorphism.\n- σ1: Swaps B with C and E with F.\n- σ2: Swaps A with C and D with F.\n- σ1σ2: Swaps A with B, C with D, and E with F.\n\nThus, the automorphism group of this graph has 4 elements: {id, σ1, σ2, σ1σ2}."
