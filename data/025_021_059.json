    "message_2": "To compute the numerical value of the integral, we first need to find the mirror of the cohomology classes of the line bundles $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(2)$. In the case of the Fermat Calabi-Yau threefold, the mirror map is given by the following relation:\n\n$\\psi = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\log \\lambda$\n\nwhere $\\psi$ is the complexified Kähler parameter and $\\lambda$ is the complex parameter in the mirror quintic equation. The cohomology classes of the line bundles $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(2)$ are given by $H$ and $2H$, respectively.\n\nNow, we need to find the mirrors of these cohomology classes. In the case of the Fermat Calabi-Yau threefold, the mirror map is simple, and the mirrors of the cohomology classes are given by:\n\n$H^\\vee = \\psi$\n\n$2H^\\vee = 2\\psi$\n\nNow, we can compute the integral:\n\n$\\int_{\\mathcal{O}(1)} c_1(\\mathcal{O}(1)) \\wedge c_1(\\mathcal{O}(2)) = \\int_{\\mathcal{O}(1)} H^\\vee \\wedge 2H^\\vee$\n\nSince the integral is linear, we can factor out the constants:\n\n$= 2 \\int_{\\mathcal{O}(1)} \\psi \\wedge \\psi$\n\nNow, we need to compute the integral of the product of the Kähler parameters. In the case of the Fermat Calabi-Yau threefold, this integral is given by the following formula:\n\n$\\int_{\\mathcal{O}(1)} \\psi \\wedge \\psi = \\frac{1}{5}\\psi^2$\n\nFinally, we can substitute the expression for the mirror map:\n\n$= 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\log \\lambda\\right)^2$\n\n$= \\frac{1}{5\\pi^2} (\\log \\lambda)^2$\n\nThus, the numerical value of the integral is:\n\n$\\int_{\\mathcal{O}(1)} c_1(\\mathcal{O}(1)) \\wedge c_1(\\mathcal{O}(2)) = \\frac{1}{5\\pi^2} (\\log \\lambda)^2$"
