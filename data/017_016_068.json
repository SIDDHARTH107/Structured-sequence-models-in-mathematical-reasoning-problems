    "message_2": "To determine whether G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-Abelian group of order 27, we can use the Sylow theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 27, we can write it as 3^3. By the Sylow theorems, the number of 3-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and satisfy n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). The possible values for n_3 are 1 and 3.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1\nIf there is only one 3-Sylow subgroup, then it must be normal in G. Let P be this 3-Sylow subgroup. Since the order of P is 3^2 = 9, P is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3 by the classification of groups of order p^2. In either case, P is Abelian.\n\nNow, consider the factor group G/P. Since the order of G is 27 and the order of P is 9, the order of G/P is 27/9 = 3. Thus, G/P is isomorphic to C3, which is Abelian.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphisms, if both the kernel (P) and the image (G/P) of a group homomorphism are Abelian, then the original group (G) must also be Abelian. Therefore, in this case, G is Abelian and isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 3\nIf there are three 3-Sylow subgroups, then G cannot be Abelian, as there would be no unique normal 3-Sylow subgroup. In this case, G would be a non-Abelian group of order 27.\n\nConclusion:\nG can be either isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or the non-Abelian group of order 27, depending on the number of 3-Sylow subgroups. Without more information, we cannot definitively determine which group G is isomorphic to."
