    "message_2": "To find the period and amplitude of the given function, we need to analyze its components separately.\n\nThe function f(x) is a combination of a sine function and a cosine function:\n\nf(x) = 3sin(2x + π/4) - 2cos(3x - π/3)\n\nLet's first find the period and amplitude of each component.\n\n1) For the sine function: 3sin(2x + π/4)\nAmplitude: The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the sine function, which is |3| = 3.\nPeriod: The period of a sine function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|, where B is the coefficient of x inside the sine function. In this case, B = 2. So, the period is (2π)/2 = π.\n\n2) For the cosine function: -2cos(3x - π/3)\nAmplitude: The amplitude is the absolute value of the coefficient of the cosine function, which is |-2| = 2.\nPeriod: The period of a cosine function is given by the formula (2π)/|B|, where B is the coefficient of x inside the cosine function. In this case, B = 3. So, the period is (2π)/3.\n\nNow, to find the period of the entire function f(x), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of the sine and cosine components. The LCM of π and (2π)/3 is 2π. So, the period of f(x) is 2π.\n\nHowever, finding the amplitude of the entire function f(x) is not as straightforward, since it involves both sine and cosine functions. In this case, we cannot simply add or subtract the amplitudes of the individual components. The amplitude of the combined function will depend on the specific values of x and cannot be determined as a single value.\n\nIn summary, the period of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x + π/4) - 2cos(3x - π/3) is 2π, and the amplitude cannot be determined as a single value."
