    "message_2": "Since F(ω) = 0 for all |ω| > 5, the maximum value of the frequency domain function |F(ω)| must occur within the range -5 ≤ ω ≤ 5. However, we do not have enough information about the specific function f(x) or its Fourier transform F(ω) to determine the exact maximum value of |F(ω)| within this range."
