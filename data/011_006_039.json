    "message_1": "Suppose you have 4 identical orange balls and 5 identical white balls. In how many ways can you arrange these balls in a line if the first ball in the line must be orange and the last ball must be white?",
    "message_2": "Since the first ball must be orange and the last ball must be white, we are left with arranging 3 orange balls and 4 white balls in the remaining positions. There are a total of 7 positions left to fill.\n\nWe can think of this problem as choosing 3 positions for the orange balls out of the 7 available positions, and the remaining positions will be filled by the white balls. This can be calculated using combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the balls can be found using the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 7 (total positions) and k = 3 (positions for orange balls).\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!)\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!)\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((3 × 2 × 1) × (4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5) / (3 × 2 × 1)\nC(7, 3) = 210 / 6\nC(7, 3) = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 ways to arrange the 4 identical orange balls and 5 identical white balls in a line with the first ball being orange and the last ball being white."
