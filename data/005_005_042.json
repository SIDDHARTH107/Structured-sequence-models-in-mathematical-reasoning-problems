    "message_2": "To find the probability of exactly 40 visitors to the website on a given day, we will use the formula for the Poisson distribution:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k visitors\n- λ is the mean number of visitors (in this case, 50)\n- k is the number of visitors we want to find the probability for (in this case, 40)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 40) = (e^(-50) * 50^40) / 40!\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\n1. Calculate e^(-50): \ne^(-50) ≈ 1.928749847963918e-22\n\n2. Calculate 50^40:\n50^40 ≈ 9.094947017729282e+67\n\n3. Calculate 40! (factorial):\n40! = 40 × 39 × 38 × ... × 2 × 1 = 8.159152832478977e+47\n\n4. Calculate the probability:\nP(X = 40) = (1.928749847963918e-22 * 9.094947017729282e+67) / 8.159152832478977e+47\nP(X = 40) ≈ 2.137710651684677e-03\n\nSo, the probability of exactly 40 visitors to the website on a given day is approximately 0.00214 or 0.214%."
