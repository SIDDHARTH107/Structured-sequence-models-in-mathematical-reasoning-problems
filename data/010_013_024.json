    "message_2": "Since the Euler class $e(E) = 0$, we know that the Euler characteristic of the vector bundle is zero. Recall that the Euler characteristic of a vector bundle is the alternating sum of its Betti numbers, which are the dimensions of its cohomology groups. In particular, we have\n\n$$\\chi(E) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\dim M} (-1)^i \\dim H^i(M, E) = 0.$$\n\nNow, we use the fact that $r \\geq 2$. Consider the Whitney sum of the vector bundle $E$ with its dual bundle $E^*$, denoted by $E \\oplus E^*$. This is a rank $2r$ vector bundle over $M$. Since $E$ and $E^*$ have the same Euler class, we have\n\n$$e(E \\oplus E^*) = e(E) + e(E^*) = 0.$$\n\nNow, we apply the Thom isomorphism theorem, which states that for a vector bundle $F$ over $M$, there is an isomorphism between the cohomology groups of $M$ and the cohomology groups of the total space of $F$:\n\n$$H^i(M, F) \\cong H^{i+\\text{rank}(F)}(M).$$\n\nApplying this to the Whitney sum $E \\oplus E^*$, we have\n\n$$H^i(M, E \\oplus E^*) \\cong H^{i+2r}(M).$$\n\nSince $M$ is compact, its cohomology groups are finite-dimensional, and we have\n\n$$\\chi(E \\oplus E^*) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\dim M} (-1)^i \\dim H^i(M, E \\oplus E^*) = 0.$$\n\nNow, consider the short exact sequence of vector bundles:\n\n$$0 \\rightarrow E \\rightarrow E \\oplus E^* \\rightarrow E^* \\rightarrow 0.$$\n\nThis induces a long exact sequence in cohomology:\n\n$$\\cdots \\rightarrow H^i(M, E) \\rightarrow H^i(M, E \\oplus E^*) \\rightarrow H^i(M, E^*) \\rightarrow H^{i+1}(M, E) \\rightarrow \\cdots$$\n\nSince $\\chi(E \\oplus E^*) = 0$, there exists some $i$ such that $\\dim H^i(M, E \\oplus E^*) > 0$. By the long exact sequence, this implies that either $\\dim H^i(M, E) > 0$ or $\\dim H^i(M, E^*) > 0$. Without loss of generality, assume $\\dim H^i(M, E) > 0$. Then there exists a non-zero cohomology class $[\\alpha] \\in H^i(M, E)$.\n\nNow, consider the Poincaré dual of $[\\alpha]$, denoted by $[D] \\in H_{\\dim M - i}(M)$. By the Poincaré duality, there exists a cycle $D$ representing $[D]$ such that the intersection number of $D$ with the Poincaré dual of $[\\alpha]$ is non-zero:\n\n$$\\langle D, PD([\\alpha]) \\rangle \\neq 0.$$\n\nThis implies that there exists a non-vanishing section of $E$ over the cycle $D$. Since $D$ is a non-empty subset of $M$, we have found a non-vanishing section of $E$ over $M$."
