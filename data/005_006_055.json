    "message_2": "To find the probability that the sample mean will be between 41.5 and 42.5 inches, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed if the sample size is large enough (n ≥ 30).\n\nIn this case, the sample size is 100, which is large enough. The mean of the sampling distribution (μx̄) is equal to the population mean (μ), which is 42 inches. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (σx̄) is equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n):\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n = 2 / √100 = 2 / 10 = 0.2 inches\n\nNow, we need to find the z-scores for 41.5 and 42.5 inches:\n\nz1 = (41.5 - μx̄) / σx̄ = (41.5 - 42) / 0.2 = -0.5 / 0.2 = -2.5\nz2 = (42.5 - μx̄) / σx̄ = (42.5 - 42) / 0.2 = 0.5 / 0.2 = 2.5\n\nNext, we can use a standard normal table or a calculator to find the probabilities associated with these z-scores:\n\nP(z1) = P(z ≤ -2.5) ≈ 0.0062\nP(z2) = P(z ≤ 2.5) ≈ 0.9938\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that the sample mean will be between 41.5 and 42.5 inches by subtracting the probabilities:\n\nP(41.5 ≤ x̄ ≤ 42.5) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.9938 - 0.0062 = 0.9876\n\nSo, there is approximately a 98.76% probability that the sample mean will be between 41.5 and 42.5 inches."
