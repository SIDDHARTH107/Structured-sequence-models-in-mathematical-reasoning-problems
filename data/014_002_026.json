    "message_2": "To find the secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice computes her public key (A) using the formula: A = g^a mod p\n2. Bob computes his public key (B) using the formula: B = g^b mod p\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula: S = B^a mod p\n4. Bob computes the shared secret key (S) using the formula: S = A^b mod p\n\nLet's calculate the secret key:\n\n1. Alice's public key (A):\nA = g^a mod p\nA = 6^3 mod 13\nA = 216 mod 13\nA = 3\n\n2. Bob's public key (B):\nB = g^b mod p\nB = 6^5 mod 13\nB = 7776 mod 13\nB = 10\n\n3. Alice computes the shared secret key (S):\nS = B^a mod p\nS = 10^3 mod 13\nS = 1000 mod 13\nS = 12\n\n4.
