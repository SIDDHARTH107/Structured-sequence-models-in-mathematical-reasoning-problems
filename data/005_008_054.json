    "message_2": "To calculate the average daily sales, we need to find the sum of the sales and divide it by the number of days.\n\nSum of sales: 3 + 6 + 8 + 5 + 10 + 7 = 39\nNumber of days: 6\n\nAverage daily sales: 39 / 6 = 6.5 thousand dollars\n\nTo analyze the trend, we can look at the overall direction of the sales over the 6 days. The sales started at 3, increased to 8, dropped to 5, and then increased again to 10 before dropping slightly to 7. There is no clear linear trend, but we can see that the sales are generally increasing with some fluctuations."
