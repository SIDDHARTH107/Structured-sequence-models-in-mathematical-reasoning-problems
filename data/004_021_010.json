    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function, we first need to find the first derivative and then differentiate it once more.\n\nThe given function is f(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative, f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 + 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 2)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 4 * 3x^(4-1) + 3 * 2x^(3-1) - 2 * 5x^(2-1) + 7\n\nf'(x) = 12x^3 + 6x^2 - 10x + 7\n\nNow, let's find the second derivative, f''(x):\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^3 + 6x^2 - 10x + 7)\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation again, we get:\n\nf''(x) = 3 * 12x^(3-1) + 2 * 6x^(2-1) - 10\n\nf''(x) = 36x^2 + 12x - 10\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x - 2 is f''(x) = 36x^2 + 12x - 10."
