    "message_2": "To find the smallest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of 3, we can use the concept of base-3 (ternary) representation.\n\nIn base-3 representation, every number can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 3, with coefficients of either 0, 1, or 2. For example, the number 8 can be expressed as 2*(3^1) + 1*(3^0) = 6 + 2 = 8 in base-3 representation.\n\nHowever, if we restrict the coefficients to only 0 or 1, we will find the smallest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of 3.\n\nLet's consider the base-3 representation of numbers:\n\n1 = 1*(3^0) = 1\n2 = 2*(3^0) = 2\n3 = 1*(3^1) = 3\n4 = 1*(3^1) + 1*(3^0) = 3 + 1 = 4\n5 = 1*(3^1) + 2*(3^0) = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nThe next number, 6, cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of 3 with coefficients of only 0 or 1. In base-3 representation, 6 = 2*(3^1), which has a coefficient of 2.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of 3 is 6."
