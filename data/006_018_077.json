    "message_1": "A certain type of financial fraud occurs in 10% of all companies within the oil and gas industry. If an investor randomly selects 7 oil and gas companies to invest in, what is the probability that at least one of the companies will have experienced this type of financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least one of the companies will have experienced this type of financial fraud, we can first find the probability that none of the companies have experienced the fraud and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that a single company has not experienced the fraud is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.\n\nSince the investor is selecting 7 companies, the probability that none of them have experienced the fraud is (0.90)^7.\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least one company has experienced the fraud by subtracting the probability that none have experienced it from 1:\n\nProbability (at least one company has experienced fraud) = 1 - (0.90)^7\n\n= 1 - 0.4782969\n\n= 0.5217031\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the companies will have experienced this type of financial fraud is approximately 52.17%."
