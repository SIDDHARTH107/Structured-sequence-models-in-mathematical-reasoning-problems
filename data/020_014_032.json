    "message_2": "To solve the given optimization problem using the Gradient Descent algorithm, we first need to find the gradient (first derivative) of the function f(x) with respect to x. \n\nThe function is f(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 2. \n\nThe first derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 9x^2\n\nNow, we will use the Gradient Descent algorithm with the given parameters:\n\nInitial value of x: x = 0.5\nLearning rate: α = 0.1\nTolerance level: ε = 0.001\n\nWe will update x using the following formula until the absolute change in x is less than the tolerance level:\n\nx_new = x_old - α * f'(x_old)\n\nLet's start iterating:\n\nIteration 1:\nx_old = 0.5\nf'(x_old) = 4(0.5)^3 - 9(0.5)^2 = -2.0\nx_new = 0.5 - 0.1 * (-2.0) = 0.7\n\nIteration 2:\nx_old = 0.7\nf'(x_old) = 4(0.7)^3 - 9(0.7)^2 = -1.176\nx_new = 0.7 - 0.1 * (-1.176) = 0.8176\n\nIteration 3:\nx_old = 0.8176\nf'(x_old) = 4(0.8176)^3 - 9(0.8176)^2 = -0.5684\nx_new = 0.8176 - 0.1 * (-0.5684) = 0.87424\n\nIteration 4:\nx_old = 0.87424\nf'(x_old) = 4(0.87424)^3 - 9(0.87424)^2 = -0.2431\nx_new = 0.87424 - 0.1 * (-0.2431) = 0.89955\n\nIteration 5:\nx_old = 0.89955\nf'(x_old) = 4(0.89955)^3 - 9(0.89955)^2 = -0.0799\nx_new = 0.89955 - 0.1 * (-0.0799) = 0.90754\n\nThe absolute change in x between iterations 4 and 5 is |0.90754 - 0.89955| = 0.00799, which is less than the tolerance level of 0.001. Therefore, we can stop the iterations here.\n\nThe final value of x is approximately 0.90754. Now, let's find the corresponding minimum value of f(x):\n\nf(x) = (0.90754)^4 - 3(0.90754)^3 + 2 = -0.9611\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) achieved is approximately -0.9611."
