    "message_2": "In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In this case, the adjacent side has a length of 3 cm and the hypotenuse has a length of 5 cm. Therefore, the cosine of the angle between them is:\n\ncosine(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse\ncosine(angle) = 3 cm / 5 cm\ncosine(angle) = 0.6"
