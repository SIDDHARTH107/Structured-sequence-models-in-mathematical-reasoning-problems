    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA double pendulum consists of two arms with lengths 1 m and 0.5 m, respectively. If the upper arm is released from an angle of 30 degrees with respect to the vertical and the lower arm is initially at rest, what is the maximum angle made by the upper arm during its swing? Assume that the mass of each arm can be approximated as a point mass and that the system is subject to no external forces. Round your final answer to the nearest degree.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to use the conservation of energy principle. The total mechanical energy of the double pendulum system is conserved, which means that the sum of the potential and kinetic energies remains constant throughout the motion.\n\nLet's denote the angles made by the upper and lower arms with respect to the vertical as θ1 and θ2, respectively. The initial conditions are θ1 = 30 degrees and θ2 = 0 degrees. We can convert the angles to radians: θ1 = π/6 radians and θ2 = 0 radians.\n\nThe initial potential energy (PE_initial) of the system can be calculated as follows:\n\nPE_initial = m * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2)))\n\nwhere m is the mass of each arm (which will cancel out later), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²), L1 is the length of the upper arm (1 m), and L2 is the length of the lower arm (0.5 m).\n\nPE_initial = m * g * (1 * (1 - cos(π/6)) + 0.5 * (1 - cos(0)))\nPE_initial = m * g * (1 * (1 - √3/2) + 0.5 * (1 - 1))\nPE_initial = m * g * (1 - √3/2)\n\nAt the maximum angle of the upper arm (θ1_max), the lower arm will be at its lowest point (θ2 = 0), and the system will have no kinetic energy. Thus, the total mechanical energy will be equal to the potential energy at this point (PE_max):\n\nPE_max = m * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_max)) + L2 * (1 - cos(θ2)))\n\nSince the total mechanical energy is conserved, we have:\n\nPE_initial = PE_max\n\nm * g * (1 - √3/2) = m * g * (L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_max)))\n\nNow, we can solve for θ1_max:\n\n1 - √3/2 = L1 * (1 - cos(θ1_max))\n1 - √3/2 = 1 * (1 - cos(θ1_max))\ncos(θ1_max) = √3/2\nθ1_max = arccos(√3/2)\n\nθ1_max ≈ 0.5236 radians\n\nConverting back to degrees:\n\nθ1_max ≈ 30 degrees\n\nSo, the maximum angle made by the upper arm during its swing is approximately 30 degrees."
