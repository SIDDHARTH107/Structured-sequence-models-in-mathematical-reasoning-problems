    "message_2": "To find the values of z such that f(z) = 0, we need to solve the equation:\n\nz^2 + 2iz + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the complex plane. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for z:\n\nz = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 2i, and c = 2. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nz = (-2i ± √((2i)^2 - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1)\n\nz = (-2i ± √(-4 + 8)) / 2\n\nz = (-2i ± √4) / 2\n\nSince the square root of 4 is 2, we have two possible solutions for z:\n\nz = (-2i + 2) / 2 = 1 - i\nz = (-2i - 2) / 2 = -1 - i\n\nSo the values of z such that f(z) = 0 are z = 1 - i and z = -1 - i."
