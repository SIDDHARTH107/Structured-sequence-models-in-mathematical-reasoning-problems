    "message_1": "A sinusoidal wave is given by the equation y = 5sin(2x + pi/3). What is the phase shift of the wave?",
    "message_2": "The general equation for a sinusoidal wave is y = A*sin(Bx + C), where A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, and C is the phase shift. In the given equation, y = 5sin(2x + pi/3), we can see that the phase shift C = pi/3.\n\nSo, the phase shift of the wave is pi/3 radians."
