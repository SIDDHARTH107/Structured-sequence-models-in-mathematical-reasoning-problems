    "message_1": "Given a Feistel cipher structure with a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 128 bits, using 16 rounds and a round function that involves a substitution-permutation network (SPN), how many key bits are used in each round?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher with a key size of 128 bits and 16 rounds, the key is typically divided into subkeys for each round. To determine the number of key bits used in each round, we can simply divide the total key size by the number of rounds:\n\n128 bits (total key size) / 16 rounds = 8 bits per round\n\nSo, 8 key bits are used in each round of the Feistel cipher."
