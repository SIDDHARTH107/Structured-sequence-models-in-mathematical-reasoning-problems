    "message_2": "To find all the points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10 over the finite field F11, we need to test all possible x and y values in the field and check if they satisfy the equation. The finite field F11 has elements {0, 1, 2, ..., 10}. We will also include the point at infinity, denoted as O, which is always on an elliptic curve.\n\nWe can start by iterating through all the x values and computing the right-hand side of the equation (x^3 + 7x + 10) modulo 11. Then, we will check if there exists a y value such that y^2 is congruent to the computed value modulo 11.\n\n1. For x = 0:\nRHS = (0^3 + 7*0 + 10) % 11 = 10\ny^2 ≡ 10 (mod 11) has no solutions in F11.\n\n2. For x = 1:\nRHS = (1^3 + 7*1 + 10) % 11 = 8\ny^2 ≡ 8 (mod 11) has solutions y = 3 and y = 8.\n\n3. For x = 2:\nRHS = (2^3 + 7*2 + 10) % 11 = 6\ny^2 ≡ 6 (mod 11) has no solutions in F11.\n\n4. For x = 3:\nRHS = (3^3 + 7*3 + 10) % 11 = 9\ny^2 ≡ 9 (mod 11) has solutions y = 5 and y = 6.\n\n5. For x = 4:\nRHS = (4^3 + 7*4 + 10) % 11 = 7\ny^2 ≡ 7 (mod 11) has no solutions in F11.\n\n6. For x = 5:\nRHS = (5^3 + 7*5 + 10) % 11 = 1\ny^2 ≡ 1 (mod 11) has solutions y = 1 and y = 10.\n\n7. For x = 6:\nRHS = (6^3 + 7*6 + 10) % 11 = 4\ny^2 ≡ 4 (mod 11) has solutions y = 2 and y = 9.\n\n8. For x = 7:\nRHS = (7^3 + 7*7 + 10) % 11 = 3\ny^2 ≡ 3 (mod 11) has no solutions in F11.\n\n9. For x = 8:\nRHS = (8^3 + 7*8 + 10) % 11 = 5\ny^2 ≡ 5 (mod 11) has no solutions in F11.\n\n10. For x = 9:\nRHS = (9^3 + 7*9 + 10) % 11 = 2\ny^2 ≡ 2 (mod 11) has no solutions in F11.\n\n11. For x = 10:\nRHS = (10^3 + 7*10 + 10) % 11 = 0\ny^2 ≡ 0 (mod 11) has a solution y = 0.\n\nSo, the points on the elliptic curve are:\nO, (1, 3), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 1), (5, 10), (6, 2), (6, 9), and (10, 0)."
