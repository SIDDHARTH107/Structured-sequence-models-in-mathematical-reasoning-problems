    "message_1": "A factory produces widgets that weigh between 100 and 150 grams. If you were to use fuzzy logic to categorize a widget as \"light\", \"medium\", or \"heavy\", what are the membership functions for each category?",
    "message_2": "To create membership functions for each category, we need to define the range of weights for \"light\", \"medium\", and \"heavy\" widgets. Let's assume the following ranges:\n\n1. Light: 100-125 grams\n2. Medium: 115-135 grams\n3. Heavy: 125-150 grams\n\nNote that there is an overlap between the categories, which is typical in fuzzy logic systems. Now, we can define the membership functions for each category using triangular membership functions.\n\n1. Light (L): \n   - µL(x) = (125 - x) / (125 - 100) for 100 ≤ x ≤ 125\n   - µL(x) = 0 for x > 125\n\n2. Medium (M): \n   - µM(x) = (x - 115) / (130 - 115) for 115 ≤ x ≤ 130\n   - µM(x) = (135 - x) / (135 - 130) for 130 < x ≤ 135\n   - µM(x) = 0 for x < 115 or x > 135\n\n3. Heavy (H): \n   - µH(x) = (x - 125) / (150 - 125) for 125 ≤ x ≤ 150\n   - µH(x) = 0 for x < 125\n\nThese membership functions will give a degree of membership between 0 and 1 for each category based on the weight of a widget."
