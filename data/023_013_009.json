    "message_1": "A metal rod is 50 cm long and has a diameter of 2 cm. The rod initially has a temperature of 80°C. If one end of the rod is suddenly immersed in ice water at 0°C, and the other end of the rod is insulated, how long will it take for the temperature at the center of the rod to reach 10°C? Use Fourier transform to solve the problem. The thermal diffusivity of the rod is 0.1 cm²/s.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation with the Fourier transform. The equation is:\n\n∂T(x,t)/∂t = α ∂²T(x,t)/∂x²\n\nwhere T(x,t) is the temperature at position x and time t, and α is the thermal diffusivity (0.1 cm²/s).\n\nFirst, we need to set up the boundary conditions:\n\n1. T(0,t) = 0°C (one end of the rod is in ice water)\n2. ∂T(L,t)/∂x = 0 (the other end of the rod is insulated)\n3. T(x,0) = 80°C (initial temperature of the rod)\n\nWe can solve the heat conduction equation using the Fourier transform. The solution is given by:\n\nT(x,t) = (80/2) * [erfc((x-25)/(2*sqrt(α*t))) + erfc((x+25)/(2*sqrt(α*t)))]\n\nwhere erfc is the complementary error function.\n\nNow, we want to find the time t when the temperature at the center of the rod (x = 25 cm) reaches 10°C:\n\n10 = (80/2) * [erfc((25-25)/(2*sqrt(α*t))) + erfc((25+25)/(2*sqrt(α*t)))]\n\nSolving for t:\n\n0.25 = erfc(25/(2*sqrt(α*t)))\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of the complementary error function:\n\nerfc^(-1)(0.25) = 25/(2*sqrt(α*t))\n\nUsing a calculator or a table of erfc values, we find that erfc^(-1)(0.25) ≈ 0.2253.\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = (25/(2*sqrt(α)*0.2253))^2\n\nt ≈ (25/(2*sqrt(0.1)*0.2253))^2\n\nt ≈ 196.6 s\n\nSo, it will take approximately 196.6 seconds for the temperature at the center of the rod to reach 10°C."
