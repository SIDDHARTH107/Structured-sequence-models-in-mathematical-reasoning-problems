    "message_1": "Sure, here is a question for a math student to solve:\n\nA principal wants to hire an agent to sell their product in a market that has two types of consumers, high-demand and low-demand. The probability of encountering high-demand consumers is 0.6, while the probability of encountering low-demand consumers is 0.4. The product can be sold for $20 to high-demand consumers and $10 to low-demand consumers. If the agent decides to sell the product, there is a possibility that they may lie about the demand and claim that they only encountered low-demand consumers, in which case the principal will only pay them $5. If the agent tells the truth about the demand, the principal will compensate them with a commission of $12 for every high-demand consumer and $8 for every low-demand consumer. The agent's payoffs depend on their decision to lie or tell the truth, and the principal's payoffs depend on the agent's decision as well. If the agent is risk-neutral, what strategy should they choose?\n\nWhat is the expected payoff for the agent if they decide to tell the truth?\n\nWhat is the expected payoff for the agent if they decide to lie? \n\nWhat is the principal's maximum expected profit in this scenario?",
    "message_2": "First, let's calculate the expected payoffs for the agent if they decide to tell the truth:\n\nExpected payoff (truth) = (probability of high-demand * commission for high-demand) + (probability of low-demand * commission for low-demand)\nExpected payoff (truth) = (0.6 * $12) + (0.4 * $8)\nExpected payoff (truth) = $7.20 + $3.20\nExpected payoff (truth) = $10.40\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected payoffs for the agent if they decide to lie:\n\nExpected payoff (lie) = (probability of high-demand * commission for lying) + (probability of low-demand * commission for lying)\nExpected payoff (lie) = (0.6 * $5) + (0.4 * $5)\nExpected payoff (lie) = $3 + $2\nExpected payoff (lie) = $5\n\nSince the expected payoff for telling the truth ($10.40) is higher than the expected payoff for lying ($5), the agent should choose to tell the truth.\n\nNow, let's calculate the principal's maximum expected profit in this scenario:\n\nExpected profit (truth) = (probability of high-demand * (price for high-demand - commission for high-demand)) + (probability of low-demand * (price for low-demand - commission for low-demand))\nExpected profit (truth) = (0.6 * ($20 - $12)) + (0.4 * ($10 - $8))\nExpected profit (truth) = (0.6 * $8) + (0.4 * $2)\nExpected profit (truth) = $4.80 + $0.80\nExpected profit (truth) = $5.60\n\nThe principal's maximum expected profit in this scenario is $5.60."
