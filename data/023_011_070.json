    "message_1": "A 100 Hz sine wave signal is being transmitted through a communication channel. Due to various disturbances in the channel, the received signal gets distorted. The distorted signal can be modeled by the function: \n\nf(t) = 2 sin (50πt) + 3 cos (10πt) + 5 sin (200πt) \n\nFind the Fourier transform of the distorted signal and analyze the behavior of the system.",
    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the distorted signal, we will use the following definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-jωt)] dt, where j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1), ω is the angular frequency, and the integral is taken over all time.\n\nGiven the distorted signal f(t) = 2 sin(50πt) + 3 cos(10πt) + 5 sin(200πt), we can rewrite it using Euler's formula:\n\nf(t) = 2[1/2j(e^(j50πt) - e^(-j50πt))] + 3[1/2(e^(j10πt) + e^(-j10πt))] + 5[1/2j(e^(j200πt) - e^(-j200πt))]\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier transform of each term separately and then sum them up.\n\nFor the first term:\n\nF1(ω) = ∫[1/2j(e^(j50πt) - e^(-j50πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n= 1/2j[∫(e^(j(50π-ω)t) dt - ∫(e^(j(-50π-ω)t) dt]\n\nFor the second term:\n\nF2(ω) = ∫[1/2(e^(j10πt) + e^(-j10πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n= 1/2[∫(e^(j(10π-ω)t) dt + ∫(e^(j(-10π-ω)t) dt]\n\nFor the third term:\n\nF3(ω) = ∫[1/2j(e^(j200πt) - e^(-j200πt)) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n= 1/2j[∫(e^(j(200π-ω)t) dt - ∫(e^(j(-200π-ω)t) dt]\n\nNow, we can sum up the Fourier transforms of each term:\n\nF(ω) = F1(ω) + F2(ω) + F3(ω)\n\nThe integrals in F(ω) will be non-zero only when the exponent of e is zero. This happens when ω = ±50π, ±10π, and ±200π. Therefore, the Fourier transform will have non-zero values (impulses) at these frequencies.\n\nAnalyzing the behavior of the system, we can see that the original 100 Hz sine wave (corresponding to ±100π angular frequency) has been distorted with the addition of two more frequency components: a 5 Hz cosine wave (corresponding to ±10π angular frequency) and a 200 Hz sine wave (corresponding to ±200π angular frequency). The communication channel has introduced these additional frequency components, which can be seen in the Fourier transform of the distorted signal."
