    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation using complex analysis tools, we first rewrite the equation as a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients:\n\n$y''(x) + 4y(x) = 0$\n\nNow, we propose a solution of the form $y(x) = e^{rx}$, where $r$ is a complex number. Substituting this into the differential equation, we get:\n\n$(re^{rx})' + 4e^{rx} = 0$\n\n$r^2e^{rx} + 4e^{rx} = 0$\n\nSince $e^{rx}$ is never zero, we can divide both sides by $e^{rx}$:\n\n$r^2 + 4 = 0$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get:\n\n$r^2 = -4$\n\n$r = \\pm 2i$\n\nThus, we have two linearly independent solutions:\n\n$y_1(x) = e^{2ix}$ and $y_2(x) = e^{-2ix}$\n\nThe general solution is a linear combination of these two solutions:\n\n$y(x) = C_1e^{2ix} + C_2e^{-2ix}$\n\nNow, we apply the initial conditions to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\n1. $y(0) = 1$:\n\n$1 = C_1e^{0} + C_2e^{0}$\n\n$1 = C_1 + C_2$\n\n2. $y'(0) = i$:\n\n$y'(x) = 2iC_1e^{2ix} - 2iC_2e^{-2ix}$\n\n$i = 2iC_1 - 2iC_2$\n\nDividing by $2i$, we get:\n\n$1 = C_1 - C_2$\n\nSolving the system of equations, we find:\n\n$C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 0$\n\nThus, the solution to the differential equation that satisfies the initial conditions is:\n\n$y(x) = e^{2ix}$"
