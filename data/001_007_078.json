    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 3 < 7x - 5, we need to isolate x on one side of the inequality. \n\nStep 1: Subtract 2x from both sides of the inequality.\n3 < 5x - 5\n\nStep 2: Add 5 to both sides of the inequality.\n8 < 5x\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides of the inequality by 5.\n8/5 < x\n\nSo, the solution is x > 8/5."
