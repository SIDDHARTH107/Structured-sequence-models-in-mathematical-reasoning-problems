    "message_2": "A group of order 25 has the prime factorization 25 = 5^2. According to the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in a group of order 25 must divide the index 25/5 = 5, and must be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is one Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal.\n\nLet G be a group of order 25, and let H be the unique Sylow 5-subgroup. Since H is normal, the quotient group G/H is well-defined and has order 5. Since any group of prime order is cyclic, G/H is cyclic. Let K be a subgroup of G such that G/H = G/K. Then, by the correspondence theorem, there is a bijection between the subgroups of G/H and the subgroups of G containing K.\n\nNow, let x be an element of G not in H. Then, the cyclic group generated by x, denoted by <x>, has order 5, and H ∩ <x> = {e}, where e is the identity element. Thus, the order of the product group H<x> is |H| * |<x>| = 25. Since |G| = 25, we have G = H<x>.\n\nThere are two possibilities for the structure of G:\n\n1. G is abelian: In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of H and <x>, which are both cyclic groups of order 5. This gives us the structure G ≅ C_5 × C_5, where C_n denotes the cyclic group of order n.\n\n2. G is non-abelian: In this case, G is isomorphic to the semi-direct product of H and <x>. However, since there is no non-trivial homomorphism from <x> to Aut(H) (the automorphism group of H), there is no non-abelian semi-direct product. Therefore, there is no non-abelian group of order 25.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one possible structure for a group of order 25, which is the abelian structure G ≅ C_5 × C_5. Thus, there is only one non-isomorphic group of order 25, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
