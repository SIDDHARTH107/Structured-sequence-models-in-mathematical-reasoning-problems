    "message_2": "To determine the Betti numbers of a Calabi-Yau threefold X, we can use the Hodge diamond. The Hodge diamond for a Calabi-Yau threefold is given by:\n\n```\n  1\nh11 h21\nh31 h31\nh21 h11\n  1\n```\n\nIn this case, we have h11 = h21 = 3 and h31 = 243. So the Hodge diamond for X is:\n\n```\n  1\n 3   3\n243 243\n 3   3\n  1\n```\n\nThe Betti numbers b_i are related to the Hodge numbers as follows:\n\nb0 = 1 (the top of the Hodge diamond)\nb1 = 0 (since Calabi-Yau threefolds are simply connected)\nb2 = h11 + h21 = 3 + 3 = 6\nb3 = h31 + h31 = 243 + 243 = 486\nb4 = h21 + h11 = 3 + 3 = 6\nb5 = 0 (since Calabi-Yau threefolds are simply connected)\nb6 = 1 (the bottom of the Hodge diamond)\n\nSo the Betti numbers of the Calabi-Yau threefold X are:\n\nb0 = 1\nb1 = 0\nb2 = 6\nb3 = 486\nb4 = 6\nb5 = 0\nb6 = 1"
