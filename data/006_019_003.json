    "message_1": "What is the probability of a political party winning a minimum of 4 seats in an election with 20 available seats, if the party has a 20% chance of winning each individual seat?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere P(X = k) is the probability of winning k seats, C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as nCk or \"n choose k\"), p is the probability of winning an individual seat, and n is the total number of seats.\n\nIn this case, n = 20 (total seats), p = 0.20 (20% chance of winning each seat), and we want to find the probability of winning at least 4 seats, so we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 4 to k = 20.\n\nP(X ≥ 4) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 4 to 20\n\nHowever, it's easier to calculate the complementary probability (the probability of winning 0, 1, 2, or 3 seats) and subtract it from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 4) = 1 - P(X < 4) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)]\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for k = 0, 1, 2, and 3 using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(20, 0) * 0.20^0 * 0.80^20 = 1 * 1 * 0.0115 = 0.0115\nP(X = 1) = C(20, 1) * 0.20^1 * 0.80^19 = 20 * 0.20 * 0.0144 = 0.0576\nP(X = 2) = C(20, 2) * 0.20^2 * 0.80^18 = 190 * 0.04 * 0.0180 = 0.1361\nP(X = 3) = C(20, 3) * 0.20^3 * 0.80^17 = 1140 * 0.008 * 0.0223 = 0.2030\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability:\n\nP(X < 4) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 0.0115 + 0.0576 + 0.1361 + 0.2030 = 0.4082\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of winning at least 4 seats:\n\nP(X ≥ 4) = 1 - P(X < 4) = 1 - 0.4082 = 0.5918\n\nSo, the probability of the political party winning at least 4 seats is approximately 59.18%."
