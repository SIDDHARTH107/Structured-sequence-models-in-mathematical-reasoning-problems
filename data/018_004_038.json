    "message_2": "To find the complement of a set A, we need to know the universal set U, which contains all the elements under consideration. The complement of A, denoted by A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A. Since the universal set U is not provided, we cannot find the exact complement of A.\n\nHowever, we can still prove that the complement of A is unique. Let's assume there are two different complements of A, say A' and B'. By definition, A' and B' contain all the elements in U that are not in A.\n\nNow, let's take an arbitrary element x from A'. Since x is in A', it is not in A (by the definition of complement). This means x must be in B', because B' also contains all the elements in U that are not in A. So, x is in both A' and B', which implies A' is a subset of B' (A' ⊆ B').\n\nSimilarly, let's take an arbitrary element y from B'. Since y is in B', it is not in A. This means y must be in A', because A' also contains all the elements in U that are not in A. So, y is in both A' and B', which implies B' is a subset of A' (B' ⊆ A').\n\nSince A' ⊆ B' and B' ⊆ A', we can conclude that A' = B'. This means that the complement of A is unique."
