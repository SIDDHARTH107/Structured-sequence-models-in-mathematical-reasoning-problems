    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve that is formed by successively adding smaller equilateral triangles to the sides of the previous iteration. The perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (3 * initial_length) * (4/3)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial length of the segment is 1 unit, and we want to find the perimeter after the 4th iteration. Plugging the values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = (3 * 1) * (4/3)^4\nPerimeter = 3 * (256/81)\nPerimeter = 768/81 â‰ˆ 9.4815\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake curve after the 4th iteration is approximately 9.4815 units."
