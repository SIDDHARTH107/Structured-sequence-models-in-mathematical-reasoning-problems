If you double the input size, how much longer will it take to solve the problem? Express your answer in big O notation.\n\nHint: Use the fact that O(2^(n+1)) = 2 * O(2^n).",
    "message_2": "If you double the input size, the new problem size will be 2n. Using the hint provided, we can express the new complexity as follows:\n\nO(2^(2n)) = O((2^n)^2) = 2 * O(2^n)\n\nSo, if you double the input size, it will take O(2 * 2^n) time to solve the problem."
