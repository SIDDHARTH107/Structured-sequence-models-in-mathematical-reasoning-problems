    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to calculate the arc length and add it to the two radii.\n\nFirst, let's find the arc length. The formula for the arc length (L) is:\n\nL = (θ/360) × 2πr\n\nwhere θ is the central angle in degrees, r is the radius, and π is approximately 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, θ = 60 degrees and r = 7 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nL = (60/360) × 2 × 3.14159 × 7\nL = (1/6) × 2 × 3.14159 × 7\nL ≈ 7.33038 cm\n\nNow, we need to add the two radii to the arc length to find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = L + 2r\nPerimeter = 7.33038 + 2 × 7\nPerimeter ≈ 7.33038 + 14\nPerimeter ≈ 21.33038 cm\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 21.33 cm."
