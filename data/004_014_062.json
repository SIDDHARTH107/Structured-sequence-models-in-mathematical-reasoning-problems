    "message_2": "To find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the given area about the x-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the area of infinitesimally small disks along the axis of rotation.\n\nThe area of each disk is given by the formula A(x) = π * (radius)^2, where the radius is the distance from the x-axis to the curve y = x^2. Since we are rotating about the x-axis, the radius is simply the value of the function y = x^2.\n\nSo, the area of each disk is A(x) = π * (x^2)^2 = π * x^4.\n\nNow, we need to integrate this area function along the x-axis from x = 1 to x = 3 to find the volume of the solid:\n\nV = ∫[1, 3] π * x^4 dx\n\nTo integrate, we use the power rule: ∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C\n\nV = π * [(x^5)/5] evaluated from 1 to 3\n\nV = π * [(3^5)/5 - (1^5)/5]\n\nV = π * [(243 - 1)/5]\n\nV = π * [242/5]\n\nV = 48.4π\n\nSo, the volume of the solid is 48.4π cubic units."
