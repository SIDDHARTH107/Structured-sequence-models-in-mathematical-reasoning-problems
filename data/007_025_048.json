If Alice chooses a secret integer a = 6 and sends Bob g^a (mod p), and Bob chooses a secret integer b = 9 and sends Alice g^b (mod p), what is the shared secret key that Alice and Bob can compute using their private keys and the public information they exchanged?",
    "message_2": "First, let's compute the public information that Alice and Bob exchange:\n\nAlice computes A = g^a (mod p) = 5^6 (mod 23) = 15625 (mod 23) = 8.\nSo, Alice sends A = 8 to Bob.\n\nBob computes B = g^b (mod p) = 5^9 (mod 23) = 1953125 (mod 23) = 12.\nSo, Bob sends B = 12 to Alice.\n\nNow, Alice and Bob can compute the shared secret key using their private keys and the public information they exchanged:\n\nAlice computes the shared secret key as K_A = B^a (mod p) = 12^6 (mod 23) = 2985984 (mod 23) = 2.\n\nBob computes the shared secret key as K_B = A^b (mod p) = 8^9 (mod 23) = 134217728 (mod 23) = 2.\n\nSince K_A = K_B, the shared secret key is K = 2."
