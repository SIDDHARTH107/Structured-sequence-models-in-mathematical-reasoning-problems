Determine the values of $k$ for which a nontrivial solution to the equation exists.",
    "message_2": "First, let's solve the given ordinary differential equations for $X(x)$ and $Y(y)$.\n\nFor $X(x)$:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} - k^2 X = 0$$\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\n$$r^2 - k^2 = 0$$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get $r = \\pm k$. Therefore, the general solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = A e^{kx} + B e^{-kx}$$\n\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nFor $Y(y)$:\n\n$$\\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2} + k^2 Y = 0$$\n\nThis is also a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is:\n\n$$r^2 + k^2 = 0$$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get $r = \\pm ki$. Therefore, the general solution for $Y(y)$ is:\n\n$$Y(y) = C e^{kiy} + D e^{-kiy}$$\n\nwhere $C$ and $D$ are constants.\n\nNow, let's find the general solution for $u(x, y)$:\n\n$$u(x, y) = X(x)Y(y) = (A e^{kx} + B e^{-kx})(C e^{kiy} + D e^{-kiy})$$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $k$ for which a nontrivial solution exists. To do this, we substitute the general solution for $u(x, y)$ into the given partial differential equation:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x^2} + 2i \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial x\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial^2u}{\\partial y^2} = 0$$\n\nAfter substituting and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$(-k^2 + k^2)u(x, y) = 0$$\n\nSince we are looking for nontrivial solutions, $u(x, y) \\neq 0$. Therefore, there are no restrictions on the values of $k$ for which a nontrivial solution exists.\n\nSo, the general solution for the given partial differential equation is:\n\n$$u(x, y) = (A e^{kx} + B e^{-kx})(C e^{kiy} + D e^{-kiy})$$\n\nwhere $k$ can be any constant, and $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are constants determined by boundary conditions or initial conditions."
