    "message_2": "To decrypt a Rail Fence Cipher with three rails, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the length of the ciphertext: 18 characters.\n2. Divide the length by 2 and round up to find the number of characters in the first and third rails: 18 / 2 = 9.\n3. The second rail will have the remaining characters: 18 - 9 = 9.\n4. Arrange the characters in a zigzag pattern with three rails:\n\n   E . . . I . . . E . . . X\n   . M . S . M . S . Y . A\n   . . Z . C . O . E . G . M . T . V\n\n5. Read the plaintext message along the rails: \"EXERCISESMYZAGCOMTV\".\n\nThe plaintext message is \"EXERCISESMYZAGCOMTV\"."
