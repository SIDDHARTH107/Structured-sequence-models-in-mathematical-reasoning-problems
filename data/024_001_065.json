    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the space curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the position vector r(t) with respect to time t.\n\nGiven r(t) = (2t, 3t², 5t³), let's find the first and second derivatives:\n\nr'(t) = dr(t)/dt = (2, 6t, 15t²)\nr''(t) = d²r(t)/dt² = (0, 6, 30t)\n\nNow, we need to find the tangent vector T(t) and its derivative T'(t). The tangent vector T(t) is given by the normalized first derivative of r(t):\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||\n\nAt t = 5, we have:\n\nr'(5) = (2, 30, 375)\n||r'(5)|| = √(2² + 30² + 375²) = √(4 + 900 + 140625) = √(141529) = 376\n\nT(5) = r'(5) / ||r'(5)|| = (2/376, 30/376, 375/376)\n\nNow, let's find T'(t):\n\nT'(t) = (d(2/376)/dt, d(30t/376)/dt, d(375t²/376)/dt) = (0, 30/376, 750t/376)\n\nAt t = 5, we have:\n\nT'(5) = (0, 30/376, 3750/376)\n\nNow, we can find the curvature κ(t) at t = 5:\n\nκ(t) = ||T'(t)||\nκ(5) = ||T'(5)|| = √(0² + (30/376)² + (3750/376)²) = √(0 + 0.0064 + 99.3601) = √(99.3665) ≈ 9.968\n\nThe curvature at t = 5 is approximately 9.968.\n\nNow, let's find the torsion τ(t). We need to find the binormal vector B(t) and its derivative B'(t). The binormal vector B(t) is given by the cross product of T(t) and N(t), where N(t) is the normal vector, which is given by the normalized second derivative of r(t):\n\nN(t) = r''(t) / ||r''(t)||\n\nAt t = 5, we have:\n\nr''(5) = (0, 6, 150)\n||r''(5)|| = √(0² + 6² + 150²) = √(900 + 22500) = √(23400) = 153\n\nN(5) = r''(5) / ||r''(5)|| = (0, 6/153, 150/153)\n\nNow, let's find B(t):\n\nB(t) = T(t) × N(t)\n\nAt t = 5, we have:\n\nB(5) = T(5) × N(5) = (2/376, 30/376, 375/376) × (0, 6/153, 150/153)\nB(5) = (0, -250/376, 60/376)\n\nNow, let's find B'(t):\n\nB'(t) = (dB(0)/dt, dB(-250/376)/dt, dB(60/376)/dt) = (0, 0, 0)\n\nThe torsion τ(t) is given by the dot product of N(t) and B'(t):\n\nτ(t) = N(t) • B'(t)\n\nAt t = 5, we have:\n\nτ(5) = N(5) • B'(5) = (0, 6/153, 150/153) • (0, 0, 0) = 0\n\nThe torsion at t = 5 is 0.\n\nSo, the curvature at time t = 5 is approximately 9.968, and the torsion is 0."
