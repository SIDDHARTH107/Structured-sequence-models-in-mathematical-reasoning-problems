If A and B are subsets of X, prove that int(A ∩ B) ⊆ int(A) ∩ int(B). \n\nSuppose X is a topological space with the topology T, let A and B be subsets of X. \n\nTo prove int(A ∩ B) ⊆ int(A) ∩ int(B), we start by considering any x ∈ int(A ∩ B). This means that there exists an open set U containing x such that U ⊆ A ∩ B.\n\nWe then have U ⊆ A and U ⊆ B, since A ∩ B is a subset of both A and B. Therefore, x ∈ int(A) and x ∈ int(B), which implies that x ∈ int(A) ∩ int(B).\n\nHence, int(A ∩ B) ⊆ int(A) ∩ int(B), as required.",
    "message_2": "It seems that the same question has been asked and answered multiple times. The proof provided above is correct and demonstrates that int(A ∩ B) ⊆ int(A) ∩ int(B) for any subsets A and B of a topological space X with topology T."
