    "message_2": "The Fano variety $V$ of lines on a smooth cubic 3-fold $X$ in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ is a smooth, irreducible variety of dimension 2. To find the degree of $V$, we can use the fact that the degree of the Fano variety of lines on a smooth cubic 3-fold is equal to the third Chern class of the tangent bundle of the 3-fold.\n\nFor a smooth cubic 3-fold $X \\subset \\mathbb{P}^4$, we have the following short exact sequence of sheaves:\n\n$$0 \\to \\mathcal{O}_X \\to \\mathcal{O}_X(1)^{\\oplus 5} \\to T_X \\to 0$$\n\nTaking the third exterior power of this sequence, we get:\n\n$$0 \\to \\bigwedge^3 T_X \\to \\bigwedge^3 \\mathcal{O}_X(1)^{\\oplus 5} \\to 0$$\n\nNow, we can compute the third Chern class $c_3(T_X)$ as the Euler characteristic of the sheaf $\\bigwedge^3 T_X$. Using the above short exact sequence, we have:\n\n$$c_3(T_X) = \\chi(\\bigwedge^3 T_X) = \\chi(\\bigwedge^3 \\mathcal{O}_X(1)^{\\oplus 5})$$\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, we can compute the Euler characteristic of the right-hand side:\n\n$$\\chi(\\bigwedge^3 \\mathcal{O}_X(1)^{\\oplus 5}) = \\binom{5}{3}\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X(3)) = 10\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X(3))$$\n\nNow, we can use the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem to compute the Euler characteristic of $\\mathcal{O}_X(3)$:\n\n$$\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X(3)) = \\int_X c_1(\\mathcal{O}_X(3))\\cdot c_2(T_X) = \\int_X 3H\\cdot c_2(T_X)$$\n\nHere, $H$ is the hyperplane class of $X$. Since $X$ is a smooth cubic 3-fold, we have $c_2(T_X) = 10H^2$. Thus,\n\n$$\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X(3)) = \\int_X 3H\\cdot 10H^2 = 30\\int_X H^3 = 30\\cdot 3^3 = 270$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the degree of the Fano variety $V$:\n\n$$\\deg(V) = c_3(T_X) = 10\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X(3)) = 10\\cdot 270 = 2700$$\n\nAs for the number of connected components of $V$, since $V$ is a smooth, irreducible variety, it has only one connected component."
