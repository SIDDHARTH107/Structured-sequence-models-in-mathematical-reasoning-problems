    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the ball at t = 4 seconds, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time (t). This will give us the acceleration function, a(t).\n\nThe velocity function is v(t) = 3t^2 - 2t.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative:\n\na(t) = dv(t)/dt = d(3t^2 - 2t)/dt = 6t - 2\n\nNow, we can find the acceleration at t = 4 seconds by plugging in t = 4 into the acceleration function:\n\na(4) = 6(4) - 2 = 24 - 2 = 22\n\nSo, the acceleration of the ball at t = 4 seconds is 22 m/sÂ²."
