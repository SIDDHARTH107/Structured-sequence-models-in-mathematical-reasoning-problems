    "message_2": "To find all integer solutions to the Diophantine equation 5x + 7y = 77, we can first find one particular solution and then use the general form of Diophantine equation solutions to find all other solutions.\n\nFirst, let's find one particular solution. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 7, which is 1. Since 1 divides 77, there exists a solution to the equation.\n\nNow, let's find the particular solution using the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n\n5(2) - 7(1) = 3\n7(1) - 5(1) = 2\n5(1) - 3(1) = 2\n\nNow, we can express 1 as a linear combination of 5 and 7:\n\n1 = 5(2) - 7(1) - 2(5(1) - 3(1))\n1 = 5(2) - 7(1) - 10(1) + 6(1)\n1 = 5(8) - 7(3)\n\nSo, one particular solution is (x, y) = (8, 3).\n\nNow, we can use the general form of Diophantine equation solutions to find all other solutions. The general form is:\n\nx = x0 + (b/d)n\ny = y0 - (a/d)n\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is the particular solution we found, a and b are the coefficients of the equation (5 and 7 in this case), d is the GCD of a and b (1 in this case), and n is an integer.\n\nSo, the general form for our equation is:\n\nx = 8 + 7n\ny = 3 - 5n\n\nNow, we can find all integer solutions by plugging in different values of n:\n\nn = 0: (x, y) = (8, 3)\nn = 1: (x, y) = (15, -2)\nn = -1: (x, y) = (1, 8)\n\nWe can continue to find more solutions by plugging in different values of n, but these are the main integer solutions for the Diophantine equation 5x + 7y = 77."
