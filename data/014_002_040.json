    "message_2": "To compute the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Person A and Person B agree on two public numbers: a prime number (p) and a primitive root modulo p (g). In this case, we don't have these values, so let's assume p = 23 and g = 5 (since 23 is a prime number and 5 is a primitive root modulo 23).\n\n2. Person A selects a private key (a) and calculates their public key (A) using the formula A = g^a mod p. In this case, a = 5, so A = 5^5 mod 23 = 3.\n\n3. Person B selects a private key (b) and calculates their public key (B) using the formula B = g^b mod p. In this case, b = 7, so B = 5^7 mod 23 = 2.\n\n4. Person A and Person B exchange their public keys.\n\n5. Person A calculates the shared secret key (s) using the formula s = B^a mod p. In this case, s = 2^5 mod 23 = 9.\n\n6. Person B calculates the shared secret key (s) using the formula s = A^b mod p. In this case, s = 3^7 mod 23 = 9.\n\nBoth Person A and Person B have calculated the same shared secret key (s = 9), which can be used for encryption and decryption."
