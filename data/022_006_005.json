    "message_2": "To show that $|f(z)| \\leq |z|$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we will use the maximum modulus principle. The maximum modulus principle states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) in a bounded domain and continuous on its boundary, then the maximum of the modulus of the function is attained on the boundary of the domain.\n\nFirst, we need to show that $f(z) = ze^{\\frac{1}{z}}$ is holomorphic in the domain $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The function $f(z)$ is a product of two holomorphic functions, $z$ and $e^{\\frac{1}{z}}$. The function $z$ is holomorphic everywhere in $\\mathbb{C}$, and the function $e^{\\frac{1}{z}}$ is holomorphic everywhere except at $z = 0$. Therefore, their product $f(z)$ is holomorphic in $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\nNow, let $D_r = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| \\leq r\\}$ be a closed disk centered at the origin with radius $r > 0$, and let $\\partial D_r = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z| = r\\}$ be its boundary. We want to show that the maximum of $|f(z)|$ on $D_r$ is attained on the boundary $\\partial D_r$.\n\nOn the boundary $\\partial D_r$, we have $|z| = r$. Thus, we can write $z = re^{i\\theta}$ for some $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. Then,\n\n$$|f(z)| = |re^{i\\theta}e^{\\frac{1}{re^{i\\theta}}}| = |re^{i\\theta}e^{\\frac{1}{r}e^{-i\\theta}}| = r|e^{\\frac{1}{r}e^{-i\\theta}}|.$$\n\nSince $|e^w| = e^{\\operatorname{Re}(w)}$ for any complex number $w$, we have\n\n$$|f(z)| = r|e^{\\operatorname{Re}(\\frac{1}{r}e^{-i\\theta})}| = r e^{\\frac{1}{r}\\cos\\theta}.$$\n\nNow, we want to find the maximum of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary $\\partial D_r$. Since $-1 \\leq \\cos\\theta \\leq 1$, we have\n\n$$r e^{-\\frac{1}{r}} \\leq |f(z)| \\leq r e^{\\frac{1}{r}}.$$\n\nThe maximum value of $|f(z)|$ on the boundary $\\partial D_r$ is $r e^{\\frac{1}{r}}$. However, as $r \\to 0$, we have\n\n$$\\lim_{r \\to 0} r e^{\\frac{1}{r}} = 0.$$\n\nSince $f(0) = 0$, the function $f(z)$ is continuous on the closed disk $D_r$. By the maximum modulus principle, the maximum of $|f(z)|$ on $D_r$ is attained on the boundary $\\partial D_r$. Therefore, for any $z \\in D_r$, we have\n\n$$|f(z)| \\leq r e^{\\frac{1}{r}} \\leq |z|.$$\n\nSince this holds for any $r > 0$, we conclude that $|f(z)| \\leq |z|$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$."
