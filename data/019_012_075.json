    "message_1": "Unfortunately, paraconsistent logic doesn't lend itself to numerical problems. It deals more with reasoning and contradictions within a logical system. However, here is an example of a question related to paraconsistent logic:\n\nConsider the statement \"This statement is false.\" Is this statement true or false? How does paraconsistent logic handle the contradiction?",
    "message_2": "The statement \"This statement is false\" is an example of a paradox known as the Liar Paradox. In classical logic, this statement leads to a contradiction because if it is true, then it must be false, and if it is false, then it must be true.\n\nParaconsistent logic, on the other hand, is a non-classical logic system that allows for contradictions to coexist without causing the entire system to collapse into triviality (where every statement is both true and false). In paraconsistent logic, the Liar Paradox can be handled by allowing the statement to be both true and false simultaneously, without leading to an explosion of contradictions.\n\nThis approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the statement and prevents the logical system from breaking down due to the presence of a single contradiction. It is important to note that paraconsistent logic does not eliminate contradictions but rather provides a way to manage and reason with them in a controlled manner."
