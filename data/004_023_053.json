    "message_2": "To find the area bounded by the curves y = 2x + 3 and y = x^2 - 1, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the points of intersection between the two curves.\n2. Set up the integral to find the area between the curves.\n3. Evaluate the integral.\n\nStep 1: Find the points of intersection\nTo find the points of intersection, we need to set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n2x + 3 = x^2 - 1\n\nRearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 4 = 0\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the x-values of the points of intersection:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nx = (2 ± √(2² - 4(1)(-4))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (2 ± √(20)) / 2\n\nx ≈ -0.527 and x ≈ 3.527\n\nStep 2: Set up the integral\nNow that we have the points of intersection, we can set up the integral to find the area between the curves. Since y = 2x + 3 is above y = x^2 - 1 between the points of intersection, we will subtract the lower curve from the upper curve:\n\nArea = ∫(2x + 3 - (x^2 - 1)) dx from -0.527 to 3.527\n\nArea = ∫(3 - x^2 + 2x) dx from -0.527 to 3.527\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the integral\nNow, we can evaluate the integral:\n\nArea = [3x - (1/3)x^3 + x^2] from -0.527 to 3.527\n\nArea ≈ (3(3.527) - (1/3)(3.527)^3 + (3.527)^2) - (3(-0.527) - (1/3)(-0.527)^3 + (-0.527)^2)\n\nArea ≈ 12.756\n\nSo, the area bounded by the curves y = 2x + 3 and y = x^2 - 1 is approximately 12.756 square units."
