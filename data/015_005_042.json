    "message_2": "Determining the exact maximum number of points on the Rössler system's chaotic attractor within a specific range is a complex task due to the nature of chaotic systems. However, we can try to approximate the number of points by simulating the system and counting the points that lie within the desired range.\n\nThe Rössler system is defined by the following set of differential equations:\n\ndx/dt = -y - z\ndy/dt = x + ay\ndz/dt = b + z(x - c)\n\nUsing the given parameter values (a=0.1, b=0.1, and c=14), we can simulate the system using numerical methods such as the Runge-Kutta method. After simulating the system for a sufficient amount of time and collecting a large number of data points, we can count the number of points that lie within the range of [-1,1] for each variable (x, y, and z).\n\nPlease note that this approach will only provide an approximation, as the true maximum number of points might be different due to the chaotic nature of the system. Additionally, the number of points will depend on the initial conditions and the duration of the simulation."
