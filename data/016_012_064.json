    "message_2": "The Peano curve is a space-filling curve, which means it is a continuous curve that passes through every point in a given space (in this case, a square with a side length of 1). The Peano curve is constructed through an iterative process, with each iteration increasing the length of the curve.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the Peano curve is a fractal, and its length approaches infinity as the number of iterations increases. This is because the curve becomes more and more intricate with each iteration, filling the space more completely, but also increasing its length.\n\nSo, the length of the Peano curve constructed by joining the midpoints of each line segment in a square with a side length of 1 is infinite."
