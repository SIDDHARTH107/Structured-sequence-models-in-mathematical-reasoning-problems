    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function, we first need to find the first derivative, and then differentiate it again.\n\nThe first derivative, f'(x), can be found by differentiating f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 6x + 2)\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 6\n\nNow, we need to find the second derivative, f''(x), by differentiating f'(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (12x^3 - 6x^2 + 10x - 6)\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 12x + 10\n\nNow, we can find the value of the second derivative at x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 36(2)^2 - 12(2) + 10\nf''(2) = 36(4) - 24 + 10\nf''(2) = 144 - 24 + 10\nf''(2) = 130\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function at x = 2 is 130."
