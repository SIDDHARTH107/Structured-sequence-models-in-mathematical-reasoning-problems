    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood, we can use the following formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of burglaries) / (Total population)\n\nIn this case, there have been 50 burglaries reported in the last year, and the neighborhood has a population of 10,000.\n\nProbability = 50 / 10,000 = 0.005\n\nSo, the probability of a burglary occurring in the neighborhood is 0.005 or 0.5%."
