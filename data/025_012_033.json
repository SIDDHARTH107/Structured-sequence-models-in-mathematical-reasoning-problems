Find the order of the group $E(\\mathbb{F}_{11})$, i.e., the number of points on $E(\\mathbb{F}_{11})$.",
    "message_2": "To find the order of the group $E(\\mathbb{F}_{11})$, we need to find the number of points on the elliptic curve $E$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$. We will do this by iterating through all possible values of $x$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{11}$, and for each value of $x$, we will check if there are any corresponding values of $y$ that satisfy the equation of the elliptic curve.\n\nRecall that the equation of the elliptic curve is $y^2 = x^3 + 4x + 4$. For each value of $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{11}$, we will compute the right-hand side of the equation, and then check if it is a quadratic residue modulo $11$. If it is, then there are two possible values of $y$ that satisfy the equation (unless the right-hand side is $0$, in which case there is only one possible value of $y$). We will also count the point at infinity, which is always a point on any elliptic curve.\n\nLet's go through the values of $x$ one by one:\n\n1. $x = 0$: The right-hand side is $0^3 + 4\\cdot0 + 4 = 4$. Since $4$ is a quadratic residue modulo $11$, there are two points with $x = 0$.\n2. $x = 1$: The right-hand side is $1^3 + 4\\cdot1 + 4 = 9$. Since $9$ is a quadratic residue modulo $11$, there are two points with $x = 1$.\n3. $x = 2$: The right-hand side is $2^3 + 4\\cdot2 + 4 = 24 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$. Since $2$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $11$, there are no points with $x = 2$.\n4. $x = 3$: The right-hand side is $3^3 + 4\\cdot3 + 4 = 43 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$. Since $10$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $11$, there are no points with $x = 3$.\n5. $x = 4$: The right-hand side is $4^3 + 4\\cdot4 + 4 = 80 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$. Since $3$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $11$, there are no points with $x = 4$.\n6. $x = 5$: The right-hand side is $5^3 + 4\\cdot5 + 4 = 149 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}$. Since $6$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $11$, there are no points with $x = 5$.\n7. $x = 6$: The right-hand side is $6^3 + 4\\cdot6 + 4 = 232 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. Since $1$ is a quadratic residue modulo $11$, there are two points with $x = 6$.\n8. $x = 7$: The right-hand side is $7^3 + 4\\cdot7 + 4 = 347 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}$. Since $6$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $11$, there are no points with $x = 7$.\n9. $x = 8$: The right-hand side is $8^3 + 4\\cdot8 + 4 = 528 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Since $0$ is a quadratic residue modulo $11$, there is one point with $x = 8$.\n10. $x = 9$: The right-hand side is $9^3 + 4\\cdot9 + 4 = 757 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$. Since $10$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $11$, there are no points with $x = 9$.\n11. $x = 10$: The right-hand side is $10^3 + 4\\cdot10 + 4 = 1044 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$. Since $5$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $11$, there are no points with $x = 10$.\n\nSo, we have a total of $2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7$ points with finite $x$-coordinates. Including the point at infinity, we have a total of $7 + 1 = 8$ points on $E(\\mathbb{F}_{11})$. Therefore, the order of the group $E(\\mathbb{F}_{11})$ is $\\boxed{8}$."
