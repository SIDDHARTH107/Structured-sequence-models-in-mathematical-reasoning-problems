    "message_1": "A chessboard is a square board with 8 columns and 8 rows, making 64 squares in total. In how many ways can you place identical chess pieces on the squares of a chessboard, such that no two pieces attack each other? (Assuming pieces of the same type move and attack like queens, with the ability to move vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.)",
    "message_2": "This problem is known as the Eight Queens Puzzle. The goal is to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The solution to this problem is that there are 92 distinct arrangements of the eight queens that meet the criteria.\n\nHowever, if you consider solutions that are rotations and reflections of each other as the same, then there are 12 unique solutions to the Eight Queens Puzzle."
