    "message_1": "A math student wants to compare the scores of two groups of students (Group A and Group B) on a Math test. However, the data for the two groups do not follow a normal distribution. The student decides to use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to determine if there is a significant difference in the scores of the two groups. \n\nThe student obtained the following scores:\nGroup A: [87, 91, 65, 78, 93, 85, 88, 82, 60, 76]\nGroup B: [75, 81, 68, 85, 69, 80, 72, 78, 66, 74]\n\nWhat is the rank-sum test statistic for the Wilcoxon test and what is the corresponding p-value? Can the student conclude that there is a significant difference in Math test scores between Group A and Group B?",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we first need to combine the scores from both groups and rank them in ascending order:\n\nCombined scores: [60, 65, 66, 68, 69, 72, 74, 75, 76, 78, 78, 80, 81, 82, 85, 85, 87, 88, 91, 93]\nRanks: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]\n\nNow, we assign the ranks to the original scores in each group:\n\nGroup A ranks: [17, 19, 2, 10, 20, 15, 18, 14, 1, 9]\nGroup B ranks: [8, 13, 4, 16, 5, 12, 6, 11, 3, 7]\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the ranks for each group:\n\nSum of ranks for Group A: 1 + 2 + 9 + 10 + 14 + 15 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 = 125\nSum of ranks for Group B: 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 16 = 85\n\nThe test statistic for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test is the smaller of the two rank sums, which is 85 for Group B.\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding p-value. Since the sample sizes for both groups are equal to 10, we can use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test table or a statistical software to find the p-value. Using a table or software, we find that the p-value is approximately 0.194.\n\nSince the p-value (0.194) is greater than the commonly used significance level of 0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the student cannot conclude that there is a significant difference in Math test scores between Group A and Group B based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test."
