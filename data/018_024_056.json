    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the complements of sets A and B, denoted as A' and B'. Assuming the universal set U contains all the elements in A and B, we have:\n\nU = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nA' = U - A = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {1, 2, 3} = {4}\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3, 4} = {1}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of sets A' and B', denoted as A' ∆ B':\n\nA' ∆ B' = (A' ∪ B') - (A' ∩ B') = {1, 4} - {} = {1, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets (A ∆ B) and (A' ∆ B'), denoted as (A ∆ B) ∆ (A' ∆ B'):\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ (A' ∆ B') = ({1, 4}) ∆ ({1, 4}) = {} (since the symmetric difference of a set with itself is the empty set)\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is distributive over complement. For this, we need to check if (A ∆ B) ∆ (A' ∆ B') = A' ∆ B':\n\n{} = {1, 4}\n\nThe equation is not true, so the symmetric difference of two sets is not distributive over complement."
