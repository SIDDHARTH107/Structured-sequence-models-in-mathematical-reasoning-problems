    "message_1": "In a neighborhood, it is known that the probability of a robbery occurring is 0.15 and the probability of a burglary occurring is 0.08. If the police department receives a report of an incident in the neighborhood, what is the probability that the incident is a robbery and not a burglary?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the incident is a robbery and not a burglary, we can use the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), where A is the event of a robbery and B is the event of an incident being reported.\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of an incident being reported. Since there are only two types of incidents in this neighborhood (robberies and burglaries), the probability of an incident being reported is the sum of the probabilities of a robbery and a burglary occurring:\n\nP(Incident) = P(Robbery) + P(Burglary) = 0.15 + 0.08 = 0.23\n\nNow, we want to find the probability of a robbery occurring given that an incident has been reported. Since we are looking for the probability of a robbery and not a burglary, we can assume that the probability of a burglary is 0 in this case. Therefore, the probability of a robbery and an incident being reported is the same as the probability of a robbery occurring:\n\nP(Robbery and Incident) = P(Robbery) = 0.15\n\nNow we can use the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(Robbery|Incident) = P(Robbery and Incident) / P(Incident) = 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.6522\n\nSo, the probability that the incident is a robbery and not a burglary is approximately 0.6522 or 65.22%."
