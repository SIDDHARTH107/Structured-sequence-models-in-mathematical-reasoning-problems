    "message_1": "A salesperson needs to visit 5 cities (A, B, C, D, and E) in the most efficient way possible, where each city is connected to the other four cities. The distance between A and B is 3, between A and C is 4, between A and D is 5, between A and E is 2, between B and C is 2, between B and D is 3, between B and E is 6, between C and D is 4, between C and E is 3, and between D and E is 1. What is the shortest possible route that the salesperson could travel to visit all 5 cities exactly once and return to the starting city?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method by listing all possible permutations of the cities and calculating the total distance for each permutation. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) or 120 possible permutations. However, since the route is a cycle and the starting city doesn't matter, we can divide the number of permutations by 5, resulting in 24 unique routes to consider. Here are the routes and their total distances:\n\n1. A-B-C-D-E-A: 3+2+4+1+2 = 12\n2. A-B-C-E-D-A: 3+2+3+1+5 = 14\n3. A-B-D-C-E-A: 3+3+4+3+2 = 15\n4. A-B-D-E-C-A: 3+3+1+3+4 = 14\n5. A-B-E-C-D-A: 3+6+3+4+5 = 21\n6. A-B-E-D-C-A: 3+6+1+4+2 = 16\n\n7. A-C-B-D-E-A: 4+2+3+1+2 = 12\n8. A-C-B-E-D-A: 4+2+6+1+5 = 18\n9. A-C-D-B-E-A: 4+4+3+6+2 = 19\n10. A-C-D-E-B-A: 4+4+1+2+3 = 14\n11. A-C-E-B-D-A: 4+3+6+3+5 = 21\n12. A-C-E-D-B-A: 4+3+1+5+2 = 15\n\n13. A-D-B-C-E-A: 5+3+2+3+2 = 15\n14. A-D-B-E-C-A: 5+3+6+3+4 = 21\n15. A-D-C-B-E-A: 5+4+2+6+2 = 19\n16. A-D-C-E-B-A: 5+4+3+2+3 = 17\n17. A-D-E-B-C-A: 5+1+6+2+4 = 18\n18. A-D-E-C-B-A: 5+1+3+4+2 = 15\n\n19. A-E-B-C-D-A: 2+3+2+4+5 = 16\n20. A-E-B-D-C-A: 2+3+3+4+4 = 16\n21. A-E-C-B-D-A: 2+3+2+3+5 = 15\n22. A-E-C-D-B-A: 2+3+4+3+3 = 15\n23.
