    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least 3 heads when flipping a fair coin 5 times, we can calculate the probabilities of getting exactly 3, 4, or 5 heads and then add those probabilities together.\n\n1. Probability of getting exactly 3 heads:\nThere are 5C3 (5 choose 3) ways to get 3 heads in 5 flips, which is equal to 10. The probability of each of these combinations occurring is (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^2 = 1/32. So, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads is 10 * 1/32 = 10/32.\n\n2. Probability of getting exactly 4 heads:\nThere are 5C4 (5 choose 4) ways to get 4 heads in 5 flips, which is equal to 5. The probability of each of these combinations occurring is (1/2)^4 * (1/2)^1 = 1/32. So, the probability of getting exactly 4 heads is 5 * 1/32 = 5/32.\n\n3. Probability of getting exactly 5 heads:\nThere is only 1 way to get 5 heads in 5 flips (HHHHH). The probability of this occurring is (1/2)^5 = 1/32.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of getting exactly 3, 4, or 5 heads together:\n\n10/32 + 5/32 + 1/32 = 16/32\n\nThe probability of getting at least 3 heads when flipping a fair coin 5 times is 16/32, which simplifies to 1/2 or 50%."
