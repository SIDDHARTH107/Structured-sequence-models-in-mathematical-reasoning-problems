    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2$, we first need to find its first derivative and set it equal to zero.\n\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2) = 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x$\n\nNow, we set $f'(x) = 0$:\n\n$4x^3 - 12x^2 + 12x = 0$\n\nWe can factor out a $4x$:\n\n$4x(x^2 - 3x + 3) = 0$\n\nSo, we have two factors: $4x$ and $(x^2 - 3x + 3)$. The first factor gives us a critical point at $x = 0$. To find the critical points from the second factor, we need to solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 3x + 3 = 0$. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nHere, $a = 1$, $b = -3$, and $c = 3$. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(3)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 12}}{2}$\n\n$x = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for the second factor. Therefore, the only critical point is $x = 0$.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether this critical point is a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point using Morse theory. To do this, we need to find the second derivative of $f(x)$:\n\n$f''(x) = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2) = 12x^2 - 24x + 12$\n\nNow, we evaluate the second derivative at the critical point $x = 0$:\n\n$f''(0) = 12(0)^2 - 24(0) + 12 = 12$\n\nSince $f''(0) > 0$, the critical point at $x = 0$ is a local minimum according to Morse theory.\n\nIn conclusion, the function $f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2$ has one critical point at $x = 0$, and it is a local minimum."
