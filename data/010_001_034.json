    "message_2": "Let the open sets in X be {∅, A, X} and the open sets in Y be {∅, B, C, Y}. We will find the open sets in the product space X×Y using the definition of the product topology.\n\nRecall that the basis for the product topology on X×Y is given by the set of all products of the form U×V, where U is an open set in X and V is an open set in Y. We will find all possible products of this form and then determine the open sets in X×Y.\n\nWe have the following products of open sets:\n\n1. ∅×∅ = ∅\n2. ∅×B = ∅\n3. ∅×C = ∅\n4. ∅×Y = ∅\n5. A×∅ = ∅\n6. A×B\n7. A×C\n8. A×Y\n9. X×∅ = ∅\n10. X×B\n11. X×C\n12. X×Y\n\nNow, we need to find the union of these sets to get the open sets in X×Y. Note that the empty set ∅ is always an open set in any topology. We also have the entire set X×Y as an open set. The other open sets are A×B, A×C, A×Y, X×B, and X×C.\n\nThus, the smallest possible number of open sets in X×Y is 7."
