    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. There are 12 spaces on the wheel, and we need to choose 3 winning spaces. We can do this in C(12,3) ways, where C(n,k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. C(12,3) = 12! / (3! * (12-3)!) = 220.\n\n2. Now, we need to arrange these 3 winning spaces such that they occur exactly once. To do this, we can think of the 3 winning spaces as a single group and the remaining 9 non-winning spaces as another group. We need to arrange these two groups in a circular manner.\n\n3. In a circular arrangement, there are (n-1)! ways to arrange n items. So, we have (2-1)! = 1 way to arrange the two groups.\n\n4. Within the group of 3 winning spaces, there are 3! ways to arrange them. Similarly, within the group of 9 non-winning spaces, there are 9! ways to arrange them.\n\n5. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 12 spaces such that every three winning spaces occur exactly once is:\n\n220 (ways to choose 3 winning spaces) * 1 (way to arrange the two groups) * 3! (ways to arrange the winning spaces within their group) * 9! (ways to arrange the non-winning spaces within their group)\n\n= 220 * 1 * 6 * 362880\n\n= 479001600\n\nSo, there are 479,001,600 different designs that the company can create for the promotional lottery wheel."
