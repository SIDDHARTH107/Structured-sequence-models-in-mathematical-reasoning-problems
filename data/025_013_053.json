    "message_2": "1. To compute the discriminant of the Weierstrass equation, we use the formula:\n$$\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the $x$ and constant terms, respectively. In this case, $a = 2$ and $b = 2$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$$\\Delta = -16(4(2)^3 + 27(2)^2) = -16(32 + 108) = -16(140) = -2240$$\nSo the discriminant of the Weierstrass equation is $\\Delta = -2240$.\n\n2. To find the coordinates of all the points on the curve with $x$-coordinate equal to $0$, we substitute $x = 0$ into the equation:\n$$y^2 = (0)^3 + 2(0) + 2 = 2$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get two possible values for $y$: $y = \\sqrt{2}$ and $y = -\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the points on the curve with $x$-coordinate equal to $0$ are $(0, \\sqrt{2})$ and $(0, -\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n3. To find the slope of the line through points $P = (1, -\\sqrt{3})$ and $Q = (2, 2\\sqrt{2})$, we use the formula for the slope between two points:\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$\nPlugging in the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$, we get:\n$$m = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2} - (-\\sqrt{3})}{2 - 1} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}}{1} = 2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$$\nSo the slope of the line through $P$ and $Q$ is $m = 2\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$."
