    "message_2": "To find the length of a diagonal of one of the faces of a regular tetrahedron, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. A face of a regular tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle. Let's consider one of these equilateral triangles and draw a diagonal. This diagonal divides the equilateral triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the side lengths is 1:âˆš3:2. Since the edge length of the tetrahedron is 4 cm, the length of the shorter leg (opposite the 30-degree angle) in the 30-60-90 triangle is half of the edge length, which is 2 cm. \n\nNow we can use the ratio to find the length of the diagonal (the hypotenuse of the 30-60-90 triangle). Since the ratio of the hypotenuse to the shorter leg is 2:1, the length of the diagonal is twice the length of the shorter leg:\n\nDiagonal length = 2 * 2 cm = 4 cm."
