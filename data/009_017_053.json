    "message_2": "To find the magnetic flux density at the center of the loop, we can use the equation B = μ₀I/2r, where B is the magnetic flux density, μ₀ is the permeability of free space, I is the current, and r is the radius of the loop.\n\nThe permeability of free space, μ₀, is a constant value of 4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A (tesla meters per ampere).\n\nGiven the current I = 3 A and the radius r = 0.2 meters, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A) × (3 A) / (2 × 0.2 m)\n\nB = (4π × 10^(-7) T·m/A) × (3 A) / (0.4 m)\n\nB = (12π × 10^(-7) T·m) / (0.4 m)\n\nB ≈ (37.68 × 10^(-7) T) / (0.4 m)\n\nB ≈ 94.2 × 10^(-7) T\n\nB ≈ 9.42 × 10^(-6) T\n\nThe magnetic flux density at the center of the loop is approximately 9.42 × 10^(-6) tesla."
