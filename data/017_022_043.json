Determine if G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. If G is isomorphic to one of these groups, state which one and provide a brief explanation for your answer. If G is not isomorphic to any of these groups, explain why not.",
    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60, we can use the Sylow theorems.\n\nFirst, let's consider the Sylow p-subgroups of G. The order of G is 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (n_5) must divide 12 and be congruent to 1 mod 5. The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 6. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 20 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so the possible values for n_3 are 1 and 10. Finally, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 15 and be congruent to 1 mod 2, so the possible values for n_2 are 1, 3, and 15.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If n_5 = n_3 = n_2 = 1, then G has unique Sylow 5, 3, and 2-subgroups, which are all normal. In this case, G is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, and G is isomorphic to C_4 × C_3 × C_5, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C60.\n\n2. If n_5 = 6 and n_3 = 10, then G has 6 Sylow 5-subgroups and 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G cannot be abelian, since an abelian group of order 60 must have a unique Sylow 5-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. Therefore, G must be one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60.\n\n3. If G is isomorphic to the alternating group A5 × C2, then G has a normal subgroup of order 5 (A5). In this case, n_5 = 6, and G has 6 Sylow 5-subgroups. Moreover, G has a normal subgroup of order 2 (C2), so n_2 = 1. The structure of G in this case is different from the structures in cases 1 and 2.\n\nIn conclusion, G can be isomorphic to the cyclic group C60, the alternating group A5 × C2, or one of the 32 non-abelian groups of order 60. To determine which one, we need more information about the structure of G, such as the number of its Sylow p-subgroups."
