    "message_2": "To find the volume of a hyperbolic tetrahedron, we can use the Lobachevsky function. However, we need more information about the tetrahedron, specifically the dihedral angles. Since we only have the edge lengths, we cannot uniquely determine the volume of the hyperbolic tetrahedron.\n\nIf you can provide the dihedral angles or more information about the tetrahedron, I can help you find the volume."
