    "message_1": "Suppose you are running a bakery and need to price your cakes. The cost of producing one cake is $10, and you want to make a profit of $30 per dozen cakes. Write a mathematical expression for the price of each cake and determine the optimal price to charge for the cakes.",
    "message_2": "Let P be the price of each cake. Since you want to make a profit of $30 per dozen cakes, we can set up the following equation:\n\n12(P - 10) = 30\n\nHere, 12 represents the number of cakes in a dozen, P - 10 represents the profit per cake (price minus cost), and 30 is the desired total profit per dozen cakes.\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n\n12(P - 10) = 30\n12P - 120 = 30\n12P = 150\nP = 150 / 12\nP = 12.5\n\nSo, the optimal price to charge for each cake is $12.50."
