    "message_2": "To find the probability that at least 2 cities will be hit by a hurricane this year, we can first find the probability that none or only one city will be hit, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's find the probability that no city will be hit by a hurricane:\nThe probability of a city not being hit by a hurricane is 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.\nSince there are 50 cities, the probability that none of them will be hit is (0.96)^50 ≈ 0.1296.\n\nNow let's find the probability that exactly one city will be hit by a hurricane:\nThere are 50 cities, and the probability of a city being hit is 0.04, while the probability of a city not being hit is 0.96. We can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nIn this case, n = 50 (number of cities), k = 1 (exactly one city hit), p = 0.04 (probability of a city being hit), and (1-p) = 0.96 (probability of a city not being hit).\n\nP(X = 1) = (50 choose 1) * (0.04)^1 * (0.96)^49\nP(X = 1) = 50 * 0.04 * (0.96)^49 ≈ 0.3717\n\nNow we can find the probability that at least 2 cities will be hit by a hurricane:\nP(at least 2 cities) = 1 - P(none) - P(exactly one)\nP(at least 2 cities) = 1 - 0.1296 - 0.3717\nP(at least 2 cities) ≈ 0.4987\n\nSo, the probability that at least 2 cities will be hit by a hurricane this year is approximately 0.4987 or 49.87%."
