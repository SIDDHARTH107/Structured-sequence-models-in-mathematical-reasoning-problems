    "message_1": "In a manufacturing company, 5% of the produced units are defective. A sample of 200 units is selected randomly. What is the probability that less than 10 units in the sample are defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the sample size of 200 units)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, the number of defective units)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a unit being defective, which is 5% or 0.05)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of a unit not being defective, which is 95% or 0.95)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nWe want to find the probability that less than 10 units in the sample are defective, which means we need to find the probability for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 and then sum these probabilities.\n\nP(X < 10) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9)\n\nWe can calculate each probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 0) = (200C0) * (0.05^0) * (0.95^200)\nP(X = 1) = (200C1) * (0.05^1) * (0.95^199)\n...\nP(X = 9) = (200C9) * (0.05^9) * (0.95^191)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities and sum them up:\n\nP(X < 10) ≈ 0.0004 + 0.0033 + 0.0122 + 0.0299 + 0.0542 + 0.0756 + 0.0847 + 0.0789 + 0.0611 + 0.0404 ≈ 0.4417\n\nSo, the probability that less than 10 units in the sample are defective is approximately 0.4417 or 44.17%."
