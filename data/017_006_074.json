    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 35. Since 35 = 5 * 7, and 5 and 7 are prime numbers, we can apply Sylow's Theorems to analyze the structure of G.\n\nBy Sylow's First Theorem, G has a Sylow 5-subgroup and a Sylow 7-subgroup. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 7-subgroup. Then, |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7.\n\nBy Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, divides 7 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is n_5 = 1. Similarly, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is n_7 = 1.\n\nSince n_5 = n_7 = 1, there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup and one Sylow 7-subgroup in G. Let P and Q be these unique subgroups. Since they are unique, they must be normal in G (by Sylow's Second Theorem).\n\nNow, consider the elements of P and Q. Since |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in P is either 1 or 5, and the order of any element in Q is either 1 or 7. The identity element e is the only element of order 1 in both P and Q.\n\nLet p be an element of order 5 in P, and q be an element of order 7 in Q. Then, p^5 = e and q^7 = e. Since P and Q are normal in G, we can form the set {pq : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. We will show that this set forms a subgroup of G.\n\nLet x = p_1q_1 and y = p_2q_2 be elements in this set, where p_1, p_2 ∈ P and q_1, q_2 ∈ Q. Then, xy = p_1q_1p_2q_2. Since Q is normal in G, there exists an element q_3 ∈ Q such that q_1p_2 = p_2q_3. Thus, xy = p_1p_2q_3q_2, which is an element of the set {pq : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q} since p_1p_2 ∈ P and q_3q_2 ∈ Q. Therefore, this set is closed under the group operation.\n\nThe identity element e is in this set since e = ee, where e is the identity in both P and Q. Let x = pq be an element in this set. Then, the inverse of x is x^(-1) = (pq)^(-1) = q^(-1)p^(-1), where p^(-1) ∈ P and q^(-1) ∈ Q. Since P and Q are normal, there exists an element q_4 ∈ Q such that p^(-1)q^(-1) = q_4p^(-1). Thus, x^(-1) = q_4p^(-1), which is an element of the set {pq : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. Therefore, this set contains inverses for all its elements.\n\nHence, the set {pq : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q} forms a subgroup of G. Since |P| = 5 and |Q| = 7, and 5 and 7 are relatively prime, the size of this subgroup is |P||Q| = 35, which is the order of G. Therefore, this subgroup is equal to G.\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\n1. G is cyclic: In this case, G has an element of order 35, and we are done.\n\n2. G is not cyclic: In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, which are cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, respectively. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7.\n\nIn conclusion, if G is a group of order 35, it is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7."
