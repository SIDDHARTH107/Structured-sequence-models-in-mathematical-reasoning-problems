    "message_2": "To find the holomorphic differential forms on the curve, we first need to find the differentials of the coordinates. Let the curve be defined by the equation $F(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - 2x - 3 = 0$. Then, we have the following total differential:\n\n$$dF = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} dy = 0.$$\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$$(-3x^2 - 2) dx + 2y dy = 0.$$\n\nNow, we can express $dy$ in terms of $dx$:\n\n$$dy = \\frac{3x^2 + 2}{2y} dx.$$\n\nWe are looking for holomorphic differential forms invariant under the involution $(x, y) \\mapsto (-x, y)$. Let $\\omega = f(x, y) dx$ be such a differential form. Under the involution, we have:\n\n$$\\omega(-x, y) = f(-x, y) dx = f(x, y) (-dx) = -\\omega(x, y).$$\n\nSince $\\omega$ is invariant under the involution, we must have $\\omega(-x, y) = \\omega(x, y)$, which implies that $f(-x, y) = -f(x, y)$. This means that $f(x, y)$ is an odd function of $x$.\n\nNow, we can write $f(x, y)$ as a power series in $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$f(x, y) = \\sum_{n, m} a_{n, m} x^n y^m.$$\n\nSince $f(x, y)$ is odd in $x$, we have $a_{n, m} = 0$ for even $n$. Thus, we can write $f(x, y)$ as a sum of odd powers of $x$:\n\n$$f(x, y) = \\sum_{n, m} a_{2n+1, m} x^{2n+1} y^m.$$\n\nNow, we need to find a basis for the vector space of such functions. We can start by considering the lowest-degree terms. The lowest-degree term in $x$ is $x$, and the lowest-degree term in $y$ is $y^2$. Thus, the lowest-degree term in $f(x, y)$ is $xy^2$. \n\nSince the curve is defined by the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 3$, we can substitute this expression for $y^2$ in the differential form:\n\n$$\\omega = f(x, y) dx = a(xy^2) dx = a(x(x^3 + 2x + 3)) dx = ax(x^3 + 2x + 3) dx.$$\n\nThis differential form is holomorphic on the curve and invariant under the involution $(x, y) \\mapsto (-x, y)$. Moreover, it is non-zero, so it forms a basis for the vector space of holomorphic differential forms on the curve which are invariant under the involution. Thus, the basis is given by:\n\n$$\\{x(x^3 + 2x + 3) dx\\}.$$"
