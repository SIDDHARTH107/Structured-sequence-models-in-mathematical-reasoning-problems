    "message_2": "To solve the given system of equations using inverse matrices, we first need to write the system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x and y), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  3 |\n    | 4  5 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 5  |\n    | 11 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of matrix A. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix is given by the formula:\n\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n\nwhere det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nFirst, let's find the determinant of A:\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 5) - (3 * 4) = 10 - 12 = -2\n\nNow, let's find the adjugate of A:\n\nadj(A) = |  5  -3 |\n         | -4   2 |\n\nNow, we can find the inverse of A:\n\nA^(-1) = (-1/2) * adj(A) = | -5/2  3/2 |\n                            |  2   -1  |\n\nNow, we can find the solution X by multiplying A^(-1) with B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B = | -5/2  3/2 | * | 5  | = | x |\n                 |  2   -1  |   | 11 |   | y |\n\nMultiplying the matrices:\n\nx = (-5/2) * 5 + (3/2) * 11 = -25/2 + 33/2 = 8/2 = 4\ny = 2 * 5 - 1 * 11 = 10 - 11 = -1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is x = 4 and y = -1."
