    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to find the coefficients a_n and b_n for the following representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the sum is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nSince the function is odd (f(-x) = -f(x)), all the a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nTo find b_n, we use the following formula:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(n * x)] dx, where the integral is taken over one period.\n\nFor n > 0, we have:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫(-1 * sin(n * x) dx) from -π to 0 + ∫(1 * sin(n * x) dx) from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n * cos(n * x)) from -π to 0 + (-1/n * cos(n * x)) from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n * (cos(0) - cos(-n * π))) + (-1/n * (cos(n * π) - cos(0)))]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n * (1 - cos(-n * π))) + (-1/n * (cos(n * π) - 1))]\n\nFor odd n, cos(n * π) = -1, and for even n, cos(n * π) = 1. Since the function is odd, the even terms will be zero. So, we only need to consider odd n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1/n * (1 - (-1))) + (-1/n * (-1 - 1))]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * (2/n) * 2\n\nb_n = (4/π) * (1/n) for odd n\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series using the first 3 non-zero terms:\n\nf(x) ≈ (4/π) * [(1/1) * sin(x) + (1/3) * sin(3 * x) + (1/5) * sin(5 * x)]\n\nTo plot the function, you can use any graphing software or calculator and input the above equation for f(x). The plot will show an approximation of the original function using the first 3 non-zero terms of the Fourier series."
