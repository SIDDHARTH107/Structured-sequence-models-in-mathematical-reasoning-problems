    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for connected planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nWe are given V = 9 and E = 12. We need to find F to calculate the genus g.\n\nSince the graph is connected, we can use the inequality for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nIn our case, 12 ≤ 3 * 9 - 6, which simplifies to 12 ≤ 21. This inequality holds true, so the graph could potentially be planar. However, we need to find the number of faces to be sure.\n\nWe can rearrange Euler's formula to find F:\n\nF = 2 - 2g + E - V\n\nIf the graph is planar (g = 0), then:\n\nF = 2 - 2 * 0 + 12 - 9\nF = 2 + 3\nF = 5\n\nNow, let's check if the graph satisfies the inequality for planar graphs with the calculated number of faces:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n12 ≤ 3 * 9 - 6\n12 ≤ 21\n\nThe inequality holds true, so the graph is indeed planar, and its genus is g = 0."
