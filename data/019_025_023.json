    "message_1": "Suppose a company has invested in two types of advertisement campaign - TV commercials and social media ads. The company conducted a study to determine the impact of each type of advertisement on their overall sales. The results showed that when they ran a TV commercial, their sales increased by 10%, whereas when they ran a social media ad, their sales increased by 15%. If the company's overall sales increased by 12%, determine what proportion of the increase can be attributed to the TV commercial campaign.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the proportion of the sales increase attributed to the TV commercial campaign, and y be the proportion of the sales increase attributed to the social media ad campaign. Since the overall sales increase is 12%, we have:\n\nx + y = 1 (since the proportions must add up to 100%)\n\nNow, we know that the TV commercial campaign increased sales by 10% and the social media ad campaign increased sales by 15%. So, we can write the equation:\n\n10x + 15y = 12\n\nWe already have the equation x + y = 1. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nFirst, we can solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 1 - y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n10(1 - y) + 15y = 12\n\nSimplify and solve for y:\n\n10 - 10y + 15y = 12\n5y = 2\ny = 2/5\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 1 - (2/5)\nx = 3/5\n\nSo, the proportion of the sales increase attributed to the TV commercial campaign is 3/5 or 60%."
