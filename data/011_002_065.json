    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations. A combination is a selection of items from a larger set, where the order of the items does not matter.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of ways to choose a committee of 5 students from the group of 12 students. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students, r is the number of students to be chosen, and ! denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose a committee of 5 students from 12 students:\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!(12-5)!)\n= 12! / (5!7!)\n= (12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n= 792\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 freshmen, 2 sophomores, and 1 junior. We will calculate this separately for each class and then multiply the results together.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 freshmen from 3:\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!)\n= 3! / (2!1!)\n= (3 × 2) / (2 × 1)\n= 3\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 sophomores from 5:\n\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\n= 5! / (2!3!)\n= (5 × 4) / (2 × 1)\n= 10\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 junior from 4:\n\nC(4, 1) = 4! / (1!(4-1)!)\n= 4! / (1!3!)\n= (4) / (1)\n= 4\n\nNow, multiply the results together:\n\n3 (ways to choose freshmen) × 10 (ways to choose sophomores) × 4 (ways to choose juniors) = 120\n\nFinally, we will find the probability by dividing the number of ways to choose the desired committee by the total number of ways to choose a committee:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose desired committee) / (Total number of ways to choose a committee)\n= 120 / 792\n= 5 / 33\n\nSo, the probability that 2 freshmen, 2 sophomores, and 1 junior will be selected for the committee is 5/33."
