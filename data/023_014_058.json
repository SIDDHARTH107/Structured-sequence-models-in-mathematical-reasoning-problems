    "message_2": "To determine the normalized wave function of a particle with a momentum of 4 units and a position uncertainty of 2 units, we will use the Fourier transform. The wave function in the momentum space can be represented as a Gaussian function:\n\nΨ(p) = (α/π)^(1/4) * exp(-α(p - p0)^2 / 2)\n\nwhere α is a constant, p is the momentum, and p0 is the average momentum of the particle. In this case, p0 = 4 units.\n\nThe position uncertainty, Δx, is related to the momentum uncertainty, Δp, by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant. We are given Δx = 2 units, so we can find Δp:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx) = ħ / 4\n\nNow, we can relate the momentum uncertainty to the Gaussian function:\n\nΔp = (2 * ħ^2 * α)^(1/2)\n\nSolving for α:\n\nα = Δp^2 / (2 * ħ^2) = (ħ / 4)^2 / (2 * ħ^2) = 1 / (32 * ħ)\n\nNow we have the wave function in momentum space:\n\nΨ(p) = ((1 / (32 * ħ * π))^(1/4) * exp(-(1 / (32 * ħ)) * (p - 4)^2 / 2)\n\nTo find the wave function in position space, we use the Fourier transform:\n\nΨ(x) = (1 / (2 * π * ħ))^(1/2) * ∫ Ψ(p) * exp(-ipx/ħ) dp\n\nPlugging in the expression for Ψ(p):\n\nΨ(x) = (1 / (2 * π * ħ))^(1/2) * ∫ ((1 / (32 * ħ * π))^(1/4) * exp(-(1 / (32 * ħ)) * (p - 4)^2 / 2) * exp(-ipx/ħ) dp\n\nThis integral can be solved analytically, and the result is:\n\nΨ(x) = (1 / (4 * π))^(1/4) * exp(-x^2 / 8) * exp(2ix)\n\nThis is the normalized wave function of the particle in position space."
