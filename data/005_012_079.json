The mean age of these 50 students was found to be 15 years with a standard deviation of 2 years. Find the 95% confidence interval for the average age of all the students in the school.",
    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the average age of all the students in the school, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nwhere the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table) and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = Standard Deviation / √(Sample Size)\n\nGiven the mean age of the 50 students is 15 years, the standard deviation is 2 years, and the sample size is 50 students, we can calculate the standard error:\n\nStandard Error = 2 / √50 ≈ 0.283\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 15 ± (1.96 * 0.283)\nConfidence Interval = 15 ± 0.555\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the average age of all the students in the school is approximately 14.445 to 15.555 years."
