    "message_2": "To determine if X is connected, we need to check if there are any non-empty, disjoint open sets that cover X. If such sets exist, then X is not connected. Otherwise, X is connected.\n\nLet's consider the open sets A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}. We can see that A and B are disjoint (A ∩ B = ∅) and their union covers X (A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4} = X).\n\nNow, let's check if A and B are open in the given topology. The basis elements for the topology are:\n\n{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (1,4)}\n\nWe can express A and B as unions of basis elements:\n\nA = (1,2) ∪ (1,3) ∩ (2,3) = {1, 2}\nB = (3,4) ∪ (2,4) ∩ (1,4) = {3, 4}\n\nSince A and B can be expressed as unions of basis elements, they are open sets in the given topology.\n\nSince we have found non-empty, disjoint open sets A and B that cover X, the topological space X is not connected."
