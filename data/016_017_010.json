    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The total length of the curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial segment length * 2^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1, and we want to find the total length after 6 iterations. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nLength = 1 * 2^6\n\nLength = 1 * 64\n\nLength = 64\n\nSo, the total length of the Heighway dragon curve after 6 iterations is 64."
