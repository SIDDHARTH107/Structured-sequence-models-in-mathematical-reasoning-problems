    "message_2": "First, let's compute the polynomial $f(tx, ty, tz)$. We have:\n\n$f(tx, ty, tz) = (tx)^2(ty) + 2(tx)(ty)(tz) + (tz)^3 = t^3x^2y + 2t^3xyz + t^3z^3 = t^3(x^2y + 2xyz + z^3) = t^3f(x, y, z)$.\n\nNow, we want to find all values of $t$ such that $f(tx, ty, tz)$ has a nontrivial invariant. A nontrivial invariant means that there exists a non-zero polynomial $g(x, y, z)$ such that $f(tx, ty, tz) = g(x, y, z)$ for all $(x, y, z)$.\n\nSince $f(tx, ty, tz) = t^3f(x, y, z)$, we have $g(x, y, z) = t^3f(x, y, z)$. Thus, we want to find all values of $t$ such that $t^3f(x, y, z)$ is a nontrivial invariant.\n\nNotice that if $t = 1$, then $g(x, y, z) = f(x, y, z)$, which is a nontrivial invariant. However, if $t \\neq 1$, then $t^3 \\neq 1$, and $g(x, y, z) = t^3f(x, y, z)$ is not a nontrivial invariant since it is just a scalar multiple of $f(x, y, z)$.\n\nTherefore, the only value of $t$ such that $f(tx, ty, tz)$ has a nontrivial invariant is $t = 1$."
