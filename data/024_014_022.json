    "message_2": "To compute the Lie derivative of vector field V with respect to vector field U, we need to evaluate the Lie bracket [U, V]. The Lie bracket is given by the following formula:\n\n[U, V] = (U(∂/∂x)V - V(∂/∂x)U, U(∂/∂y)V - V(∂/∂y)U)\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives of U and V:\n\nU = (-y, x)\nV = (x^2 + y^2, 2xy)\n\n∂U/∂x = (0, 1)\n∂U/∂y = (-1, 0)\n∂V/∂x = (2x, 2y)\n∂V/∂y = (2y, 2x)\n\nNow, let's compute the Lie bracket [U, V]:\n\n[U, V] = (U(∂/∂x)V - V(∂/∂x)U, U(∂/∂y)V - V(∂/∂y)U)\n       = ((-y, x)(2x, 2y) - (x^2 + y^2)(0, 1), (-y, x)(2y, 2x) - (x^2 + y^2)(-1, 0))\n       = ((-2xy, 2x^2) - (0, x^2 + y^2), (2y^2, 2xy) - (-y^2 - x^2, 0))\n       = ((-2xy, 2x^2 - x^2 - y^2), (2y^2 + y^2 + x^2, 2xy))\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the Lie derivative at the point (1, -1):\n\n[U, V](1, -1) = ((-2(1)(-1), 2(1)^2 - (1)^2 - (-1)^2), (2(-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + (1)^2, 2(1)(-1)))\n              = ((2, 2 - 1 - 1), (2 + 1 + 1, -2))\n              = ((2, 0), (4, -2))\n\nSo, the Lie derivative of V with respect to U at point (1, -1) is ((2, 0), (4, -2))."
