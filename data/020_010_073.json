    "message_1": "A manufacturing plant produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The plant can produce up to 500 units of either product per day. The profit for selling one unit of Product A is $10, while the profit for selling one unit of Product B is $15. Due to uncertainty in demand, the plant owner wants to ensure that the profit earned every day is at least $4000. What is the minimum number of units of each product that should be produced to achieve the goal of earning at least $4000 per day, considering the uncertain demand scenarios?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B. The plant owner wants to earn at least $4000 per day, so the profit equation can be written as:\n\n10x + 15y ≥ 4000\n\nThe plant can produce up to 500 units of either product per day, so we have the constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\nx + y ≤ 500\n\nWe want to find the minimum number of units of each product that should be produced to achieve the goal of earning at least $4000 per day.\n\nFirst, we can try to minimize the number of Product A units produced (x). If we produce 0 units of Product A, we can find the minimum number of Product B units needed:\n\n10(0) + 15y ≥ 4000\n15y ≥ 4000\ny ≥ 4000/15\ny ≥ 266.67\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a unit, we need to produce at least 267 units of Product B.\n\nNow, let's try to minimize the number of Product B units produced (y). If we produce 0 units of Product B, we can find the minimum number of Product A units needed:\n\n10x + 15(0) ≥ 4000\n10x ≥ 4000\nx ≥ 400\n\nHowever, producing 400 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B does not satisfy the constraint x + y ≤ 500. Therefore, we need to find a combination of Product A and Product B units that satisfy both the profit equation and the constraint.\n\nLet's try producing 233 units of Product A:\n\n10(233) + 15y ≥ 4000\n2330 + 15y ≥ 4000\n15y ≥ 1670\ny ≥ 111.33\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a unit, we need to produce at least 112 units of Product B. This combination satisfies the constraint:\n\n233 + 112 = 345 ≤ 500\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of units of each product that should be produced to achieve the goal of earning at least $4000 per day is 233 units of Product A and 112 units of Product B."
