    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to send a signed message to Bob using the ElGamal digital signature scheme. The prime modulus is p = 17, the primitive root is g = 3, and Alice's secret key is a = 2. Suppose the message hash is h = 8 and Bob verifies the signature using Alice's public key (p=17, g=3, y=15). What is the value of s (the signature)?",
    "message_2": "To compute the ElGamal digital signature, we need to find the values of r and s. We are given the following parameters:\n\np = 17 (prime modulus)\ng = 3 (primitive root)\na = 2 (Alice's secret key)\nh = 8 (message hash)\ny = 15 (Alice's public key)\n\nFirst, let's compute the value of r. We can do this using the formula:\n\nr ≡ g^k mod p\n\nWe need to choose a random integer k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ p-2. Let's choose k = 4 (you can choose any other value in the given range).\n\nNow, we can compute r:\n\nr ≡ 3^4 mod 17\nr ≡ 81 mod 17\nr ≡ 13\n\nNext, we need to compute the value of s. We can do this using the formula:\n\ns ≡ k^(-1) * (h - a * r) mod (p-1)\n\nFirst, we need to find the modular inverse of k (mod p-1). In our case, k = 4 and p-1 = 16. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we can find that the modular inverse of 4 (mod 16) is 4.\n\nNow, we can compute s:\n\ns ≡ 4^(-1) * (8 - 2 * 13) mod 16\ns ≡ 4 * (-18) mod 16\ns ≡ 4 * (-2) mod 16\ns ≡ -8 mod 16\ns ≡ 8\n\nSo, the value of s (the signature) is 8. The ElGamal digital signature for the given parameters is (r, s) = (13, 8)."
