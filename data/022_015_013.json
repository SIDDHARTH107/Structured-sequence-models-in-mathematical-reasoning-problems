    "message_2": "To use the Schwarz reflection principle, we first need to extend the function f(z) to an analytic function on a larger domain that includes the interval (1, ∞). We do this by reflecting the function across the real axis.\n\nLet g(z) be the function defined as follows:\n\ng(z) = f(z) for z in D,\ng(z) = f(conj(z)) for z in D* (where D* is the reflection of D across the real axis, i.e., D* = {z : |conj(z)| < 1}).\n\nSince f(z) is holomorphic on D and real-valued on the real axis, g(z) is holomorphic on the union of D and D*.\n\nNow, let h(z) = g(1/z). Then h(z) is holomorphic on the region {z : |z| > 1} (which is the image of D and D* under the transformation z -> 1/z). Moreover, h(z) is real-valued on the interval (1, ∞) since g(z) is real-valued on the real axis.\n\nTo find f(z) on the interval (1, ∞), we need to find h(z) on this interval. Since h(z) = g(1/z) = f(conj(1/z)), we have:\n\nf(z) = f(conj(1/z)) for z in (1, ∞).\n\nThis gives us the desired extension of f(z) to the interval (1, ∞) using the Schwarz reflection principle."
