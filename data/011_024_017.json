    "message_1": "A factory can produce 800 units of product A and 600 units of product B per day. The demand for product A is 500 units per day, and the demand for product B is 700 units per day. Additionally, it costs $2 to produce each unit of A and $3 to produce each unit of B. What is the minimum cost required to meet the daily demands for both products? Use the network flow algorithm to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the network flow algorithm, we will create a network graph with nodes representing the production and demand of products A and B, and edges representing the flow of products between these nodes.\n\n1. Create nodes for the factory's production capacity for products A and B (source nodes), and nodes for the daily demand for products A and B (sink nodes).\n\n2. Add edges with capacities equal to the production capacity and costs per unit:\n   - From the source node for product A to the sink node for product A, with a capacity of 800 units and a cost of $2 per unit.\n   - From the source node for product B to the sink node for product B, with a capacity of 600 units and a cost of $3 per unit.\n\n3. Add edges with infinite capacity and zero cost between the source and sink nodes for products A and B, to allow for the possibility of producing more of one product to meet the demand for the other product.\n\n4. Apply the network flow algorithm to find the minimum-cost flow that satisfies the demand for both products.\n\nThe resulting flow will be:\n- 500 units of product A produced at a cost of $2 per unit, for a total cost of $1000.\n- 700 units of product B produced at a cost of $3 per unit, for a total cost of $2100.\n- 300 units of product A produced at a cost of $2 per unit, and then converted to product B at no additional cost, to meet the remaining demand for product B. This adds an additional cost of $600.\n\nThe minimum cost required to meet the daily demands for both products is $1000 + $2100 + $600 = $3700."
