    "message_1": "Suppose a company produces two types of products, A and B. The company wants to maximize its daily profit, which is calculated as the sum of the profit obtained from selling product A and product B. The cost of producing each product is given as follows:\n\n- Producing one unit of product A costs $5.\n- Producing one unit of product B costs $7.\n\nThe company has the following constraints:\n\n- The daily production capacity is 500 units.\n- The minimum number of units produced daily for either product A or B is 50.\n- The maximum number of units produced daily for either product A or B is 350.\n- The daily demand for product A is at most 400 units.\n- The daily demand for product B is at most 450 units.\n\nUsing the differential evolution method, find the optimal daily production plan for the company, and calculate the maximum daily profit.",
    "message_2": "To use the differential evolution method, we first need to define the objective function to maximize and the constraints. Let x be the number of units of product A produced daily, and y be the number of units of product B produced daily. The profit function to maximize is:\n\nProfit = p_A * x + p_B * y - 5x - 7y\n\nwhere p_A and p_B are the selling prices of product A and product B, respectively. Since we don't have the selling prices, let's assume p_A = $10 and p_B = $12 as an example. Then the profit function becomes:\n\nProfit = 5x + 5y\n\nNow, we need to define the constraints:\n\n1. 50 <= x <= 350\n2. 50 <= y <= 350\n3. x + y <= 500\n4. x <= 400\n5. y <= 450\n\nNow we can use the differential evolution method to find the optimal daily production plan. In Python, we can use the scipy.optimize.differential_evolution function to solve this problem. Here's an example code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\n\ndef profit_function(x):\n    return -1 * (5 * x[0] + 5 * x[1])\n\nconstraints = [(50, 350), (50, 350)]\n\ndef constraint1(x):\n    return 500 - (x[0] + x[1])\n\ndef constraint2(x):\n    return 400 - x[0]\n\ndef constraint3(x):\n    return 450 - x[1]\n\nresult = differential_evolution(profit_function, constraints, constraints=[{'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint1},\n                                                                            {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint2},\n                                                                            {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint3}])\n\noptimal_production = result.x\nmax_profit = -1 * result.fun\n\nprint(\"Optimal daily production plan: Product A =\", optimal_production[0], \"units, Product B =\", optimal_production[1], \"units\")\nprint(\"Maximum daily profit: $\", max_profit)\n```\n\nPlease note that the actual optimal production plan and maximum daily profit will depend on the selling prices of product A and product B, which were not provided in the problem statement. The example code above assumes p_A = $10 and p_B = $12."
