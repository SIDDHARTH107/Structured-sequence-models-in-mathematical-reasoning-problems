    "message_2": "The moduli space of stable curves of genus g is denoted by M_g. In our case, we are interested in the moduli space M_3 of stable curves of genus 3. The dimension of M_g can be computed using the formula:\n\ndim(M_g) = 3g - 3\n\nFor g = 3, we have:\n\ndim(M_3) = 3(3) - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6\n\nSo the dimension of the moduli space of stable curves of genus 3 is 6. However, we are interested in the dimension of the moduli space of stable curves of genus 3 that are isomorphic to a fixed curve X.\n\nSince X is a smooth projective curve of genus 3, it has a unique canonical divisor K_X. The canonical map associated to K_X embeds X into the projective space P^2. The automorphism group of X, denoted by Aut(X), acts on the set of such embeddings. The moduli space of stable curves of genus 3 that are isomorphic to X is the quotient of the space of embeddings by the action of Aut(X).\n\nThe dimension of the space of embeddings is the same as the dimension of M_3, which is 6. The dimension of Aut(X) can be computed using the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. For a smooth projective curve of genus 3, the automorphism group is either trivial or isomorphic to Z/2Z, Z/3Z, or Z/4Z. In the first case, the dimension of Aut(X) is 0, and the dimension of the moduli space of stable curves of genus 3 that are isomorphic to X is 6. In the other cases, the dimension of Aut(X) is 1, and the dimension of the moduli space of stable curves of genus 3 that are isomorphic to X is 5.\n\nIn conclusion, the dimension of the moduli space of stable curves of genus 3 that are isomorphic to X is either 5 or 6, depending on the automorphism group of X."
