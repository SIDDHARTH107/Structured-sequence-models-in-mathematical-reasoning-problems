    "message_1": "A furniture company produces two types of tables: a wooden table and a metal table. Each wooden table requires 4 hours of labor and 6 square meters of wood, while each metal table requires 2 hours of labor and 5 square meters of metal. The company has 1000 hours of labor and 800 square meters of wood and 600 square meters of metal for production. The profit margin for each wooden table is $60, while the profit margin for each metal table is $50. What is the optimal number of wooden and metal tables the company should produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of wooden tables and y be the number of metal tables.\n\nThe constraints for labor, wood, and metal are as follows:\n\nLabor: 4x + 2y ≤ 1000\nWood: 6x ≤ 800\nMetal: 5y ≤ 600\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 60x + 50y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region for the constraints. \n\nFrom the wood constraint, we get x ≤ 800/6, which simplifies to x ≤ 133.33. Since we cannot produce a fraction of a table, we can say x ≤ 133.\n\nFrom the metal constraint, we get y ≤ 600/5, which simplifies to y ≤ 120.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the labor constraint as y ≤ (1000 - 4x)/2, which simplifies to y ≤ 500 - 2x.\n\nThe feasible region is defined by the following inequalities:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\nx ≤ 133\ny ≤ 120\ny ≤ 500 - 2x\n\nNow we need to find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\nA(0, 0)\nB(0, 120)\nC(133, 0)\nD(100, 100)\n\nWe can now evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 60(0) + 50(0) = $0\nP(B) = 60(0) + 50(120) = $6000\nP(C) = 60(133) + 50(0) = $7980\nP(D) = 60(100) + 50(100) = $11000\n\nThe maximum profit is $11,000, which occurs when the company produces 100 wooden tables and 100 metal tables."
