    "message_2": "To find the magnetic field intensity in the frequency domain, we first need to find the Fourier transform of the given time-domain current waveform i(t) = 5cos(100πt) amps.\n\nThe Fourier transform of a cosine function is given by:\n\nF(ω) = π[A(δ(ω - ω0) + δ(ω + ω0))],\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the cosine function, ω0 is the angular frequency, and δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nIn our case, A = 5 and ω0 = 100π. Therefore, the Fourier transform of i(t) is:\n\nI(ω) = 5π[δ(ω - 100π) + δ(ω + 100π)].\n\nNow, we can use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field intensity H(ω) in the frequency domain. For an infinitely long straight wire carrying a current I(ω), the magnetic field intensity at a distance r from the wire is given by:\n\nH(ω) = (μ₀/4π) * (2πr) * I(ω),\n\nwhere μ₀ is the permeability of free space (μ₀ = 4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A).\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nH(ω) = (4π × 10^(-7) Tm/A) * (2πr) * 5π[δ(ω - 100π) + δ(ω + 100π)].\n\nSimplifying, we obtain:\n\nH(ω) = 10^(-6) * r * [δ(ω - 100π) + δ(ω + 100π)] A/m.\n\nThis is the magnetic field intensity of the wire in the frequency domain. Note that the magnetic field intensity depends on the distance r from the wire and has two non-zero components at ω = ±100π rad/s."
