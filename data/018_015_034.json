Similarly, B x A is the set of all ordered pairs (b, a) where b is in B and a is in A. Let's find A x B and B x A first:\n\nA x B = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)}\n\nB x A = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)}\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of A x B and B x A, which means we need to find the ordered pairs that are present in both sets. However, since the ordered pairs in A x B have elements from A in the first position and elements from B in the second position, and the ordered pairs in B x A have elements from B in the first position and elements from A in the second position, there are no common ordered pairs between the two sets.\n\nTherefore, (A x B) ∩ (B x A) = ∅ (the empty set)."
