    "message_2": "To prove that the empty set {} is a subset of A, we need to show that every element in the empty set is also an element of A. \n\nBy definition, the empty set has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A. Since there are no counterexamples, it is true that every element in the empty set is also an element of A.\n\nThus, we can conclude that {} ⊆ A, meaning the empty set is a subset of A."
