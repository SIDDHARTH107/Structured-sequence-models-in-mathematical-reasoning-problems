    "message_2": "To find the number of linearly independent holomorphic functions on X, we need to compute the dimension of the space of global holomorphic functions on X, which is given by the Riemann-Roch theorem.\n\nThe Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a smooth projective curve X of genus g and a divisor D on X, the dimension of the space of global holomorphic functions with poles only along D is given by:\n\n$l(D) = deg(D) + 1 - g + l(K - D)$,\n\nwhere K is the canonical divisor on X, and l(K - D) is the dimension of the space of global holomorphic functions with zeroes only along D.\n\nIn our case, X is a smooth plane curve of degree 4, so it is a quartic curve. The genus of a smooth plane curve of degree d is given by the formula:\n\n$g = \\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$.\n\nFor a quartic curve, we have:\n\n$g = \\frac{(4-1)(4-2)}{2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{2} = 3$.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of linearly independent holomorphic functions on X, which corresponds to the case when D is the zero divisor (i.e., deg(D) = 0). Thus, we have:\n\n$l(D) = deg(D) + 1 - g + l(K - D) = 0 + 1 - 3 + l(K)$.\n\nSince X is a smooth plane curve of degree 4, the canonical divisor K is given by the formula:\n\n$K = (d-3)H$,\n\nwhere H is the hyperplane divisor (i.e., the divisor corresponding to a line in the plane). In our case, we have:\n\n$K = (4-3)H = H$.\n\nThus, we have:\n\n$l(D) = -2 + l(K)$.\n\nNow, we need to compute l(K). The Riemann-Roch theorem applied to the canonical divisor K gives:\n\n$l(K) = deg(K) + 1 - g + l(0)$,\n\nwhere 0 is the zero divisor. Since deg(K) = deg(H) = 1 and g = 3, we have:\n\n$l(K) = 1 + 1 - 3 + l(0) = -1 + l(0)$.\n\nSince l(0) is the dimension of the space of global holomorphic functions with no poles, it is equal to 1 (corresponding to the constant functions). Thus, we have:\n\n$l(K) = -1 + 1 = 0$.\n\nFinally, we have:\n\n$l(D) = -2 + l(K) = -2 + 0 = -2$.\n\nHowever, l(D) must be a non-negative integer, as it represents the dimension of a vector space. In this case, the negative value indicates that there are no linearly independent holomorphic functions on X, other than the constant functions. Therefore, the number of linearly independent holomorphic functions on X is 0."
