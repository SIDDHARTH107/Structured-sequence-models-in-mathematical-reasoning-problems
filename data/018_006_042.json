    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set of all integers from 1 to 10. If set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and set A' is its complement, what is A ∪ A'?",
    "message_2": "A' is the complement of set A, which means it contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in set A. Since U contains all integers from 1 to 10, and set A contains {1, 2, 3, 4}, set A' will contain the integers {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n\nNow, we need to find A ∪ A', which is the union of sets A and A'. The union of two sets contains all the elements that are in either set. In this case, A ∪ A' will contain all the elements in set A and all the elements in set A'.\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4} ∪ {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}\n\nSo, A ∪ A' is the set of all integers from 1 to 10."
