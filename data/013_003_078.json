    "message_1": "In an Ultimatum Game, Player 1 has $10 to split with Player 2. Player 1 must make an offer to Player 2, who can either accept or reject the offer. If Player 2 accepts, the money is split accordingly. However, if Player 2 rejects, neither player gets anything. If Player 2 has a minimum acceptable offer of $3, what offer should Player 1 make to maximize their own earnings?",
    "message_2": "In the Ultimatum Game, Player 1 should make an offer of $3 to Player 2 to maximize their own earnings. This is because Player 2 has a minimum acceptable offer of $3, and if Player 1 offers anything less, Player 2 will reject the offer, and neither player will receive any money. By offering $3, Player 1 ensures that Player 2 will accept the offer, and Player 1 will keep the remaining $7."
