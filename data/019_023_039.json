    "message_2": "The next number in the series is 13. The pattern in this sequence is that each number is an odd number, and each subsequent number is obtained by adding 2 to the previous number. Using inductive logic, we can describe the pattern as follows:\n\n1. The first number in the series is 1.\n2. For any number n in the series, the next number is n + 2.\n\nSo, the sequence continues as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, ... and so on."
