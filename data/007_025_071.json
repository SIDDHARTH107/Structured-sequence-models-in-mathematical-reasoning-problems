    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a base number (g). In this case, we will use g = 5, which is a common choice for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n2. Alice computes A = g^a mod p, where a is Alice's secret number and p is the prime number. In this case, A = 5^6 mod 23.\n3. Bob computes B = g^b mod p, where b is Bob's secret number and p is the prime number. In this case, B = 5^15 mod 23.\n4. Alice and Bob exchange their computed values A and B.\n5. Alice computes the shared secret key as K = B^a mod p. In this case, K = B^6 mod 23.\n6. Bob computes the shared secret key as K = A^b mod p. In this case, K = A^15 mod 23.\n7. If both Alice and Bob computed the same shared secret key, the key exchange is successful.\n\nNow let's compute the values:\n\nA = 5^6 mod 23 = 15625 mod 23 = 8\nB = 5^15 mod 23 = 30517578125 mod 23 = 19\n\nNow Alice computes the shared secret key:\n\nK = 19^6 mod 23 = 47045881 mod 23 = 2\n\nAnd Bob computes the shared secret key:\n\nK = 8^15 mod 23 = 35184372088832 mod 23 = 2\n\nSince both Alice and Bob computed the same shared secret key (K = 2), the key exchange is successful. The shared secret key is 2."
