    "message_2": "1. Since there are only two critical points, one with index 0 and the other with index $2g$, we have $m_i = 0$ for $i \\neq 0, 2g$. The Morse homology groups $H_i(S)$ are defined as the homology of the Morse complex, which is given by\n$$C_i = \\bigoplus_{p \\in Crit_i(f)} \\mathbb{Z}_p,$$\nwhere $Crit_i(f)$ denotes the set of critical points of index $i$. Since $m_i = 0$ for $i \\neq 0, 2g$, we have $C_i = 0$ for $i \\neq 0, 2g$. Therefore, the Morse homology groups $H_i(S)$ vanish for $i \\neq 0, 2g$.\n\n2. For $i = 2g$, we have $m_{2g} = 1$, so the Morse complex is given by\n$$C_{2g} = \\mathbb{Z}.$$\nSince there are no critical points of index $2g + 1$, the boundary map $\\partial_{2g + 1}: C_{2g + 1} \\to C_{2g}$ is trivial. Therefore, the Morse homology group $H_{2g}(S)$ is given by\n$$H_{2g}(S) = \\ker(\\partial_{2g}) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_{2g + 1}) = \\mathbb{Z} / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}.$$\n\n3. For $i = 0$, we have $m_0 = 1$, so the Morse complex is given by\n$$C_0 = \\mathbb{Z}.$$\nIf the minimum value of $f$ is less than or equal to the maximum value of $f$, then there are no critical points of index 1, and the boundary map $\\partial_1: C_1 \\to C_0$ is trivial. Therefore, the Morse homology group $H_0(S)$ is given by\n$$H_0(S) = \\ker(\\partial_0) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_1) = \\mathbb{Z} / 0 = \\mathbb{Z}.$$\nIf the minimum value of $f$ is greater than the maximum value of $f$, then there are no critical points of index 1, and the boundary map $\\partial_1: C_1 \\to C_0$ is trivial. Therefore, the Morse homology group $H_0(S)$ is given by\n$$H_0(S) = \\ker(\\partial_0) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_1) = 0 / 0 = 0.$$\n\nNow, let's calculate the Morse homology groups of the torus $S$ with the Morse function $f(x,y) = \\cos(x) + \\cos(y)$. Since $g = 1$, we have $2g = 2$. The critical points of $f$ are given by the solutions of the equations\n$$\\begin{cases}\n-\\sin(x) = 0 \\\\\n-\\sin(y) = 0\n\\end{cases}$$\nwhich are $(x,y) = (0,0), (0,\\pi), (\\pi,0), (\\pi,\\pi)$. The Hessian matrix of $f$ at these points is given by\n$$H_f(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\cos(x) & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\cos(y)\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\nAt $(0,0)$ and $(\\pi,\\pi)$, the Hessian has two negative eigenvalues, so these points have index 2. At $(0,\\pi)$ and $(\\pi,0)$, the Hessian has two positive eigenvalues, so these points have index 0. Therefore, we have $m_0 = 2$ and $m_2 = 2$. The Morse complex is given by\n$$C_0 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}, \\quad C_1 = 0, \\quad C_2 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}.$$\nSince there are no critical points of index 1, the boundary maps $\\partial_1$ and $\\partial_2$ are trivial. Therefore, the Morse homology groups are given by\n$$H_0(S) = \\ker(\\partial_0) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_1) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} / 0 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z},$$\n$$H_1(S) = \\ker(\\partial_1) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_2) = 0 / 0 = 0,$$\n$$H_2(S) = \\ker(\\partial_2) / \\operatorname{im}(\\partial_3) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} / 0 = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}.$$"
