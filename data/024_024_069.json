    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartan connection matrix $\\theta$, we first need to express the connection form $\\omega$ in terms of the basis of the tangent space of the manifold $M$. In this case, the basis of the tangent space at a point $p \\in M$ is given by the coordinate vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}$.\n\nNow, we can express the connection form $\\omega$ as a linear combination of these basis vector fields:\n\n$$\\omega = A_1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} + A_2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}$$\n\nSince $\\omega = dx_1$, we can see that $A_1 = 1$ and $A_2 = 0$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$\\omega = 1 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}$$\n\nNow, we can construct the Cartan connection matrix $\\theta$ using the coefficients $A_1$ and $A_2$. The matrix $\\theta$ is a 2x2 matrix with entries $\\theta_{ij}$, where $\\theta_{ij}$ represents the connection between the $i$-th and $j$-th basis vector fields. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\theta = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\theta_{11} & \\theta_{12} \\\\\n\\theta_{21} & \\theta_{22}\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nSince $\\omega$ only has a non-zero component in the direction of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}$, we can deduce that the connection between the basis vector fields is given by:\n\n$$\\theta_{11} = A_1 = 1$$\n$$\\theta_{12} = \\theta_{21} = \\theta_{22} = 0$$\n\nThus, the Cartan connection matrix $\\theta$ for this manifold is:\n\n$$\\theta = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}$$"
