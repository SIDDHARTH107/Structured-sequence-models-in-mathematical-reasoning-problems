    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has dimensions 6 cm × 8 cm × 10 cm. Find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism.",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem. If the dimensions of the rectangular prism are a, b, and c, and the diagonal is d, then the formula is:\n\nd = √(a² + b² + c²)\n\nIn this case, a = 6 cm, b = 8 cm, and c = 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nd = √(6² + 8² + 10²)\nd = √(36 + 64 + 100)\nd = √(200)\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is √(200) cm, which can be simplified to 10√(2) cm."
