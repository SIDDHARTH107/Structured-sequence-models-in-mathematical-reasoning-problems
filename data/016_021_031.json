    "message_2": "The fractal dimension of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(S)\n\nwhere D is the fractal dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, there are 3 self-similar pieces (N = 3) and the scaling factor is 2 (S = 2). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.5849625\n\nSo, the fractal dimension of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is approximately 1.585."
