To do this, we need to show that A x B ≠ B x A.\n\nAs we have already found the Cartesian products A x B and B x A, we can see that they are not equal:\n\nA x B = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)}\nB x A = {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}\n\nSince A x B ≠ B x A, we can conclude that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to intersection."
