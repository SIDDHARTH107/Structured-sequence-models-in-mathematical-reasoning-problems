    "message_2": "To minimize the surface area of the cylindrical tin can, we will use calculus. Let the radius of the base of the cylinder be r and the height be h. The volume V and surface area A of the cylinder are given by the following formulas:\n\nV = πr^2h\nA = 2πrh + 2πr^2\n\nWe are given that the volume of the tin can is 500 cubic centimeters:\n\n500 = πr^2h\n\nWe need to find the dimensions (r and h) that minimize the surface area A. To do this, we will first eliminate one of the variables by solving for h in the volume equation:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the surface area equation:\n\nA = 2πr(500 / (πr^2)) + 2πr^2\nA = (1000 / r) + 2πr^2\n\nTo minimize A, we will find its critical points by taking the derivative of A with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dr = -1000 / r^2 + 4πr\n\nNow, set dA/dr = 0 and solve for r:\n\n0 = -1000 / r^2 + 4πr\n1000 / r^2 = 4πr\n1000 = 4πr^3\nr^3 = 1000 / (4π)\nr^3 = 250 / π\nr = (250 / π)^(1/3)\n\nNow, find the height h using the expression we derived earlier:\n\nh = 500 / (πr^2)\nh = 500 / (π(250 / π)^(2/3))\nh = 500 / (250^(2/3) / π^(1/3))\nh = 500 * π^(1/3) / 250^(2/3)\n\nSo, the dimensions of the cylindrical tin can with the smallest surface area are:\n\nr ≈ (250 / π)^(1/3) cm\nh ≈ 500 * π^(1/3) / 250^(2/3) cm"
