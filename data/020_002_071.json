    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products A and B. The profit per unit of A is $10 and the profit per unit of B is $15. The company can produce a maximum of 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B. Production of each unit of A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time, while production of each unit of B requires 4 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time. The company has 1000 hours of labor time and 800 hours of machine time available. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profits?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x ≤ 200 (maximum units of product A)\n2. y ≤ 150 (maximum units of product B)\n3. 2x + 4y ≤ 1000 (labor time constraint)\n4. 3x + y ≤ 800 (machine time constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 10x + 15y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x = 200 (vertical line)\n2. y = 150 (horizontal line)\n3. y = (1000 - 2x) / 4 (labor time constraint line)\n4. y = 800 - 3x (machine time constraint line)\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at the intersection points of the constraint lines:\n\nA(200, 0)\nB(200, 150)\nC(100, 150)\nD(160, 80)\n\nNow we need to evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\nP(A) = 10(200) + 15(0) = 2000\nP(B) = 10(200) + 15(150) = 4250\nP(C) = 10(100) + 15(150) = 3250\nP(D) = 10(160) + 15(80) = 4000\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at point B, with 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B. The company should produce 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B to maximize its profits, which will be $4250."
