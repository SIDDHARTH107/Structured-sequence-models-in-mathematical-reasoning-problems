    "message_1": "Suppose that the probability of financial fraud occurring in a company is 0.05. If there are 250 companies in a particular industry, what is the probability that at least 10 of them will experience financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, financial fraud) in n trials (companies)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (financial fraud) for each trial (company), which is 0.05\n- n is the number of trials (companies), which is 250\n- k is the number of successes (financial frauds), which we want to be at least 10\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 10 companies experiencing financial fraud, we need to find the probability of 10, 11, 12, ..., 250 companies experiencing financial fraud and sum them up. However, calculating this directly would be computationally intensive. Instead, we can find the probability of 0 to 9 companies experiencing financial fraud and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, we want to find:\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - P(X < 10) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9))\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each k from 0 to 9 using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(250, k) * (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(250-k)\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities for k = 0 to 9, we sum them up and subtract the result from 1:\n\nP(X >= 10) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 9))\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the probabilities and sum them up, we get:\n\nP(X >= 10) â‰ˆ 1 - 0.031 = 0.969\n\nSo, the probability that at least 10 of the 250 companies will experience financial fraud is approximately 0.969 or 96.9%."
