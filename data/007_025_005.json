    "message_2": "To find the shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Alice and Bob agree on a prime number (p) and a primitive root (g). In this case, p = 7 and g = 3.\n2. Alice chooses a secret number (a) and calculates A = g^a mod p. In this case, a = 2, so A = 3^2 mod 7 = 9 mod 7 = 2.\n3. Bob chooses a secret number (b) and calculates B = g^b mod p. In this case, b = 4, so B = 3^4 mod 7 = 81 mod 7 = 4.\n4. Alice and Bob exchange their calculated values (A and B).\n5. Alice calculates the shared secret key as K_A = B^a mod p. In this case, K_A = 4^2 mod 7 = 16 mod 7 = 2.\n6. Bob calculates the shared secret key as K_B = A^b mod p. In this case, K_B = 2^4 mod 7 = 16 mod 7 = 2.\n\nSince K_A and K_B are equal, Alice and Bob have arrived at the same shared secret key, which is 2."
