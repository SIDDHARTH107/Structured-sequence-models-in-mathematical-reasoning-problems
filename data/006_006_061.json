    "message_1": "A basketball player has a 80% free throw shooting accuracy. If he takes 10 free throws in a game, what is the probability that he makes all of them?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that the basketball player makes all 10 free throws, we need to multiply the probability of making each individual free throw. Since the player has an 80% accuracy, the probability of making a single free throw is 0.8.\n\nProbability of making all 10 free throws = (0.8)^10 = 0.1073741824\n\nSo, the probability that the basketball player makes all 10 free throws is approximately 10.74%."
