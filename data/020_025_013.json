The distances (in miles) between the houses are as follows:\n- House 1 to House 2: 2\n- House 1 to House 3: 5\n- House 1 to House 4: 3\n- House 1 to House 5: 6\n- House 2 to House 3: 4\n- House 2 to House 4: 2\n- House 2 to House 5: 3\n- House 3 to House 4: 1\n- House 3 to House 5: 2\n- House 4 to House 5: 4\n\nWhat is the shortest total distance the delivery company can travel to deliver to all 5 houses, starting and ending at House 1?",

House 1 -> House 2 -> House 3 -> House 4 -> House 5 -> House 1\nDistance: 2 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 6 = 17 miles\n\n2. House 1 -> House 2 -> House 3 -> House 5 -> House 4 -> House 1\nDistance: 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 15 miles\n\n3. House 1 -> House 2 -> House 4 -> House 3 -> House 5 -> House 1\nDistance: 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 6 = 13 miles\n\n4. House 1 -> House 2 -> House 4 -> House 5 -> House 3 -> House 1\nDistance: 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 15 miles\n\n5. House 1 -> House 2 -> House 5 -> House 3 -> House 4 -> House 1\nDistance: 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 11 miles\n\n6. House 1 -> House 2 -> House 5 -> House 4 -> House 3 -> House 1\nDistance: 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 5 = 15 miles\n\nOut of these possible routes, the shortest total distance is 11 miles, which is the route House 1 -> House 2 -> House 5 -> House 3 -> House 4 -> House 1."
