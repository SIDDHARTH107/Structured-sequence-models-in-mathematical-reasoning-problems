    "message_2": "To find the Fourier coefficients of the given function f(x) = xe^(-x) over the interval [0, ∞), we first need to extend the function to be periodic over the entire real line. Since the function is defined only for x ≥ 0, we can extend it by defining f(x) = 0 for x < 0. Now, we have a piecewise function:\n\nf(x) = { xe^(-x) for x ≥ 0\n       { 0        for x < 0\n\nNext, we need to find the Fourier series representation of this function. Since the function is neither even nor odd, we will use the general Fourier series formula:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nωx) + b_n * sin(nωx)]\n\nwhere ω is the fundamental frequency, a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the summation is from n = 1 to ∞.\n\nTo find the Fourier coefficients, we will use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx from -L to L\na_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nωx)]dx from -L to L\nb_n = (1/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nωx)]dx from -L to L\n\nSince our function is defined over the interval [0, ∞), we cannot directly apply these formulas. However, we can use the Laplace transform to find the Fourier coefficients.\n\nLet F(s) be the Laplace transform of f(x):\n\nF(s) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-sx)]dx from 0 to ∞\n\nFor f(x) = xe^(-x), we have:\n\nF(s) = ∫[xe^(-x) * e^(-sx)]dx from 0 to ∞\n     = ∫[xe^(-(s+1)x)]dx from 0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can find the Laplace transform:\n\nF(s) = 1/((s+1)^2)\n\nTo find the Fourier coefficients, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s):\n\nf(x) = L^(-1)[F(s)]\n\nUnfortunately, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = 1/((s+1)^2) does not yield a simple Fourier series representation. Therefore, it is not possible to find the Fourier coefficients of the function f(x) = xe^(-x) over the interval [0, ∞) using the standard Fourier series approach."
