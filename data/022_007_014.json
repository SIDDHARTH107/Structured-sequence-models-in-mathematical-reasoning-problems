    "message_2": "Since $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, the fundamental theorem of algebra states that it has exactly 3 roots, counting multiplicities. We are given that one of the roots is $z_0 = 2i$. \n\nNow, let's use Liouville's theorem, which states that if a polynomial has a complex root, then its complex conjugate is also a root. Therefore, the complex conjugate of $z_0 = 2i$ is also a root of $f(z)$. The complex conjugate of $2i$ is $-2i$. So, we have two roots: $2i$ and $-2i$.\n\nNow, let's find the third root. Since we know two roots, we can factor the polynomial as follows:\n\n$f(z) = (z - 2i)(z + 2i)(z - z_1)$, where $z_1$ is the third root.\n\nExpanding the first two factors, we get:\n\n$(z - 2i)(z + 2i) = z^2 + 4$\n\nNow, we can divide the original polynomial by this quadratic to find the third root:\n\n$f(z) = (z^3 - 2z^2 + z + 2) / (z^2 + 4)$\n\nUsing polynomial long division or synthetic division, we find:\n\n$z^3 - 2z^2 + z + 2 = (z^2 + 4)(z - 1)$\n\nSo, the third root is $z_1 = 1$.\n\nIn conclusion, the three roots of the polynomial $f(z) = z^3 - 2z^2 + z + 2$ are $2i$, $-2i$, and $1$."
