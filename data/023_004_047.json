    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given function f(x) = 2e^(-3x)cos(4x), we will use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(x) * e^(-iωx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nHere, f(x) = 2e^(-3x)cos(4x) and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nSo, F(ω) = ∫[2e^(-3x)cos(4x) * e^(-iωx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, let's multiply the terms inside the integral:\n\nF(ω) = 2∫[e^(-3x)cos(4x) * e^(-iωx)] dx from -∞ to ∞\nF(ω) = 2∫[e^(-3x - iωx)cos(4x)] dx from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we can use integration by parts to solve this integral. Let u = e^(-3x - iωx) and dv = cos(4x) dx. Then, du = (-3 - iω)e^(-3x - iωx) dx and v = (1/4)sin(4x).\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫udv = uv - ∫vdu\n\nF(ω) = 2[(1/4)e^(-3x - iωx)sin(4x) - (1/4)∫(-3 - iω)e^(-3x - iωx)sin(4x) dx] from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining integral. We can use integration by parts again. Let u = (-3 - iω)e^(-3x - iωx) and dv = sin(4x) dx. Then, du = (-3 - iω)^2e^(-3x - iωx) dx and v = (-1/4)cos(4x).\n\nF(ω) = 2[(1/4)e^(-3x - iωx)sin(4x) - (1/4)[(-3 - iω)e^(-3x - iωx)(-1/4)cos(4x) - (1/4)∫(-3 - iω)^2e^(-3x - iωx)(-1/4)cos(4x) dx]] from -∞ to ∞\n\nNow, we have a complex integral that is difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use the Laplace transform to find the Fourier transform of the given function. The Laplace transform of f(t) = e^(-at)cos(bt) is F(s) = (s + a) / ((s + a)^2 + b^2). Here, a = 3 and b = 4.\n\nTo find the Fourier transform, we need to replace s with iω:\n\nF(ω) = (iω + 3) / ((iω + 3)^2 + 4^2)\n\nF(ω) = (iω + 3) / (ω^2 - 6iω - 9 + 16)\n\nF(ω) = (iω + 3) / (ω^2 + 7 - 6iω)\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = 2e^(-3x)cos(4x) for -∞ < x < ∞ is F(ω) = 2(iω + 3) / (ω^2 + 7 - 6iω)."
