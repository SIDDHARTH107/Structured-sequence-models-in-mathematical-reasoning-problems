The heights of the students (in inches) are: \n\n66, 68, 63, 70, 64, 71, 67, 68, 65, 69, 62, 72, 67, 69, 63, 70, 65, 71, 68, 67.\n\nThe corresponding weights of the students (in pounds) are:\n\n120, 142, 110, 148, 128, 153, 125, 140, 122, 145, 108, 155, 134, 142, 114, 152, 132, 158, 138, 130.\n\nFind the correlation coefficient between the heights and weights of the 20 students in the class.",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between the heights and weights of the 20 students, we will first need to calculate the mean of both the heights and weights, the standard deviation of both sets of data, and then use the formula for the correlation coefficient.\n\n1. Calculate the mean of heights (h) and weights (w):\nMean height (h̄) = (66 + 68 + 63 + 70 + 64 + 71 + 67 + 68 + 65 + 69 + 62 + 72 + 67 + 69 + 63 + 70 + 65 + 71 + 68 + 67) / 20 = 1340 / 20 = 67 inches\nMean weight (w̄) = (120 + 142 + 110 + 148 + 128 + 153 + 125 + 140 + 122 + 145 + 108 + 155 + 134 + 142 + 114 + 152 + 132 + 158 + 138 + 130) / 20 = 2700 / 20 = 135 pounds\n\n2. Calculate the standard deviation of heights (σh) and weights (σw):\nFor heights:\na. Calculate the sum of the squared differences from the mean: Σ(h - h̄)^2 = (1 + 1 + 16 + 9 + 9 + 16 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 25 + 25 + 0 + 4 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 16 + 1 + 0) = 161\nb. Divide the sum by the number of data points (n): 161 / 20 = 8.05\nc. Take the square root of the result: √8.05 ≈ 2.84\n\nFor weights:\na. Calculate the sum of the squared differences from the mean: Σ(w - w̄)^2 = (225 + 49 + 625 + 169 + 49 + 324 + 100 + 25 + 169 + 100 + 729 + 400 + 1 + 49 + 441 + 289 + 9 + 529 + 9 + 25) = 4040\nb. Divide the sum by the number of data points (n): 4040 / 20 = 202\nc. Take the square root of the result: √202 ≈ 14.21\n\n3. Calculate the correlation coefficient (r):\na. Calculate the sum of the product of the differences from the mean: Σ(h - h̄)(w - w̄) = (-15)(1) + (-7)(7) + (25)(-16) + (13)(9) + (-7)(-7) + (18)(16) + (0)(-10) + (1)(5) + (-2)(-13) + (4)(10) + (37)(-27) + (20)(20) + (0)(-1) + (4)(7) + (16)(-21) + (9)(17) + (-2)(-3) + (16)(23) + (1)(3) + (0)(-5) = 2350\nb. Divide the sum by the product of the standard deviations of heights and weights and the number of data points: 2350 / (2.84 * 14.21 * 20) ≈ 0.925\n\nThe correlation coefficient (r) between the heights and weights of the 20 students in the class is approximately 0.925."
