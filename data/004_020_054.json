    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for the student to solve: \n\n\"A crate weighing 100 pounds is pushed up a ramp that is 20 feet long and inclined at an angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal. The force exerted on the crate is given by F(x) = 50 - 2x pounds, where x is the distance the crate has moved up the ramp. Find the work done by the force required to move the crate up the ramp using integration.\"",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force required to move the crate up the ramp, we need to integrate the force function F(x) over the distance the crate moves, which is the length of the ramp (20 feet). \n\nFirst, let's find the component of the force F(x) that is parallel to the ramp. The angle between the force and the ramp is 30 degrees. So, the component of the force parallel to the ramp is F(x) * cos(30°).\n\nNow, let's integrate the force function F(x) * cos(30°) over the distance x from 0 to 20 feet.\n\nWork = ∫(F(x) * cos(30°)) dx from 0 to 20\n\ncos(30°) = √3 / 2, so we have:\n\nWork = ∫((50 - 2x) * (√3 / 2)) dx from 0 to 20\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nWork = (√3 / 2) * ∫(50 - 2x) dx from 0 to 20\n\nWork = (√3 / 2) * [50x - x^2] from 0 to 20\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = (√3 / 2) * [(50 * 20 - 20^2) - (50 * 0 - 0^2)]\n\nWork = (√3 / 2) * (1000 - 400)\n\nWork = (√3 / 2) * 600\n\nWork ≈ 519.62 foot-pounds\n\nSo, the work done by the force required to move the crate up the ramp is approximately 519.62 foot-pounds."
