    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the function f(x) = 4x^2 over the interval -1 to 1, we need to compute the Fourier coefficients. The Fourier series of a function f(x) on the interval [-L, L] is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * π * x / L) + b_n * sin(n * π * x / L)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and they are defined as:\n\na_0 = (1 / L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) dx\na_n = (1 / L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * cos(n * π * x / L) dx\nb_n = (1 / L) * ∫[-L, L] f(x) * sin(n * π * x / L) dx\n\nIn our case, f(x) = 4x^2 and L = 1. So, let's compute the coefficients:\n\na_0 = (1 / 1) * ∫[-1, 1] 4x^2 dx = ∫[-1, 1] 4x^2 dx = [4/3 * x^3](-1 to 1) = (4/3) - (-4/3) = 8/3\n\na_n = (1 / 1) * ∫[-1, 1] 4x^2 * cos(n * π * x) dx\nSince 4x^2 is an even function and cos(n * π * x) is also an even function, their product is also an even function. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\na_n = 2 * ∫[0, 1] 4x^2 * cos(n * π * x) dx\nNow, we can integrate by parts:\nLet u = 4x^2, dv = cos(n * π * x) dx\ndu = 8x dx, v = (1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula, ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du:\na_n = 2 * [(4x^2 * (1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x)) - ∫(1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x) * 8x dx] (0 to 1)\n\nNow, we need to integrate again by parts:\nLet u = 8x, dv = (1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x) dx\ndu = 8 dx, v = (-1 / (n^2 * π^2)) * cos(n * π * x)\n\na_n = 2 * [(4x^2 * (1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x)) - (8x * (-1 / (n^2 * π^2)) * cos(n * π * x) - ∫(-1 / (n^2 * π^2)) * cos(n * π * x) * 8 dx)] (0 to 1)\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the integral:\na_n = 2 * [(4 * (1 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π)) - (8 * (-1 / (n^2 * π^2)) * cos(n * π) - 8 / (n^2 * π^2) * ∫cos(n * π * x) dx)] (0 to 1)\n\na_n = 2 * [(4 / (n * π) * sin(n * π)) - (8 / (n^2 * π^2) * cos(n * π) - 8 / (n^3 * π^3) * sin(n * π * x))] (0 to 1)\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, the Fourier coefficients a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nNow, let's compute the b_n coefficients:\nb_n = (1 / 1) * ∫[-1, 1] 4x^2 * sin(n * π * x) dx\nSince 4x^2 is an even function and sin(n * π * x) is an odd function, their product is an odd function. Therefore, the integral over a symmetric interval will be zero:\nb_n = 0 for all n.\n\nSo, the Fourier transform of f(x) = 4x^2 over the interval -1 to 1 is:\n\nf(x) = 8/3, since all the other coefficients are zero."
