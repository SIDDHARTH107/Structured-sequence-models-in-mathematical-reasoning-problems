    "message_2": "To find the value of angle theta in degrees, we can use the inverse cosine function (also known as arccos or cos^-1):\n\ntheta = arccos(0.6)\n\nNow, we need to convert this to degrees:\n\ntheta = arccos(0.6) * (180 / pi)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\ntheta ≈ 53.13 degrees\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\ntheta ≈ 53 degrees"
