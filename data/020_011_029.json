The selling price of each unit of A is $35, and for B is $45. How many units of A and B should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of A produced and y be the number of units of B produced.\n\nThe profit for each unit of A is $35 - $20 = $15, and the profit for each unit of B is $45 - $30 = $15.\n\nThe total profit P can be represented as:\nP = 15x + 15y\n\nThe constraints are:\nx ≤ 500 (cannot produce more than 500 units of A)\ny ≤ 400 (cannot produce more than 400 units of B)\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the maximum value of P within these constraints.\n\nSince the profit per unit is the same for both products, we can maximize the profit by producing as many units as possible within the constraints. \n\nIf the company produces 500 units of A, the profit from A will be 15 * 500 = $7500.\nIf the company produces 400 units of B, the profit from B will be 15 * 400 = $6000.\n\nSo, to maximize the profit, the company should produce 500 units of A and 400 units of B. The maximum profit will be $7500 + $6000 = $13,500."
