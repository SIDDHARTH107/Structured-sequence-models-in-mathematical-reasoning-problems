    "message_2": "There are three non-isomorphic groups of order 60: the cyclic group Z_60, the alternating group A_5, and the dicyclic group Dic_30.\n\nTo prove that every group of order 60 is isomorphic to one of these three groups, we will use the Sylow theorems and consider the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. By the Sylow theorems, we have the following possibilities for the number of Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. n_2 ∈ {1, 3, 5, 15}, where n_2 is the number of Sylow 2-subgroups.\n2. n_3 ∈ {1, 4}, where n_3 is the number of Sylow 3-subgroups.\n3. n_5 ∈ {1, 6}, where n_5 is the number of Sylow 5-subgroups.\n\nNow, we analyze the possible structures of G based on these possibilities:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1, n_5 = 1\nIn this case, G has unique Sylow subgroups P_2, P_3, and P_5 of orders 4, 3, and 5, respectively. Since these subgroups are unique, they are normal in G. The order of the product P_2P_3P_5 is lcm(4, 3, 5) = 60, so G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 × P_5, which is the cyclic group Z_60.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, G has no normal Sylow subgroups other than the trivial group and G itself. This implies that G is a simple group. The only simple group of order 60 is the alternating group A_5, so G is isomorphic to A_5.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4, n_5 = 6\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 of order 4, which is normal in G. The factor group G/P_2 has order 15, which is the product of two distinct primes, so G/P_2 is cyclic. By the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem, G is an extension of P_2 by a group of order 15. The only such extension is the dicyclic group Dic_30, so G is isomorphic to Dic_30.\n\nThese are the only possible cases for the structure of G, so every group of order 60 is isomorphic to one of the three groups Z_60, A_5, or Dic_30."
