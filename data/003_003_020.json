    "message_2": "Using the unit circle, the value of cosine of 45 degrees (or π/4 radians) is √2/2 or 1/√2, which are equivalent. This is because, at 45 degrees, the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle represents the cosine value, and in this case, both the x and y coordinates are equal, forming an isosceles right triangle with the hypotenuse being the radius of the unit circle (1)."
