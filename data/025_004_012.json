    "message_2": "In the projective plane, a rational curve can be parameterized by a map from the projective line P^1 to the projective plane P^2. This map can be given by a set of homogeneous polynomials of the same degree, say d, in two variables. The degree of the rational curve is the degree of these polynomials.\n\nNow, we have 8 general points in the projective plane that the rational curve must pass through. For a curve of degree d to pass through these 8 points, we need to satisfy 8 conditions. The number of independent conditions that a curve of degree d can satisfy is given by the binomial coefficient (d+2 choose 2), which counts the number of monomials of degree d in two variables.\n\nWe want to find the smallest degree d such that (d+2 choose 2) >= 8. \n\nFor d = 1, (d+2 choose 2) = (3 choose 2) = 3, which is not enough.\nFor d = 2, (d+2 choose 2) = (4 choose 2) = 6, which is still not enough.\nFor d = 3, (d+2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10, which is enough.\n\nTherefore, the smallest degree of a rational curve passing through 8 general points in the projective plane is d = 3."
