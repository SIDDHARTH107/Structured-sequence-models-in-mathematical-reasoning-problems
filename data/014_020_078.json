    "message_2": "The length of the key used in a Vigen√®re cipher can be determined by analyzing the repeating sequence of the ciphertext. If the ciphertext has a repeating sequence of every 6th letter, it is likely that the key length is 6. This is because the same key letter is applied to the plaintext every 6 positions, causing the pattern to repeat."
