    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the strategies where no player can benefit from changing their strategy, given the other player's strategy.\n\nLet's examine each player's best response to the other player's strategy:\n\n1. If Player 1 cooperates, Player 2's best response is to defect (6 > 4).\n2. If Player 1 defects, Player 2's best response is to defect (2 > 1).\n3. If Player 2 cooperates, Player 1's best response is to defect (6 > 4).\n4. If Player 2 defects, Player 1's best response is to defect (2 > 1).\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that both players' best response is to defect, regardless of the other player's strategy. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for this game is when both players choose to defect, resulting in the payoff (2,2)."
