    "message_1": "A particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well is initially in the ground state. At time t=0, the potential is suddenly changed such that its width is doubled. What is the probability of finding the particle in the ground state after the potential is changed?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of the particle being in the ground state after the potential is changed, we need to find the overlap between the initial ground state wavefunction and the new ground state wavefunction.\n\nLet's denote the initial ground state wavefunction as ψ1(x) and the new ground state wavefunction as ψ2(x). The initial ground state wavefunction in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of width L is given by:\n\nψ1(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(πx/L)\n\nWhen the width of the well is doubled, the new width is 2L. The new ground state wavefunction is given by:\n\nψ2(x) = sqrt(1/(2L)) * sin(πx/(2L))\n\nNow, we need to find the overlap between these two wavefunctions. This is given by the square of the inner product of the two wavefunctions:\n\nP = |<ψ1(x)|ψ2(x)>|^2\n\nTo find the inner product, we need to integrate the product of the two wavefunctions over the entire width of the well:\n\n<ψ1(x)|ψ2(x)> = ∫[ψ1(x) * ψ2(x)] dx from 0 to L\n\n<ψ1(x)|ψ2(x)> = ∫[sqrt(2/L) * sin(πx/L) * sqrt(1/(2L)) * sin(πx/(2L))] dx from 0 to L\n\nLet's simplify the expression:\n\n<ψ1(x)|ψ2(x)> = (1/L) * ∫[sin(πx/L) * sin(πx/(2L))] dx from 0 to L\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the product-to-sum trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(A)sin(B) = 1/2 * [cos(A-B) - cos(A+B)]\n\nApplying this identity, we get:\n\n<ψ1(x)|ψ2(x)> = (1/L) * ∫[1/2 * (cos(πx/L - πx/(2L)) - cos(πx/L + πx/(2L)))] dx from 0 to L\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\n<ψ1(x)|ψ2(x)> = (1/2L) * [∫cos(πx/L - πx/(2L)) dx - ∫cos(πx/L + πx/(2L)) dx] from 0 to L\n\nIntegrating the cosine terms, we get:\n\n<ψ1(x)|ψ2(x)> = (1/2L) * [ (2L/π) * sin(πx/L - πx/(2L)) - (2L/3π) * sin(πx/L + πx/(2L)) ] from 0 to L\n\nEvaluating the integral at the limits, we get:\n\n<ψ1(x)|ψ2(x)> = (1/2) * [sin(0) - sin(π) - (1/3) * (sin(2π) - sin(0))]\n\n<ψ1(x)|ψ2(x)> = (1/2) * [0 - 0 - (1/3) * (0 - 0)]\n\n<ψ1(x)|ψ2(x)> = 0\n\nSince the inner product is zero, the probability of finding the particle in the ground state after the potential is changed is:\n\nP = |<ψ1(x)|ψ2(x)>|^2 = 0^2 = 0\n\nSo, the probability of finding the particle in the ground state after the potential is changed is 0."
