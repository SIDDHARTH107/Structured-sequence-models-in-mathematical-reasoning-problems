    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations and restrictions. The word MISSISSIPPI has 11 letters, with 4 S's, 4 I's, 2 P's, and 1 M.\n\nFirst, let's arrange the 4 S's such that no two S's are adjacent. We can place them in the following way:\n\n_S_S_S_S_\n\nThere are 5 spaces between and around the S's where we can place the remaining letters. \n\nNow, let's place the 4 I's. We have 5 spaces to place them, and we need to choose 4 of those spaces. This can be done in C(5, 4) ways, where C(n, k) represents the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items. \n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5\n\nNow, we have the following arrangement:\n\nIS_IS_IS_IS\n\nThere are now 6 spaces (including the ends) to place the remaining 3 letters (2 P's and 1 M). \n\nFirst, let's place the M. We have 6 spaces to place it, so there are 6 ways to place the M.\n\nNow, we have 2 P's left to place, and there are 7 spaces available (including the ends). We need to choose 2 of those spaces to place the P's. This can be done in C(7, 2) ways:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = 21\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI such that no two identical letters are adjacent is:\n\n5 (ways to place I's) * 6 (ways to place M) * 21 (ways to place P's) = 630 ways."
