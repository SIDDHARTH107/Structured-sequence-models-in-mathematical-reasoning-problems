    "message_1": "In a Bertrand competition, there are two firms selling the same product with identical production costs. The market demand for the product is given by the function Q = 100 - P, where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price charged by each firm. What price should each firm charge to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "In a Bertrand competition, firms compete by setting prices, and consumers buy from the firm with the lowest price. If both firms charge the same price, they split the market demand equally. Let's denote the price charged by firm 1 as P1 and the price charged by firm 2 as P2.\n\nSince both firms have identical production costs, let's denote the marginal cost (MC) as C. The profit for each firm is given by the product of the quantity sold (Q) and the difference between the price charged (P) and the marginal cost (C).\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium in this Bertrand competition, we need to find the prices P1 and P2 that maximize each firm's profit, given the other firm's price.\n\nIf P1 < P2, firm 1 captures the entire market demand, and its profit is given by:\n\nProfit1 = (100 - P1)(P1 - C)\n\nIf P1 = P2, both firms split the market demand equally, and each firm's profit is given by:\n\nProfit1 = Profit2 = (1/2)(100 - P1)(P1 - C)\n\nIf P1 > P2, firm 2 captures the entire market demand, and its profit is given by:\n\nProfit2 = (100 - P2)(P2 - C)\n\nTo maximize profits, each firm will set its price equal to its marginal cost, as any price above the marginal cost will result in the other firm undercutting it and capturing the entire market demand.\n\nTherefore, P1 = P2 = C.\n\nIn this case, both firms charge the same price equal to their marginal cost, and they split the market demand equally. The Nash equilibrium price for both firms to maximize their profits is the price equal to their identical production costs, C."
