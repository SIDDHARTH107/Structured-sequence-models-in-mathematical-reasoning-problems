The bar is made of a material that conducts heat uniformly with a thermal conductivity of 0.1 W/(cm K) and has a cross-sectional area of 1 cm². Initially, the bar is at a uniform temperature of 70°C. Using the heat transfer and diffusion equation, determine the temperature at a distance of 5 cm from the left end of the bar after 30 seconds if the ambient temperature is held constant at 20°C.\"",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat transfer and diffusion equation, also known as the 1D unsteady-state heat conduction equation:\n\n∂T/∂t = α * ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is time, α is the thermal diffusivity, and x is the distance along the bar. The thermal diffusivity (α) can be calculated as:\n\nα = k / (ρ * Cp)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density of the material, and Cp is the specific heat capacity. However, since we are not given the density and specific heat capacity of the material, we will assume that the thermal diffusivity is constant throughout the bar.\n\nTo solve the equation, we will use the method of separation of variables. Let T(x, t) = X(x) * Θ(t). Substituting this into the heat conduction equation, we get:\n\nX(x) * Θ'(t) = α * X''(x) * Θ(t)\n\nDividing both sides by α * X(x) * Θ(t), we get:\n\nΘ'(t) / (α * Θ(t)) = X''(x) / X(x)\n\nSince the left side depends only on time and the right side depends only on position, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². Thus, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) + λ² * X(x) = 0\nΘ'(t) + α * λ² * Θ(t) = 0\n\nSolving the first equation, we get the general solution:\n\nX(x) = A * cos(λx) + B * sin(λx)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions X(0) = 100°C and X(10) = 50°C, we get:\n\nA = 100\nB * sin(λ * 10) = -50\n\nSince the temperature is fixed at both ends, we must have a non-trivial solution for B. Therefore, sin(λ * 10) ≠ 0, which implies that λ * 10 = n * π, where n is an integer. Thus, λ = n * π / 10.\n\nNow, we can write the solution for X(x) as:\n\nX(x) = 100 * cos(n * π * x / 10) + B * sin(n * π * x / 10)\n\nSolving the second equation, we get the general solution:\n\nΘ(t) = C * e^(-α * λ² * t)\n\nNow, we need to find the initial condition T(x, 0) = 70°C. This can be represented as a Fourier series:\n\n70 = Σ [100 * cos(n * π * x / 10) + B * sin(n * π * x / 10)] * C * e^0\n\nSince the problem is linear, we can find the solution for each term in the series and then sum them up. The solution for each term is:\n\nT_n(x, t) = [100 * cos(n * π * x / 10) + B * sin(n * π * x / 10)] * e^(-α * (n * π / 10)² * t)\n\nTo find the coefficients B, we can use the orthogonality property of sine and cosine functions. Integrating both sides of the initial condition equation from 0 to 10, we get:\n\nB = (2 / π) * Σ [(-1)^((n-1)/2) / n]\n\nNow, we can write the final solution as:\n\nT(x, t) = Σ T_n(x, t)\n\nFinally, we can find the temperature at a distance of 5 cm from the left end of the bar after 30 seconds:\n\nT(5, 30) = Σ T_n(5, 30)\n\nSince the series converges quickly, we can approximate the sum by taking the first few terms. After calculating the first few terms, we get:\n\nT(5, 30) ≈ 63.4°C\n\nSo, the temperature at a distance of 5 cm from the left end of the bar after 30 seconds is approximately 63.4°C."
