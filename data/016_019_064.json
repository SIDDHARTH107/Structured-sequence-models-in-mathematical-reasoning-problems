    "message_2": "A Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is generated by iterating a simple rule: divide the line segment into three equal parts, and replace the middle third with an equilateral triangle with sides equal to the length of the middle third, then remove the base of the new triangle (the middle third of the original line segment).\n\nAfter each iteration, the number of line segments in the Koch curve increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced to 1/3 of the previous length. \n\nLet's find the perimeter of the Koch island after 3 iterations:\n\nIteration 1:\nNumber of segments: 3 * 4 = 12\nLength of each segment: 50 / 3\n\nIteration 2:\nNumber of segments: 12 * 4 = 48\nLength of each segment: (50 / 3) / 3 = 50 / 9\n\nIteration 3:\nNumber of segments: 48 * 4 = 192\nLength of each segment: (50 / 9) / 3 = 50 / 27\n\nNow, we can calculate the perimeter of the Koch island after 3 iterations:\n\nPerimeter = Number of segments * Length of each segment\nPerimeter = 192 * (50 / 27)\nPerimeter = 9600 / 27 â‰ˆ 355.56 units"
