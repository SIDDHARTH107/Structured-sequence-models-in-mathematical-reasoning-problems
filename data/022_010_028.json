    "message_2": "To find the Laurent series expansion for the function f(z) = 1/(z^2 + 2z + 1) centered at the point z = -1, we first rewrite the function in terms of (z + 1):\n\nf(z) = 1/((z + 1)^2)\n\nNow, we want to find the Laurent series expansion of this function. Since the function has a simple pole at z = -1, we can use the geometric series formula to find the expansion. Let w = z + 1, then:\n\nf(w) = 1/w^2\n\nWe want to find a series representation of the form:\n\nf(w) = a_(-1) * w^(-1) + a_(-2) * w^(-2) + ...\n\nSince f(w) = 1/w^2, we can see that a_(-2) = 1 and all other coefficients are 0. So, the Laurent series expansion of f(w) is:\n\nf(w) = w^(-2)\n\nNow, we substitute back z + 1 for w:\n\nf(z) = (z + 1)^(-2)\n\nThis is the Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) centered at z = -1.\n\nNow, let's determine the convergence of the series in the annulus 0 < |z - (-1)| < 2. Since the Laurent series expansion we found is a simple power series, it converges everywhere in its domain. In this case, the domain is the annulus 0 < |z + 1| < 2, which is the same as 0 < |z - (-1)| < 2.\n\nTherefore, the Laurent series expansion converges in the annulus 0 < |z - (-1)| < 2."
