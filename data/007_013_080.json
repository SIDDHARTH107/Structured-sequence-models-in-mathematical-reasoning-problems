    "message_2": "The Goldbach Conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This conjecture has been tested extensively for even integers up to very large values, and it holds true for all tested cases. However, it has not been proven or disproven for all even integers. \n\nAs a mathematician, I cannot provide you with the smallest even integer greater than 2 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, because no such number has been found or proven to exist."
