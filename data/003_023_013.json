    "message_2": "First, we need to find the vector representing the line segment AB. To do this, we subtract the coordinates of point A from the coordinates of point B.\n\nVector AB = (6 - (-4), 5 - 3) = (10, 2)\n\nNow, we have the vector AB = (10, 2) and the vector u = (3, -2). To find the cross product of these two vectors in 2D, we can treat them as 3D vectors with a z-component of 0. So, AB = (10, 2, 0) and u = (3, -2, 0).\n\nThe cross product of two 3D vectors (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3) is given by:\n\n(a2 * b3 - a3 * b2, a3 * b1 - a1 * b3, a1 * b2 - a2 * b1)\n\nApplying this formula to our vectors AB and u, we get:\n\n(2 * 0 - 0 * (-2), 0 * 3 - 10 * 0, 10 * (-2) - 2 * 3)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(0, 0, -20)\n\nSince we are working in 2D, we can ignore the z-component and report the cross product as a scalar value:\n\nCross product of AB and u = -20"
