    "message_1": "A car dealership wants to determine the average fuel consumption of its vehicles. It plans to take a random sample of 50 cars from their inventory for this purpose. If the standard deviation of fuel consumption for all the cars in the inventory is 4.5 liters per 100 km, what is the probability that the sample mean fuel consumption is within 1 liter per 100 km of the true population mean?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean (μ) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the sample size (n).\n\nIn this case, we have:\n- Population standard deviation (σ) = 4.5 liters per 100 km\n- Sample size (n) = 50 cars\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean, which is also known as the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n\nSE = 4.5 / √50 ≈ 0.6364 liters per 100 km\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the sample mean is within 1 liter per 100 km of the true population mean. This can be represented as:\n\nP(μ - 1 ≤ X̄ ≤ μ + 1)\n\nTo find this probability, we need to convert the range to a Z-score, which represents the number of standard errors away from the population mean:\n\nZ = (X̄ - μ) / SE\n\nFor the lower bound (μ - 1):\n\nZ_lower = (μ - 1 - μ) / SE = -1 / 0.6364 ≈ -1.571\n\nFor the upper bound (μ + 1):\n\nZ_upper = (μ + 1 - μ) / SE = 1 / 0.6364 ≈ 1.571\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the Z-score falls between -1.571 and 1.571. We can use a Z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find the area under the curve between these Z-scores.\n\nUsing a Z-table or calculator, we find:\n\nP(-1.571 ≤ Z ≤ 1.571) ≈ 0.8834\n\nSo, there is approximately an 88.34% probability that the sample mean fuel consumption is within 1 liter per 100 km of the true population mean."
