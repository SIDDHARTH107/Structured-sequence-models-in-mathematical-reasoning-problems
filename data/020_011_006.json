    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, products A and B. Each unit of product A requires 5 hours of labor and 3 hours of machine time; each unit of product B requires 2 hours of labor and 7 hours of machine time. The company has 300 hours of labor and 420 hours of machine time available each week. The profit per unit of product A is $50, and the profit per unit of product B is $70. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit, and what is the maximum profit that the company can make?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B.\n\nThe labor constraint can be written as:\n5x + 2y ≤ 300 (1)\n\nThe machine time constraint can be written as:\n3x + 7y ≤ 420 (2)\n\nThe profit function to be maximized is:\nP = 50x + 70y\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n(1) can be rewritten as y ≤ (300 - 5x)/2\n(2) can be rewritten as y ≤ (420 - 3x)/7\n\nThe feasible region is determined by the intersection of these inequalities. To find the corner points of the feasible region, we'll solve the equations for the boundary lines:\n\n1) x = 0: \ny = (300 - 5(0))/2 = 150\ny = (420 - 3(0))/7 = 60\n\n2) y = 0:\nx = (300 - 2(0))/5 = 60\nx = (420 - 7(0))/3 = 140\n\n3) Intersection of the boundary lines:\n5x + 2y = 300\n3x + 7y = 420\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\nx = 36\ny = 42\n\nSo, the corner points of the feasible region are (0, 60), (60, 0), and (36, 42).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function at each of these corner points:\n\nP(0, 60) = 50(0) + 70(60) = $4,200\nP(60, 0) = 50(60) + 70(0) = $3,000\nP(36, 42) = 50(36) + 70(42) = $1,800 + $2,940 = $4,740\n\nThe maximum profit of $4,740 occurs when the company produces 36 units of product A and 42 units of product B."
