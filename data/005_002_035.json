    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the true average sleep time of college students, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a sample mean:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (6.8 hours)\nZ = Z-score for the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence level)\nσ = standard deviation (1.2 hours)\nn = sample size (36 students)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = 1.2 / √36 = 1.2 / 6 = 0.2\n\nNow, we can find the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 0.2 = 0.392\n\nFinally, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nCI = x̄ ± ME = 6.8 ± 0.392\n\nLower limit of CI = 6.8 - 0.392 = 6.408 hours\nUpper limit of CI = 6.8 + 0.392 = 7.192 hours\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval for the true average sleep time of college students is (6.408 hours, 7.192 hours)."
