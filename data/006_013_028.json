    "message_1": "A coastal region has historically experienced a hurricane once every 10 years, and a tsunami once every 20 years. What is the probability of this region experiencing either a hurricane or a tsunami in the next year?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of either a hurricane or a tsunami occurring in the next year, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A is the event of a hurricane, B is the event of a tsunami, and P(A ∩ B) is the probability of both events occurring.\n\nFirst, we need to find the individual probabilities of each event occurring in the next year:\n\nP(A) = Probability of a hurricane in the next year = 1/10\nP(B) = Probability of a tsunami in the next year = 1/20\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of both events occurring in the next year. Since the events are independent, we can multiply their individual probabilities:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = (1/10) * (1/20) = 1/200\n\nNow, we can find the probability of either event occurring in the next year:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = (1/10) + (1/20) - (1/200)\nP(A ∪ B) = (20 + 10 - 1) / 200 = 29/200\n\nSo, the probability of this region experiencing either a hurricane or a tsunami in the next year is 29/200, or approximately 0.145 (14.5%)."
