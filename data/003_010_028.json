    "message_1": "A flagpole is standing vertically on a flat ground. The angle of elevation from a point on the ground to the top of the pole is 60°. If the distance between the point and the pole is 20 meters, what is the height of the flagpole in meters?",
    "message_2": "We can use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, the angle of elevation is 60°, the side opposite the angle is the height of the flagpole (which we want to find), and the side adjacent to the angle is the distance between the point and the pole, which is 20 meters.\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 20\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 20:\n\nheight = 20 * tan(60°)\n\nThe tangent of 60° is equal to the square root of 3:\n\nheight = 20 * √3\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of the height:\n\nheight ≈ 20 * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 34.64 meters\n\nTherefore, the height of the flagpole is approximately 34.64 meters."
