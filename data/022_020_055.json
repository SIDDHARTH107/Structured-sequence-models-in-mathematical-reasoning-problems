    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution can be written as a product of functions of x and y, i.e., $u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Then, we can rewrite the given partial differential equation as:\n\n$X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $X(x)Y(y)$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = 0$\n\nSince the left side depends only on x and the right side depends only on y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$\n\n$\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = \\lambda^2$\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$\n\n$Y''(y) - \\lambda^2 Y(y) = 0$\n\nSolve the first equation for X(x):\n\nSince the boundary conditions are $u(0,y) = 0$ and $u(1,y) = 0$, we have $X(0) = 0$ and $X(1) = 0$. The general solution of the first equation is:\n\n$X(x) = A\\sin(\\lambda x) + B\\cos(\\lambda x)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions, we get:\n\n$X(0) = B = 0$\n\n$X(1) = A\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$\n\nSince A cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\sin(\\lambda) = 0$. Thus, $\\lambda = n\\pi$ for some integer n.\n\nNow, solve the second equation for Y(y):\n\nThe general solution of the second equation is:\n\n$Y(y) = C\\cosh(n\\pi y) + D\\sinh(n\\pi y)$\n\nApplying the boundary conditions $u(x,0) = x$ and $u(x,1) = 1-x$, we get:\n\n$Y(0) = C = x$\n\n$Y(1) = C\\cosh(n\\pi) + D\\sinh(n\\pi) = 1-x$\n\nNow, we can write the solution as a sum of solutions for each value of n:\n\n$u(x,y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} X_n(x)Y_n(y)$\n\n$u(x,y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)(x\\cosh(n\\pi y) + (1-x)\\sinh(n\\pi y))$\n\nTo find the coefficients $A_n$, we can use the orthogonality property of sine functions and the boundary condition $u(x,0) = x$:\n\n$x = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\sin(m\\pi x)$ and integrating from 0 to 1, we get:\n\n$\\int_0^1 x\\sin(m\\pi x) dx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n \\int_0^1 \\sin(n\\pi x)\\sin(m\\pi x) dx$\n\nUsing the orthogonality property, the right side becomes:\n\n$A_m \\int_0^1 \\sin^2(m\\pi x) dx$\n\nNow, we can find $A_m$:\n\n$A_m = \\frac{\\int_0^1 x\\sin(m\\pi x) dx}{\\int_0^1 \\sin^2(m\\pi x) dx}$\n\nIntegrating and simplifying, we get:\n\n$A_m = \\frac{2}{m\\pi}(-1)^{m+1}$\n\nFinally, the solution to the boundary value problem is:\n\n$u(x,y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{n\\pi}(-1)^{n+1}\\sin(n\\pi x)(x\\cosh(n\\pi y) + (1-x)\\sinh(n\\pi y))$"
