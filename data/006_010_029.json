    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a sample of 100 individuals belonging to a certain demographic group, at least 4 individuals will be affected by a certain disease if the prevalence rate of the disease in the population is 5%?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k individuals affected by the disease\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the sample size (100 individuals in this case)\n- k is the number of individuals affected by the disease (we want at least 4)\n- p is the prevalence rate of the disease (5% or 0.05)\n\nSince we want the probability of at least 4 individuals being affected, we can find the probability of 0, 1, 2, and 3 individuals being affected and subtract that from 1:\n\nP(X ≥ 4) = 1 - P(X = 0) - P(X = 1) - P(X = 2) - P(X = 3)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probabilities for each case:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0) = 1 * 1 * 0.95^100 ≈ 0.00592\n\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1) = 100 * 0.05 * 0.95^99 ≈ 0.03116\n\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2) = 4950 * 0.0025 * 0.95^98 ≈ 0.08118\n\nP(X = 3) = C(100, 3) * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(100-3) = 161700 * 0.000125 * 0.95^97 ≈ 0.13956\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 4 individuals being affected:\n\nP(X ≥ 4) = 1 - 0.00592 - 0.03116 - 0.08118 - 0.13956 ≈ 1 - 0.25782 ≈ 0.74218\n\nSo, the probability that at least 4 individuals out of 100 will be affected by the disease is approximately 74.22%."
