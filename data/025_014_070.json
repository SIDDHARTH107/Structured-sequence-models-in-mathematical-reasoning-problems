    "message_2": "To compute the value of the Riemann theta function $\\theta(z)$ at $z = \\frac{1}{2}$, we can use the definition of the function and evaluate the sum:\n\n$$\\theta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i n^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}$$\n\nSince the sum is over all integers, we can split it into two parts: one for negative integers and one for positive integers. We can also note that the function is symmetric around $n=0$, so we can just compute the sum for positive integers and multiply by 2:\n\n$$\\theta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} e^{\\pi i n^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the sum numerically up to a certain number of terms, say $N$, and check the convergence. For example, let's compute the sum up to $N=100$:\n\n$$\\theta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\approx 2\\sum_{n=1}^{100} e^{\\pi i n^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}$$\n\nUsing a computer or calculator to compute the sum, we get:\n\n$$\\theta\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\approx 2\\sum_{n=1}^{100} e^{\\pi i n^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} \\approx 1.6723$$\n\nThis value is correct to four decimal places. Note that increasing the number of terms in the sum will improve the accuracy of the approximation, but the convergence of the sum is quite slow."
