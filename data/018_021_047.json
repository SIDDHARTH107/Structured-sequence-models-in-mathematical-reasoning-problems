    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of the sets A and B. The symmetric difference (A ∆ B) consists of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. \n\nA ∆ B = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10}\n\nNow, let's find the result of (A ∆ B) ∩ A using the distributivity law. The intersection of (A ∆ B) and A consists of elements that are in both (A ∆ B) and A.\n\n(A ∆ B) ∩ A = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNext, let's find A ∩ B, which consists of elements that are in both A and B.\n\nA ∩ B = {2, 4}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of A ∩ B and A ∩ B.\n\n(A ∩ B) ∆ (A ∩ B) = {} (empty set)\n\nSince the symmetric difference of two identical sets is always an empty set, the result is an empty set."
