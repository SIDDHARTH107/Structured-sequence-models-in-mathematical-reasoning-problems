    "message_1": "In the Ultimatum Game, player A is given $100 and is tasked with splitting the money with player B. Player B must either accept or reject the offer. If player B accepts, the money is split as proposed. If player B rejects, neither player gets any money. What is the maximum amount that Player A can offer to Player B so that Player B is still likely to accept the offer? Assume that Player B will accept the offer if it is at least $30.",
    "message_2": "If Player B is likely to accept the offer as long as it is at least $30, then the maximum amount Player A can offer to Player B is $70. This would leave Player A with $30. If Player A offers more than $70 to Player B, they would be left with less than $30, which is not optimal for Player A. So, the maximum amount Player A can offer to Player B while still having the offer likely to be accepted is $70."
