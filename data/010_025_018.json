If the induced map f*_#: H*_n(B; ℤ) → H*_n(A; ℤ) is surjective for all n, show that f is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nCan you prove that f is a homotopy equivalence? If yes, find the homotopy inverse for f. If no, give a counterexample.",
    "message_2": "To show that f is a homotopy equivalence, we need to find a continuous map g: B → A such that g ∘ f is homotopic to the identity map on A, and f ∘ g is homotopic to the identity map on B.\n\nSince f*_# is surjective for all n, by the Whitehead theorem, f is a homotopy equivalence. Now we need to find the homotopy inverse for f.\n\nConsider the mapping cylinder M(f) of f, which is the quotient space (A × [0, 1]) ⋃_f B, where (a, 0) ~ f(a) for all a in A. Let p: A × [0, 1] → M(f) be the quotient map. Since A is simply-connected and smooth, it is locally contractible. Therefore, by the theorem of locally contractible spaces, M(f) is also simply-connected.\n\nNow, consider the long exact sequence of the pair (M(f), A × {1}):\n\n→ H_n(A × {1}; ℤ) → H_n(M(f); ℤ) → H_n(M(f), A × {1}; ℤ) → H_(n-1)(A × {1}; ℤ) → ...\n\nSince f is a homotopy equivalence, we have H_n(M(f); ℤ) ≅ H_n(B; ℤ) and H_n(M(f), A × {1}; ℤ) ≅ H_n(A; ℤ). Thus, the long exact sequence becomes:\n\n→ H_n(A; ℤ) → H_n(B; ℤ) → H_n(A; ℤ) → H_(n-1)(A; ℤ) → ...\n\nNow, let g': B → A × [0, 1] be the map g'(b) = (g(b), 1), where g is the desired homotopy inverse. Define g*: M(f) → A as the composition g* = p^(-1) ∘ g', where p^(-1) is the right inverse of p. Since p is a quotient map and g' is continuous, g* is continuous.\n\nNow, we have g* ∘ f = p^(-1) ∘ g' ∘ f = p^(-1) ∘ (g ∘ f, 1) = id_A × 1, which is homotopic to the identity map on A. Similarly, f ∘ g* = f ∘ p^(-1) ∘ g' = f ∘ (g, 1) = id_B × 1, which is homotopic to the identity map on B.\n\nThus, g* is the desired homotopy inverse for f, and f is a homotopy equivalence."
