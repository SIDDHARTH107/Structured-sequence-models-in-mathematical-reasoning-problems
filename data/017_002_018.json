    "message_2": "Proof that H is cyclic:\n\nLet H be a subgroup of G. Since G is cyclic, every element in G can be written in the form $a^k$ for some integer k. Now, consider the set of all positive integers n such that $a^n \\in H$. Since H is non-empty (it contains the identity element), this set is non-empty. By the Well-Ordering Principle, there exists a smallest positive integer, say m, such that $a^m \\in H$.\n\nWe claim that H is generated by $a^m$, i.e., $H = \\langle a^m \\rangle$. To prove this, let $h \\in H$. Since h is an element of G, we can write $h = a^k$ for some integer k. By the division algorithm, we can write $k = mq + r$, where q and r are integers and $0 \\leq r < m$. Then, $a^k = a^{mq+r} = (a^m)^q a^r$. Since $a^m \\in H$, we have that $(a^m)^q \\in H$ (because H is a subgroup). Thus, $(a^m)^q a^r \\in H$.\n\nNow, we have $h = a^k = (a^m)^q a^r \\in H$. Since $(a^m)^q \\in H$, we have that $(a^m)^{-q} \\in H$. Multiplying both sides by $(a^m)^{-q}$, we get $(a^m)^{-q} h = a^r \\in H$. But $0 \\leq r < m$, and m is the smallest positive integer such that $a^m \\in H$. Thus, we must have $r = 0$, which implies that $h = (a^m)^q$. This shows that every element of H can be written as a power of $a^m$, so $H = \\langle a^m \\rangle$. Hence, H is cyclic, and $a^m$ is a generator of H.\n\nNow, let H be the subgroup of G generated by $a^3$. To find a generator of H, we can follow the same argument as above. Since $a^3 \\in H$, the smallest positive integer m such that $a^m \\in H$ is 3. Therefore, H is generated by $a^3$, i.e., $H = \\langle a^3 \\rangle$."
