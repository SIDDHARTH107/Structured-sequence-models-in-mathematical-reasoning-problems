    "message_2": "In relevance logic, a statement is relevant to another statement if there is a meaningful connection between them. We are given that P is relevant to Q, and Q is relevant to R. We want to determine if P is relevant to R.\n\nTo prove this, we can use the transitivity of relevance. Transitivity states that if A is relevant to B, and B is relevant to C, then A is relevant to C.\n\nLet A = P, B = Q, and C = R.\n\nSince P is relevant to Q (A is relevant to B) and Q is relevant to R (B is relevant to C), by the transitivity of relevance, P is relevant to R (A is relevant to C).\n\nTherefore, P is relevant to R in relevance logic."
