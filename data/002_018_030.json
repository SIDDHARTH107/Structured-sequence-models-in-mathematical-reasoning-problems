    "message_2": "A sphere inscribed in a cube will have its diameter equal to the edge length of the cube. In this case, the diameter of the sphere is 10 cm. The radius of the sphere will be half of the diameter, which is 5 cm.\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nSubstituting the given radius into the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)π(5)^3\nV = (4/3)π(125)\nV = (500/3)π\n\nApproximating the value of π:\n\nV ≈ (500/3) * 3.14159\nV ≈ 523.598\n\nSo, the volume of the sphere inscribed in the cube is approximately 523.598 cubic centimeters."
