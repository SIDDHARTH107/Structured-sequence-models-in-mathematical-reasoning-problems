    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2 on the interval [0, 4], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it:\n\n3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\n3(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\nThe critical points are x = 1 and x = 3.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(0) = (0)^3 - 6(0)^2 + 9(0) + 2 = 2\nf(1) = (1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 9(1) + 2 = 1 - 6 + 9 + 2 = 6\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 6(3)^2 + 9(3) + 2 = 27 - 54 + 27 + 2 = 2\nf(4) = (4)^3 - 6(4)^2 + 9(4) + 2 = 64 - 96 + 36 + 2 = 6\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints, we find that the maximum value is 6, which occurs at x = 1 and x = 4, and the minimum value is 2, which occurs at x = 0 and x = 3."
