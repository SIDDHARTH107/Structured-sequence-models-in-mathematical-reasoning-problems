    "message_2": "The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method to find the roots of a real-valued function. The formula for the method is:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nwhere x0 is the initial guess, f(x) is the function, and f'(x) is the derivative of the function.\n\nGiven the function f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x - 1, let's first find its derivative:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 3\n\nNow, let's apply the Newton-Raphson method with the initial guess x0 = 2:\n\nx1 = 2 - (f(2) / f'(2))\n\nFirst, we need to calculate f(2) and f'(2):\n\nf(2) = (2)^3 - 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 1 = 8 - 8 + 6 - 1 = 5\nf'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 4(2) + 3 = 12 - 8 + 3 = 7\n\nNow, we can calculate x1:\n\nx1 = 2 - (5 / 7) = 2 - 0.714 = 1.286\n\nNow, let's iterate the method one more time to get a more accurate result:\n\nx2 = x1 - (f(x1) / f'(x1))\n\nFirst, we need to calculate f(1.286) and f'(1.286):\n\nf(1.286) ≈ (1.286)^3 - 2(1.286)^2 + 3(1.286) - 1 ≈ 0.104\nf'(1.286) ≈ 3(1.286)^2 - 4(1.286) + 3 ≈ 3.758\n\nNow, we can calculate x2:\n\nx2 = 1.286 - (0.104 / 3.758) ≈ 1.286 - 0.028 ≈ 1.258\n\nWe can continue iterating the method to get more accurate results, but since we need to round the answer to three decimal places, x2 = 1.258 is sufficient. Therefore, the solution to the equation f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x - 1 using the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of x0 = 2 is approximately x = 1.258."
