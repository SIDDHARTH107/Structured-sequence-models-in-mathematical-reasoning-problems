    "message_1": "Consider the sets A = {1, 2} and B = {3}, find (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) and verify that the Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative with respect to union.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian products A × B and B × A:\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (2, 3)}\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of these Cartesian products:\n\n(A × B) ∪ (B × A) = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n(B × A) ∪ (A × B) = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}\n\nAs we can see, (A × B) ∪ (B × A) and (B × A) ∪ (A × B) are equal, both containing the same elements. However, this does not imply that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union, as the question seems to assume.\n\nThe Cartesian product itself is not commutative, as A × B ≠ B × A in general. The union operation is commutative, meaning that (A × B) ∪ (B × A) = (B × A) ∪ (A × B), but this does not imply that the Cartesian product is commutative with respect to union. The question's assumption is incorrect."
