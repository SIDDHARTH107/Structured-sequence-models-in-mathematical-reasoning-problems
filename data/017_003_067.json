    "message_2": "To prove that G is cyclic, we need to show that there exists an element g in G such that every element of G can be expressed as a power of g. In other words, we need to find a generator for G.\n\nSince G has prime order 13, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in G must divide 13. Since 13 is prime, the order of any non-identity element must be 13.\n\nLet g be any non-identity element in G. Then the order of g is 13, which means that the set {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^12} contains 13 distinct elements. Since G has 13 elements, this set must be equal to G. Therefore, every element in G can be expressed as a power of g, and G is cyclic with generator g."
