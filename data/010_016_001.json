    "message_2": "To find the number of intersection points of two generic curves of degrees 3 and 4 on a closed orientable surface of genus 2, we can use the intersection number formula:\n\nIntersection number = (Degree of curve 1) * (Degree of curve 2) * (Euler characteristic of the surface)\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a closed orientable surface of genus g is given by the formula:\n\nEuler characteristic = 2 - 2g\n\nFor a surface of genus 2, the Euler characteristic is:\n\nEuler characteristic = 2 - 2(2) = 2 - 4 = -2\n\nNow, we can find the intersection number:\n\nIntersection number = (3) * (4) * (-2) = -24\n\nHowever, the intersection number cannot be negative, as it represents the number of intersection points. This indicates that the intersection number formula is not directly applicable in this case.\n\nInstead, we can consider the curves as being embedded in a higher genus surface, where the intersection number formula is valid. For example, we can consider the curves to be embedded in a surface of genus 3. In this case, the Euler characteristic of the surface is:\n\nEuler characteristic = 2 - 2(3) = 2 - 6 = -4\n\nNow, we can find the intersection number:\n\nIntersection number = (3) * (4) * (-4) = -48\n\nHowever, this intersection number is still negative, which is not possible. This suggests that the intersection number formula is not applicable in this case, and we cannot directly determine the number of intersection points of two generic curves of degrees 3 and 4 on a closed orientable surface of genus 2 using this method.\n\nIn conclusion, the intersection number formula does not provide a valid result for this problem, and we cannot determine the number of intersection points of two generic curves of degrees 3 and 4 on a closed orientable surface of genus 2 using this method."
