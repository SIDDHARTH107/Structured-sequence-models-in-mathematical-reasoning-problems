    "message_1": "On average, a certain stock has a daily return of 1.2% with a standard deviation of 0.8%. What is the probability that the stock's return will be greater than 2.5% on a given day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the stock's return and then use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for (2.5% in this case), μ is the mean (1.2%), and σ is the standard deviation (0.8%).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the percentages to decimals:\n\nX = 0.025\nμ = 0.012\nσ = 0.008\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the z-score formula:\n\nz = (0.025 - 0.012) / 0.008\nz ≈ 1.625\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can use the z-table to find the probability. A z-score of 1.625 corresponds to a probability of approximately 0.9474. This means that there is a 94.74% chance that the stock's return will be less than 2.5% on a given day.\n\nTo find the probability that the stock's return will be greater than 2.5%, we can subtract the probability we found from 1:\n\nProbability (return > 2.5%) = 1 - 0.9474\nProbability (return > 2.5%) ≈ 0.0526\n\nSo, there is approximately a 5.26% chance that the stock's return will be greater than 2.5% on a given day."
