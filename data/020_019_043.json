    "message_1": "A drone can carry a maximum payload of 10 kilograms. The power consumption of the drone is proportional to the payload weight. Specifically, the power consumption is given by the function P(x) = 5x + 75, where x is the weight of the payload. In order to minimize energy consumption and maximize payload delivery, what is the optimal weight of the payload that the drone should carry?",
    "message_2": "To minimize energy consumption and maximize payload delivery, the drone should carry the maximum payload weight it can handle, which is 10 kilograms. This is because the power consumption increases linearly with the payload weight, and carrying the maximum payload weight will result in fewer trips and overall less energy consumption for the same amount of payload delivered."
