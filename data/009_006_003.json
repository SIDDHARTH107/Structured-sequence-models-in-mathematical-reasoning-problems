    "message_1": "Consider a chemical reaction where the concentration of reactant A changes with time t according to the equation: \n\nd[A]/dt = -0.02[A]^2, \n\nwhere [A] is the concentration of A in moles per liter. \n\nIf the initial concentration of A is 0.1 M, what is the concentration of A after 5 minutes?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to integrate the given differential equation. \n\nd[A]/dt = -0.02[A]^2\n\nRearrange the equation to separate variables:\n\nd[A]/[A]^2 = -0.02 dt\n\nNow, integrate both sides of the equation:\n\n∫(1/[A]^2) d[A] = ∫(-0.02) dt\n\nThe integral of 1/[A]^2 with respect to [A] is -1/[A], and the integral of -0.02 with respect to t is -0.02t. So, we have:\n\n-1/[A] = -0.02t + C\n\nNow, we need to find the constant of integration, C. We know that at t = 0, [A] = 0.1 M. Plug these values into the equation:\n\n-1/0.1 = -0.02(0) + C\n\nC = -10\n\nNow, we have the equation:\n\n-1/[A] = -0.02t - 10\n\nWe want to find the concentration of A after 5 minutes (300 seconds):\n\n-1/[A] = -0.02(300) - 10\n\n-1/[A] = -16\n\nNow, solve for [A]:\n\n[A] = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the concentration of A after 5 minutes is 1/16 M, or approximately 0.0625 M."
