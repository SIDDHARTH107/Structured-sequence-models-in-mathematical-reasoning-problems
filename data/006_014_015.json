    "message_1": "A company produces a certain type of computer software that has a 0.05% chance of crashing on startup. If the company produces 10,000 copies of the software, what is the probability that at least one of them will crash on startup?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that none of the 10,000 copies will crash on startup, and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one will crash.\n\nThe probability that a single copy does not crash on startup is 1 - 0.05% = 1 - 0.0005 = 0.9995.\n\nFor 10,000 independent copies, the probability that all of them do not crash is (0.9995)^10,000.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that at least one of them will crash, which is the complement of the probability that none of them crash:\n\nP(at least one crash) = 1 - P(no crashes) = 1 - (0.9995)^10,000 â‰ˆ 0.9934 or 99.34%.\n\nSo, there is approximately a 99.34% chance that at least one of the 10,000 copies will crash on startup."
