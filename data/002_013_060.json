    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a rectangular base of length 6cm and width 4cm. The height of the pyramid is 10cm. Calculate the volume of the pyramid.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the volume of a rectangular pyramid, you can use the following formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nThe base area can be calculated by multiplying the length and width of the rectangular base:\n\nBase Area = Length * Width = 6cm * 4cm = 24cm²\n\nNow, we can plug the base area and height into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 24cm² * 10cm = (1/3) * 240cm³ = 80cm³\n\nThe volume of the rectangular pyramid is 80 cubic centimeters."
