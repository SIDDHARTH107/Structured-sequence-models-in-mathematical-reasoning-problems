    "message_2": "To solve this system of homogeneous linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, we write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[  2  3 -4 | 0 ]\n[  4  2  1 | 0 ]\n[ -2  5 -3 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 1: Swap row 1 and row 2 to have the largest absolute value in the first column:\n\n```\n[  4  2  1 | 0 ]\n[  2  3 -4 | 0 ]\n[ -2  5 -3 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 2: Add (-1/2) * row 1 to row 2 and add (1/2) * row 1 to row 3:\n\n```\n[  4  2   1  | 0 ]\n[  0  2  -4.5| 0 ]\n[  0  6  -2.5| 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 3: Divide row 2 by 2:\n\n```\n[  4  2   1  | 0 ]\n[  0  1  -2.25| 0 ]\n[  0  6  -2.5 | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 4: Add (-2) * row 2 to row 1 and add (-6) * row 2 to row 3:\n\n```\n[  4  0   5.5 | 0 ]\n[  0  1  -2.25| 0 ]\n[  0  0   11  | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 5: Divide row 3 by 11:\n\n```\n[  4  0   5.5 | 0 ]\n[  0  1  -2.25| 0 ]\n[  0  0   1   | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 6: Add (-5.5) * row 3 to row 1 and add (2.25) * row 3 to row 2:\n\n```\n[  4  0   0   | 0 ]\n[  0  1   0   | 0 ]\n[  0  0   1   | 0 ]\n```\n\nStep 7: Divide row 1 by 4:\n\n```\n[  1  0   0   | 0 ]\n[  0  1   0   | 0 ]\n[  0  0   1   | 0 ]\n```\n\nThe system of equations has a unique solution: x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
