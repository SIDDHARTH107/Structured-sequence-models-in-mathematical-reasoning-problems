    "message_2": "To find the zeros of f(z), we need to find the values of z for which f(z) = 0. Since f(z) = (z^3 - 1)/(z - 1), we need to find the zeros of the numerator:\n\nz^3 - 1 = 0\nz^3 = 1\n\nThis equation has three solutions, which are the cube roots of unity:\n\nz = 1 (1st root of unity)\nz = e^(2πi/3) (2nd root of unity)\nz = e^(4πi/3) (3rd root of unity)\n\nNow, let's find the poles of f(z). The poles are the values of z for which f(z) is undefined, i.e., when the denominator is zero:\n\nz - 1 = 0\nz = 1\n\nHowever, we can see that f(z) has a removable singularity at z = 1, as both the numerator and the denominator have a common factor (z - 1). We can simplify f(z) by factoring out (z - 1) from the numerator:\n\nz^3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1)\n\nSo, f(z) can be simplified as:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + z + 1)\n\nNow, f(z) has no poles, as the simplified expression has no denominator that can be equal to zero.\n\nTo determine the orders of the zeros, we can look at the multiplicity of each zero in the simplified expression. Since the simplified expression is a quadratic polynomial, each zero can have a multiplicity of at most 2. However, in this case, each zero has a multiplicity of 1, as they are distinct and not repeated.\n\nIn summary, f(z) has three zeros:\n\n1. z = 1, order 1\n2. z = e^(2πi/3), order 1\n3. z = e^(4πi/3), order 1\n\nAnd f(z) has no poles."
