    "message_2": "The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 24 and 54 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm or by listing the factors of each number and finding the largest common factor.\n\nFactors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\nFactors of 54: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54\n\nThe largest common factor of 24 and 54 is 6. Therefore, the GCD of 24 and 54 is 6."
