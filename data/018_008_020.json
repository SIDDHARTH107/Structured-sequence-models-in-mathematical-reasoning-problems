    "message_2": "To calculate the Cartesian product A × B, we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from set A and the second element from set B. Similarly, for B × A, we form all possible ordered pairs with the first element from set B and the second element from set A.\n\nA × B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}\n\nB × A = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}\n\nNow, let's compare the two sets A × B and B × A. We can see that the ordered pairs in A × B are not the same as the ordered pairs in B × A. For example, (1, 3) is in A × B but not in B × A, and (3, 1) is in B × A but not in A × B.\n\nTherefore, A × B is not equal to B × A."
