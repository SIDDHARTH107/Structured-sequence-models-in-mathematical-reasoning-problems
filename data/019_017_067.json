    "message_2": "To prove this, we will use the back-and-forth method to show that any model M of T is elementarily equivalent to the model Q = (Q, <), where Q is the set of rational numbers.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of a dense linear order without endpoints. A linear order (M, <) is dense if for any two distinct elements a, b in M with a < b, there exists an element c in M such that a < c < b. It has no endpoints if there is no least or greatest element in M.\n\nNow, let M = (M, <) be any model of T. We will construct a sequence of partial isomorphisms between M and Q. A partial isomorphism is a bijection between two subsets of M and Q that preserves the order.\n\nLet A and B be two disjoint subsets of M and Q, respectively, with A = {a_1, a_2, ...} and B = {b_1, b_2, ...}. We will define a sequence of partial isomorphisms f_n: A_n → B_n, where A_n and B_n are finite subsets of A and B, respectively.\n\n1. Start with f_0 as the empty function.\n2. For each n, extend f_n to f_(n+1) as follows:\n   a. If n is even, pick an element a ∈ M that is not in the domain of f_n.\n      i. If a has no predecessor in M, choose a rational number b ∈ Q with b < f_n(a_i) for all i ≤ n. Then, extend f_n to f_(n+1) by setting f_(n+1)(a) = b.\n      ii. If a has a predecessor a' in M, choose a rational number b ∈ Q with f_n(a') < b < f_n(a_i) for all i ≤ n. Then, extend f_n to f_(n+1) by setting f_(n+1)(a) = b.\n   b. If n is odd, do the same as in step 2a, but with the roles of M and Q reversed.\n\nBy construction, each f_n is a partial isomorphism between M and Q. Moreover, since M and Q are both dense linear orders without endpoints, we can always find suitable elements to extend f_n to f_(n+1).\n\nNow, let f: M → Q be the union of all f_n. By the back-and-forth method, f is an isomorphism between M and Q. Therefore, M is elementarily equivalent to Q. This shows that every model of T has a copy that is elementarily equivalent to the model Q = (Q, <)."
