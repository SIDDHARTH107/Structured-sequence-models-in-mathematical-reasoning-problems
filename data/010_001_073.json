    "message_2": "If A ∩ B = ∅ and A is connected, we can say that B does not intersect with A, and they are disjoint open sets in the topological space X. However, we cannot make any conclusions about the connectedness of B, as it depends on the specific topological space and the properties of B. B could be connected or disconnected, but it is separate from A in the topological space X."
