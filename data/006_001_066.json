    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 5 heads in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads)\n- n is the total number of trials (coin flips)\n- k is the number of successes (heads) we want to find the probability for\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes out of n trials, calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (getting heads) in a single trial, which is 0.5 for a fair coin\n- q is the probability of failure (getting tails) in a single trial, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin\n\nPlugging in the values for our problem:\n\nn = 10 (total coin flips)\nk = 5 (number of heads)\np = 0.5 (probability of getting heads)\nq = 0.5 (probability of getting tails)\n\nP(X = 5) = (10C5) * (0.5^5) * (0.5^(10-5))\n\nFirst, let's calculate 10C5:\n\n10C5 = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n     = 10! / (5!5!)\n     = (10*9*8*7*6) / (5*4*3*2*1)\n     = 252\n\nNow, let's plug this back into the probability formula:\n\nP(X = 5) = 252 * (0.5^5) * (0.5^5)\n         = 252 * 0.03125 * 0.03125\n         = 252 * 0.0009765625\n         ≈ 0.24609375\n\nSo the probability of getting exactly 5 heads in 10 coin flips is approximately 0.2461, or 24.61%."
