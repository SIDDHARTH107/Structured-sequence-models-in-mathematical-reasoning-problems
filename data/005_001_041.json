    "message_1": "A manufacturer of light bulbs claims that their product lasts, on average, 800 hours. You randomly choose a sample of 50 light bulbs and determine their average lifespan to be 780 hours with a standard deviation of 30 hours. \nTest the manufacturer's claim at a 5% significance level. Is there enough evidence to support the claim that the lifespan of the light bulbs is less than 800 hours?",
    "message_2": "To test the manufacturer's claim, we will perform a one-sample t-test. We are given:\n\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 800 hours (the average lifespan of the light bulbs is 800 hours)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ < 800 hours (the average lifespan of the light bulbs is less than 800 hours)\n\nSample size (n) = 50\nSample mean (x̄) = 780 hours\nSample standard deviation (s) = 30 hours\nSignificance level (α) = 0.05\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the t-score. The formula for the t-score is:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nt = (780 - 800) / (30 / √50)\nt = -20 / (30 / √50)\nt = -20 / (30 / 7.071)\nt = -20 / 4.243\nt ≈ -4.71\n\nNow, we need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 and 49 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 50 - 1 = 49). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical t-value to be approximately -1.68.\n\nSince our calculated t-score (-4.71) is less than the critical t-value (-1.68), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. \n\nThere is enough evidence at a 5% significance level to support the claim that the average lifespan of the light bulbs is less than 800 hours."
