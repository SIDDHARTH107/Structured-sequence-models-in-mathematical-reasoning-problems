    "message_1": "A restaurant has a menu with 6 types of appetizers, 8 types of main courses, and 4 types of desserts. How many different three-course meals (appetizer, main course, dessert) can be made using this menu?",
    "message_2": "To find the total number of different three-course meals, we can use the counting principle. We multiply the number of choices for each course together:\n\n6 appetizers × 8 main courses × 4 desserts = 48 × 4 = 192\n\nSo, there are 192 different three-course meals that can be made using this menu."
