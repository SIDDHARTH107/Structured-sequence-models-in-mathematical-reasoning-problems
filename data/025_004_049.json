    "message_1": "Let C be a smooth projective curve of genus 3 in P^3 over the complex numbers. Suppose there is a morphism from C to P^1 of degree 3. What is the intersection number of two distinct fibers of this morphism?",
    "message_2": "Let f: C → P^1 be the given morphism of degree 3. Let F_1 and F_2 be two distinct fibers of this morphism, i.e., F_1 = f^(-1)(p_1) and F_2 = f^(-1)(p_2) for distinct points p_1, p_2 in P^1. We want to compute the intersection number F_1 · F_2.\n\nSince f is a morphism of degree 3, each fiber F_i consists of 3 points (counted with multiplicity) by the degree-genus formula. Now, since F_1 and F_2 are distinct fibers, they are disjoint, i.e., they do not intersect each other. Therefore, the intersection number F_1 · F_2 is 0."
