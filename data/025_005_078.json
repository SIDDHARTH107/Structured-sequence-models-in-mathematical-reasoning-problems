    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety V, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the given equation with respect to x, y, and z, and then find the points where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet f(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz. Then, we have:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n∂f/∂z = 3z^2 - 3xy\n\nNow, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n3z^2 - 3xy = 0\n\nDivide each equation by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\nz^2 - xy = 0\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases for the singular points:\n\n1. If x = 0, then from the third equation, we have z = 0. Substituting these values into the first equation, we get y = 0. So, one singular point is (0, 0, 0).\n\n2. If x ≠ 0, we can divide the second equation by x and the third equation by z:\n\ny^2/x - z = 0\nz^2/y - x = 0\n\nNow, multiply the first equation by y and the second equation by x:\n\ny^3 - xz = 0\nxz^2 - xy = 0\n\nNotice that the first equation is the same as the original equation with z replaced by z^2. So, we have:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + z^6 = 3xyz^2\n\nNow, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + (3xy - y^3)^3 = 3xyz^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nx^3 + y^3 + 27x^3y^3 - 54x^2y^4 + 27xy^6 = 3xyz^2\n\nNow, let's consider the cases for z:\n\na) If z = 0, then from the first equation, we have x^2 = yz. Since x ≠ 0, we must have y = 0. But this contradicts our assumption that x ≠ 0. So, there are no singular points with z = 0 and x ≠ 0.\n\nb) If z ≠ 0, we can divide the equation by z^2:\n\nx^3/z^2 + y^3/z^2 + 27x^3y^3/z^2 - 54x^2y^4/z^2 + 27xy^6/z^2 = 3xy\n\nNow, let u = x/z and v = y/z. Then, we have:\n\nu^3 + v^3 + 27u^3v^3 - 54u^2v^4 + 27uv^6 = 3uv\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nu^3 + v^3 - 3uv + 27u^3v^3 - 54u^2v^4 + 27uv^6 = 0\n\nThis equation is symmetric in u and v, so we can substitute u = v:\n\n2u^3 - 3u^2 + 27u^6 - 54u^5 + 27u^6 = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n54u^6 - 108u^5 + 54u^3 = 0\n\nFactor out 54u^3:\n\n54u^3(u^3 - 2u^2 + 1) = 0\n\nSo, u^3 = x^3/z^3 = 0 or u^3 - 2u^2 + 1 = 0. The first case gives us x = 0, which we already considered. The second case has no real solutions for u, so there are no singular points with z ≠ 0 and x ≠ 0.\n\nThus, the only singular point of the algebraic variety V is (0, 0, 0)."
