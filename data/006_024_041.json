    "message_2": "To find the probability of not taking either a flight or a train, we can add the probabilities of taking a flight and taking a train, and then subtract the result from 1.\n\nProbability of taking a flight = 0.6\nProbability of taking a train = 0.3\n\nTotal probability of taking a flight or a train = 0.6 + 0.3 = 0.9\n\nNow, to find the probability of not taking either a flight or a train, we subtract the total probability from 1.\n\nProbability of not taking either a flight or a train = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1\n\nSo, the probability of not taking either a flight or a train on the trip is 0.1 or 10%."
