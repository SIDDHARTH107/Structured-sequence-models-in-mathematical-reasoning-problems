    "message_2": "To find the Hodge star operator of the 2-form ω, we first need to compute the Hodge dual of ω. The Hodge dual of a k-form α is defined as:\n\n*(α) = (1/k!(n-k)!) α^I1...Ik ε_I1...In dx^1 ∧ ... ∧ dx^n\n\nwhere n is the dimension of the manifold, k is the degree of the form, and ε is the Levi-Civita symbol. In our case, n = 3 and k = 2. The Levi-Civita symbol is defined as follows:\n\nε_I1...In = { +1 if (I1, ..., In) is an even permutation of (1, ..., n)\n               -1 if (I1, ..., In) is an odd permutation of (1, ..., n)\n                0 otherwise }\n\nNow, let's compute the Hodge dual of ω:\n\n*(ω) = (1/2!(3-2)!) ω^I1I2 ε_I1I2I3 dx^1 ∧ dx^2 ∧ dx^3\n\nω = xdy ∧ dz - ydx ∧ dz + zdx ∧ dy, so we have:\n\nω^12 = -x, ω^13 = y, ω^23 = z\n\nNow, we can compute the Hodge dual:\n\n*(ω) = ε_123 dx^1 ∧ dx^2 ∧ dx^3 - ε_132 dx^1 ∧ dx^2 ∧ dx^3 + ε_213 dx^1 ∧ dx^2 ∧ dx^3\n\nUsing the Levi-Civita symbol, we get:\n\n*(ω) = dx^1 ∧ dx^2 ∧ dx^3 - 0 + 0\n\nSo, the Hodge star operator of the 2-form ω is:\n\n*(ω) = dx^1 ∧ dx^2 ∧ dx^3"
