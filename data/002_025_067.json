    "message_1": "A triangle has two equal sides that measure 5 cm each. Find the length of the third side if the triangle is an isosceles triangle.",
    "message_2": "In an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal in length, and the angles opposite those sides are also equal. Let's denote the equal sides as a and b (a = b = 5 cm), and the third side as c. We don't have enough information to determine the exact length of the third side, c, as it can vary depending on the angles of the triangle. However, we can determine the possible range for the length of the third side.\n\nAccording to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. So, we have:\n\na + b > c\n5 + 5 > c\n10 > c\n\nAnd:\n\na + c > b\n5 + c > 5\nc > 0\n\nSo, the length of the third side, c, must be in the range of 0 < c < 10 cm."
