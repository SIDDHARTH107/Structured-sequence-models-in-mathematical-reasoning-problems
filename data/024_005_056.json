    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of S with respect to x, y, and z:\n\nS_x = 2x\nS_y = 2y\nS_z = -2\n\nNow, let's find the unit normal vector N at point P(1, -1, 2):\n\nN = (S_x, S_y, -1) / ||(S_x, S_y, -1)||\nN = (2, -2, -1) / ||(2, -2, -1)||\nN = (2, -2, -1) / sqrt(2^2 + (-2)^2 + (-1)^2)\nN = (2, -2, -1) / sqrt(9)\nN = (2/3, -2/3, -1/3)\n\nNow we will find the second partial derivatives of S:\n\nS_xx = 2\nS_yy = 2\nS_xy = 0\nS_yx = 0\nS_xz = 0\nS_yz = 0\nS_zx = 0\nS_zy = 0\nS_zz = 0\n\nNow we will find the second fundamental form matrix:\n\n[ L  M ] = [ S_xx  S_xy ] = [  2   0 ]\n[ M  N ]   [ S_yx  S_yy ]   [  0   2 ]\n\nNow we will find the principal curvatures (k1 and k2) by finding the eigenvalues of the second fundamental form matrix:\n\nThe characteristic equation is given by:\n\ndet(A - λI) = (L - λ)(N - λ) - M^2 = λ^2 - (L + N)λ + (LN - M^2)\n\nFor our matrix:\n\nλ^2 - 4λ + 4 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nλ = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nλ = (4 ± sqrt(4^2 - 4 * 1 * 4)) / 2 * 1\nλ = (4 ± sqrt(16 - 16)) / 2\nλ = (4 ± 0) / 2\n\nBoth eigenvalues are equal to 2, so the principal curvatures are:\n\nk1 = 2\nk2 = 2"
