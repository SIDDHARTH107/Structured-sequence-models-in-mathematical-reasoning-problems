    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products, A and B. The production of product A requires 4 hours of machine time and 6 hours of labor time, while the production of product B requires 3 hours of machine time and 5 hours of labor time. The factory has 300 hours of machine time and 450 hours of labor time available. Both products have a profit of $10 per unit. However, there is a constraint that at least 70% of the total production needs to be product B. How many units of each product should the factory produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 10x + 10y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. Machine time: 4x + 3y ≤ 300\n2. Labor time: 6x + 5y ≤ 450\n3. At least 70% of total production needs to be product B: y ≥ 0.7(x + y)\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint 3 for x:\n\ny ≥ 0.7x + 0.7y\n0.3y ≥ 0.7x\nx ≤ (0.3/0.7)y = (3/7)y\n\nNow we have the following inequalities:\n\n1. 4x + 3y ≤ 300\n2. 6x + 5y ≤ 450\n3. x ≤ (3/7)y\n\nWe will now find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities:\n\n1. x = (300 - 3y)/4\n2. x = (450 - 5y)/6\n3. x = (3/7)y\n\nThe intersection points of these lines are:\n\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (0, 100)\nC: (45, 60)\nD: (75, 0)\n\nWe will now check which of these points satisfy all the constraints:\n\nA: (0, 0) - Satisfies all constraints\nB: (0, 100) - Satisfies all constraints\nC: (45, 60) - Satisfies all constraints\nD: (75, 0) - Does not satisfy constraint 3\n\nNow we will evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at the feasible points A, B, and C:\n\nP(A) = 10(0) + 10(0) = $0\nP(B) = 10(0) + 10(100) = $1000\nP(C) = 10(45) + 10(60) = $1050\n\nThe maximum profit is $1050, which occurs when the factory produces 45 units of product A and 60 units of product B."
