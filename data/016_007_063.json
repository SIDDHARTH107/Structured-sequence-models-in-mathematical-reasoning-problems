    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal that is created by recursively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the larger cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube of each face and the central cube of the entire larger cube are removed. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nFor a Level-4 Menger sponge, this process is repeated 4 times. The number of cubes in each level can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of cubes = 20^n\n\nwhere n is the level of the Menger sponge.\n\nFor a Level-4 Menger sponge:\n\nNumber of cubes = 20^4 = 160,000\n\nSo, there are 160,000 cubes in the construction of a Level-4 Menger sponge."
