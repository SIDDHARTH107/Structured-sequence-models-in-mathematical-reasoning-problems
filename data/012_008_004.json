    "message_2": "To determine if a graph G is planar or not, we can use Euler's formula for connected planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nWe are given that the graph G has 10 vertices (V = 10) and 15 edges (E = 15). We can use the inequality derived from Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nE ≤ 3V - 6\n\nPlugging in the values for V and E:\n\n15 ≤ 3 * 10 - 6\n15 ≤ 30 - 6\n15 ≤ 24\n\nThe inequality holds true, so the graph G could be planar. However, we need to check one more condition to be sure. A graph is non-planar if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 (complete graph with 5 vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices in each partition).\n\nIn our case, the maximum number of edges in a complete graph with 10 vertices is:\n\nE_max = (10 * 9) / 2 = 45\n\nSince 15 is less than 45, it is not possible for the graph G to contain a subdivision of K5. Similarly, the maximum number of edges in a complete bipartite graph with 6 vertices (3 in each partition) is:\n\nE_max = 3 * 3 = 9\n\nSince 15 is greater than 9, it is possible for the graph G to contain a subdivision of K3,3. However, we do not have enough information to determine if G actually contains such a subgraph. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether the graph G is planar or not based on the given information."
