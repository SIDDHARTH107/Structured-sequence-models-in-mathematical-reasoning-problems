    "message_2": "In the One-time pad encryption technique, the key length should be equal to the message length for perfect secrecy. Since the key length is 10 and the message length is 15, we need to extend the key length to match the message length.\n\nLet's first find the number of possible permutations for a 15-character key. Each character can be one of 2^8 = 256 possible values (assuming 8-bit encoding). Therefore, the number of possible permutations for a 15-character key is:\n\n256^15 = 1.34078079 × 10^36\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible permutations for a 15-character message. Each character can be one of 256 possible values, so the number of possible permutations for a 15-character message is:\n\n256^15 = 1.34078079 × 10^36\n\nTo find the total number of possible permutations of the key and message, we multiply the number of permutations for the key by the number of permutations for the message:\n\n(1.34078079 × 10^36) * (1.34078079 × 10^36) = 1.79769313 × 10^72\n\nSo, there are approximately 1.79769313 × 10^72 possible permutations of the key and message."
