    "message_1": "A pharmaceutical company is developing a new drug for a rare disease. Based on previous clinical trials, they know that the disease affects 1 person in 1000 in the general population. The company conducted a study with 100 people who have the disease and 90 of them responded positively to the new drug. Using Bayesian statistics, calculate the probability that a patient selected at random will respond positively to the new drug.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the probability that a patient selected at random will respond positively to the new drug using Bayesian statistics, we need to define the following probabilities:\n\n1. P(D): The probability of having the disease, which is 1/1000.\n2. P(¬D): The probability of not having the disease, which is 1 - P(D) = 999/1000.\n3. P(R|D): The probability of responding positively to the drug given that the patient has the disease, which is 90/100 based on the study.\n4. P(R|¬D): The probability of responding positively to the drug given that the patient does not have the disease. This information is not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact probability. However, we can calculate the probability of responding positively to the drug given that the patient has the disease, which is P(R|D).\n\nSince we don't have enough information to calculate the exact probability using Bayesian statistics, we can only provide the probability of responding positively to the drug given that the patient has the disease:\n\nP(R|D) = 90/100 = 0.9 or 90%"
