    "message_1": "A hospital conducted a study on a certain medical condition and found that it occurs in 3 out of every 100 people. If 500 people visit the hospital, what is the probability that exactly 10 people will have this medical condition?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, having the medical condition) in n trials (number of people visiting the hospital)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time\n- p is the probability of success (having the medical condition) in a single trial\n- n is the number of trials (number of people visiting the hospital)\n- k is the number of successes (people having the medical condition)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 500 (number of people visiting the hospital)\n- k = 10 (number of people with the medical condition)\n- p = 3/100 = 0.03 (probability of having the medical condition)\n\nFirst, let's calculate nCk (500 choose 10):\n\nnCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\nnCk = 500! / (10!(500-10)!)\nnCk = 500! / (10! * 490!)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the factorial values, we get:\n\nnCk ≈ 10,272,278,170\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 10) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\nP(X = 10) = (10,272,278,170) * (0.03^10) * (0.97^490)\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 10) ≈ 0.102\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 10 people out of 500 visiting the hospital will have this medical condition is approximately 10.2%."
