    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to mechanism design:\n\nSuppose there are five players who are bidding for an item in an auction. The players have private valuations for the item, meaning they all have a different maximum amount they're willing to pay. Player 1 values the item at $20, player 2 values it at $30, player 3 values it at $35, player 4 values it at $40, and player 5 values it at $50. The auction will use a first-price sealed-bid mechanism, where the highest bidder wins the item and pays their bid. What must each player bid in order to maximize their expected utility (i.e. the difference between their valuation and their bid)?",
    "message_2": "In a first-price sealed-bid auction, each player's strategy is to bid slightly less than their true valuation to maximize their expected utility. This is because if they bid their true valuation, they would have zero utility if they win, as they would be paying exactly what they value the item for.\n\nTo determine the optimal bid for each player, we can use the concept of bid shading. Bid shading is the practice of bidding less than the true valuation to account for the competition and maximize expected utility. The optimal bid shading depends on the number of bidders and their valuations.\n\nIn this case, there are five players with valuations of $20, $30, $35, $40, and $50. To maximize their expected utility, each player should consider the valuations of the other players and bid slightly less than their own valuation.\n\nHere's a suggested bidding strategy for each player:\n\n1. Player 1 (valuation $20): Since player 1 has the lowest valuation, they have the least chance of winning the auction. They should still bid slightly less than their valuation, say around $18, to maximize their utility in case the other players bid lower than expected.\n\n2. Player 2 (valuation $30): Player 2 should consider that player 1 is likely to bid around $18 and the other players have higher valuations. They should bid slightly less than their valuation, say around $27, to maximize their utility.\n\n3. Player 3 (valuation $35): Player 3 should consider the bids of players 1 and 2 and the higher valuations of players 4 and 5. They should bid slightly less than their valuation, say around $32, to maximize their utility.\n\n4. Player 4 (valuation $40): Player 4 should consider the bids of players 1, 2, and 3 and the higher valuation of player 5. They should bid slightly less than their valuation, say around $37, to maximize their utility.\n\n5. Player 5 (valuation $50): Player 5 has the highest valuation and the best chance of winning the auction. They should bid slightly less than their valuation, say around $47, to maximize their utility.\n\nThese suggested bids are not unique solutions, as the optimal bidding strategy depends on the players' beliefs about the bidding behavior of the other players. However, the general principle of bidding slightly less than the true valuation holds for all players in a first-price sealed-bid auction."
