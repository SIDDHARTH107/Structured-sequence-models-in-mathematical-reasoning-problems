    "message_2": "To find the cardinality of the equivalence class of 2, we need to find the number of elements in S that are related to 2 by the relation R. According to the definition of R, a R b if and only if a + b is even.\n\nLet's check which elements in S satisfy this condition when b = 2:\n\n0 R 2: 0 + 2 = 2 (even)\n1 R 2: 1 + 2 = 3 (odd)\n2 R 2: 2 + 2 = 4 (even)\n3 R 2: 3 + 2 = 5 (odd)\n4 R 2: 4 + 2 = 6 (even)\n5 R 2: 5 + 2 = 7 (odd)\n6 R 2: 6 + 2 = 8 (even)\n7 R 2: 7 + 2 = 9 (odd)\n\nThe elements that are related to 2 by R are 0, 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, the cardinality of the equivalence class of 2 is 4."
