    "message_1": "Suppose a basketball team has a 60% chance of making a free throw and a 40% chance of missing it. If the team made the first free throw, what is the probability that they will make their next three free throws consecutively?",
    "message_2": "The probability of making each free throw is independent of the previous ones. So, to find the probability of making the next three free throws consecutively, we simply multiply the probabilities of making each free throw.\n\nProbability of making the next three free throws consecutively = (Probability of making 2nd free throw) × (Probability of making 3rd free throw) × (Probability of making 4th free throw)\n\nSince the probability of making a free throw is 60% (0.6), the calculation is:\n\n0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 = 0.216\n\nSo, the probability of making the next three free throws consecutively is 21.6%."
