    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $\\sqrt{18}$, we need to find the prime factorization of 18 and look for any pairs of the same factors.\n\nThe prime factorization of 18 is $2 \\times 3^2$. We have a pair of 3's, so we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\n$\\sqrt{18} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 3^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 3$\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is $3\\sqrt{2}$."
