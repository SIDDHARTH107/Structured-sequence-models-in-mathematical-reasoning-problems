    "message_2": "To find the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula:\n\nu · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ)\n\nwhere u · v is the dot product of the vectors, ||u|| and ||v|| are the magnitudes of the vectors, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of the vectors u and v:\n\nu · v = (4 * -2) + (-3 * 6) = -8 - 18 = -26\n\nNext, let's find the magnitudes of the vectors u and v:\n\n||u|| = √(4^2 + (-3)^2) = √(16 + 9) = √25 = 5\n||v|| = √((-2)^2 + 6^2) = √(4 + 36) = √40 = 2√10\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the dot product formula:\n\n-26 = (5)(2√10) cos(θ)\n\nDivide both sides by (5)(2√10):\n\ncos(θ) = -26 / (10√10) = -13 / (5√10)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the result:\n\nθ = arccos(-13 / (5√10))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nθ ≈ 131.81°\n\nRounded to the nearest degree, the angle between the two vectors u and v is approximately 132°."
