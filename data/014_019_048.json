    "message_1": "Let's say we have a transposition cipher with 10 columns and its ciphertext is \"TRGANISPE\" but we do not know the key used for encryption. Can you calculate the number of possible keys that could have been used?",
    "message_2": "A transposition cipher with 10 columns means that there are 10! (10 factorial) possible permutations of the columns, which represent the possible keys. To calculate 10!, we multiply all the numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n\nSo, there are 3,628,800 possible keys that could have been used for the encryption."
