    "message_1": "There are 7 books on a shelf. If you want to divide them into 2 piles such that one pile contains 4 books and the other pile contains 3 books, how many ways can this be done?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nIn this case, we have 7 books (n = 7) and we want to choose 4 books for one pile (k = 4). The other pile will automatically have the remaining 3 books.\n\nSo, we can calculate the number of ways to divide the books as follows:\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4!(7-4)!)\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4!3!)\nC(7, 4) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(3*2*1))\nC(7, 4) = (7*6*5) / (3*2*1)\nC(7, 4) = 210 / 6\nC(7, 4) = 35\n\nThere are 35 ways to divide the 7 books into 2 piles, with one pile containing 4 books and the other containing 3 books."
