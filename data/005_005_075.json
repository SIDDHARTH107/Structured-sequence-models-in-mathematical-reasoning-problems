    "message_1": "A candy company claims that their bags of candy contain an average of 40 peanut butter candy pieces per bag with a standard deviation of 5. If a randomly selected bag is sampled, what is the probability that it contains between 35 and 45 peanut butter candy pieces?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we will find the z-scores for 35 and 45:\n\nz1 = (35 - 40) / 5 = -1\nz2 = (45 - 40) / 5 = 1\n\nNow, we will look up the probabilities for these z-scores in the standard normal distribution table. The table gives us the area to the left of the z-score.\n\nP(z1) = P(-1) ≈ 0.1587\nP(z2) = P(1) ≈ 0.8413\n\nTo find the probability that a bag contains between 35 and 45 peanut butter candy pieces, we will subtract the probabilities:\n\nP(35 < X < 45) = P(z2) - P(z1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 ≈ 0.6826\n\nSo, there is approximately a 68.26% chance that a randomly selected bag contains between 35 and 45 peanut butter candy pieces."
