    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27, and let g be any non-identity element of G with order 3. Since |G| = 27 = 3^3, by the Sylow theorems, G has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, say P. Since the order of g is 3, g must be an element of P. Note that |P| = 3^2 = 9.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. Since |G| = 27 and |P| = 9, we have |G/P| = 3. Let hP be a non-identity element of G/P, where h is an element of G. Then, the order of hP in G/P is 3 (since G/P is a group of prime order). This implies that (hP)^3 = h^3P = P, so h^3 ∈ P.\n\nSince h is not an element of P (otherwise, hP would be the identity element of G/P), we have that h^3 ≠ e (the identity element of G). Thus, h^3 must be some non-identity element of P. Since g is also a non-identity element of P with order 3, we can write h^3 = g^k for some integer k with 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 (since g has order 3).\n\nNow, let's consider the element hg. We have (hg)^3 = h^3g^3 = (g^k)g^3 = g^(k+3). Since k+3 is not divisible by 3, the order of hg is also 3. Note that hg is not an element of P, as it cannot be written as a product of elements from P alone.\n\nLet H = ⟨h, hg⟩ be the subgroup generated by h and hg. Since h and hg have order 3, we have |H| = 9. Moreover, H ∩ P = {e}, as the only element of order 3 in P is g, and neither h nor hg is equal to g. Thus, we have G = P ∪ H, and |G| = |P| + |H| - |P ∩ H| = 9 + 9 - 1 = 27.\n\nNow, we can define a function φ: G → H × P by φ(x) = (h^i, g^j) if x = h^i * g^j for some integers i and j. It is easy to verify that φ is a group isomorphism, as it preserves the group operation and has an inverse function.\n\nSince H and P are both non-abelian groups of order 9, G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group of order 27."
