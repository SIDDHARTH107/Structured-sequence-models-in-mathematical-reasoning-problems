    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function y = sin(x) + 3cos(x), we will differentiate each term with respect to x.\n\nThe derivative of sin(x) with respect to x is cos(x), and the derivative of 3cos(x) with respect to x is -3sin(x). So the derivative of y with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = cos(x) - 3sin(x)\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at x = π/2:\n\ndy/dx = cos(π/2) - 3sin(π/2)\n\ncos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1, so:\n\ndy/dx = 0 - 3(1) = -3\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the function y = sin(x) + 3cos(x) when x = π/2 is -3."
