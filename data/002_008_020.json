    "message_1": "A cone has a height of 12 cm and a base radius of 4 cm. Find its volume in cubic centimeters.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a cone, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3)πr²h\n\nwhere r is the radius of the base, h is the height, and π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n\nIn this case, the height (h) is 12 cm and the base radius (r) is 4 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(4 cm)²(12 cm)\n\nVolume = (1/3)π(16 cm²)(12 cm)\n\nVolume = (1/3)(3.14159)(192 cm³)\n\nVolume ≈ 201.06 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of the cone is approximately 201.06 cubic centimeters."
