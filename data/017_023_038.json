    "message_1": "How many non-abelian groups of order 72 are there, and can you name each one of them?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of non-abelian groups of order 72, we first need to find the prime factorization of 72. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nNow, we will use the formula for the number of groups of a given order, which is the product of the p-group counts for each prime factor. The p-group counts are given by the partitions of the exponents in the prime factorization.\n\nFor 2^3, there are three partitions: (3), (2, 1), and (1, 1, 1). These correspond to the following cyclic groups: C_8, C_4 × C_2, and C_2 × C_2 × C_2.\n\nFor 3^2, there are two partitions: (2) and (1, 1). These correspond to the cyclic groups: C_9 and C_3 × C_3.\n\nNow, we will find the direct products of these groups:\n\n1. C_8 × C_9\n2. C_4 × C_2 × C_9\n3. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_9\n4. C_8 × C_3 × C_3\n5. C_4 × C_2 × C_3 × C_3\n6. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_3 × C_3\n\nOut of these six possibilities, the first one, C_8 × C_9, is abelian, so we can exclude it. The remaining five possibilities are non-abelian groups of order 72:\n\n1. C_4 × C_2 × C_9\n2. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_9\n3. C_8 × C_3 × C_3\n4. C_4 × C_2 × C_3 × C_3\n5. C_2 × C_2 × C_2 × C_3 × C_3\n\nSo, there are 5 non-abelian groups of order 72."
