    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve from the subtopic of radioactive decay and half-life equations:\n\nSuppose there are initially 250 grams of a radioactive substance. The substance has a half-life of 5 days. How much of the substance will be left after 20 days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the radioactive decay formula:\n\nFinal Amount = Initial Amount * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial amount is 250 grams, the half-life is 5 days, and the time elapsed is 20 days. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal Amount = 250 * (1/2)^(20 / 5)\n\nFinal Amount = 250 * (1/2)^4\n\nFinal Amount = 250 * (1/16)\n\nFinal Amount = 15.625 grams\n\nSo, after 20 days, there will be approximately 15.625 grams of the radioactive substance left."
