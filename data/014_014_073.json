    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext \"HELLO\" using the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"MATH\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create the 5x5 Playfair matrix using the keyword \"MATH\":\n   M A T H B\n   C D E F G\n   I K L N O\n   P Q R S U\n   V W X Y Z\n\n2. Split the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them:\n   HE LL OX\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair cipher rules:\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrap around if needed).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrap around if needed).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in the same row but in the other corner of the rectangle.\n\n   HE -> ZC\n   LL -> KI\n   OX -> NY\n\n4. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the ciphertext:\n   ZCKINY\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext is \"ZCKINY\"."
