    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into its row-echelon form. The augmented matrix for the given system is:\n\n| 3  2  1 | 7 |\n| 1 -1  2 | 2 |\n| 2  3  4 | 13|\n\nStep 1: Swap Row 1 and Row 2 to have a 1 in the top left corner.\n\n| 1 -1  2 | 2 |\n| 3  2  1 | 7 |\n| 2  3  4 | 13|\n\nStep 2: Replace Row 2 with (-3 * Row 1) + Row 2 and Row 3 with (-2 * Row 1) + Row 3 to eliminate the x terms in Row 2 and Row 3.\n\n| 1 -1  2 | 2  |\n| 0  5 -5 | 1  |\n| 0  5  0 | 9  |\n\nStep 3: Divide Row 2 by 5 to get a leading 1 in the second row.\n\n| 1 -1  2 | 2  |\n| 0  1 -1 | 0.2|\n| 0  5  0 | 9  |\n\nStep 4: Replace Row 1 with (Row 2 + Row 1) and Row 3 with (-5 * Row 2) + Row 3 to eliminate the y terms in Row 1 and Row 3.\n\n| 1  0  1 | 2.2|\n| 0  1 -1 | 0.2|\n| 0  0  5 | 8  |\n\nStep 5: Divide Row 3 by 5 to get a leading 1 in the third row.\n\n| 1  0  1 | 2.2|\n| 0  1 -1 | 0.2|\n| 0  0  1 | 1.6|\n\nStep 6: Replace Row 1 with (-1 * Row 3) + Row 1 and Row 2 with (Row 3 + Row 2) to eliminate the z terms in Row 1 and Row 2.\n\n| 1  0  0 | 0.6|\n| 0  1  0 | 1.8|\n| 0  0  1 | 1.6|\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 0.6, y = 1.8, and z = 1.6."
