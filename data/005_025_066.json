    "message_1": "A group of 50 students took a math test, and their scores were normally distributed with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 10. What proportion of students scored above 90?",
    "message_2": "To find the proportion of students who scored above 90, we can use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFor a score of 90:\n\nz = (90 - 80) / 10\nz = 10 / 10\nz = 1\n\nNow, we need to find the proportion of students who scored above this z-score of 1. We can use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the area to the left of the z-score, which represents the proportion of students who scored below 90.\n\nLooking up the z-score of 1 in the z-table, we find that the area to the left is approximately 0.8413. This means that about 84.13% of students scored below 90.\n\nSince we want to find the proportion of students who scored above 90, we can subtract the area to the left from 1:\n\n1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n\nSo, approximately 15.87% of students scored above 90."
