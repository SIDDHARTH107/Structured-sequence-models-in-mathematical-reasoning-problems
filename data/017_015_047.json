    "message_2": "To find the distinct non-abelian groups of order 24, we can use the Sylow theorems. The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. \n\nLet G be a group of order 24. By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) divides 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) divides 8 and is congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nWe will consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Both P and Q are normal in G since they are unique. P has order 8 and Q has order 3. Since P and Q have relatively prime orders, their intersection is trivial, and G is isomorphic to the direct product P x Q. However, this case gives us an abelian group, which we are not interested in.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal in G. There are three Sylow 2-subgroups, and they are not normal in G. Let P be one of these Sylow 2-subgroups. Since the order of P is 8, P is isomorphic to either C8, C4 x C2, or D4 (cyclic group, direct product of two cyclic groups, or dihedral group, respectively). We can rule out P being isomorphic to C8 since that would make G abelian. \n\nIf P is isomorphic to C4 x C2, then G is a semidirect product of Q and P. There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from Q to Aut(P), which has order 2. This gives us a non-abelian group G1, which is isomorphic to the group C4 x (C2 x C3), also known as the extension of C4 by the direct product of C2 and C3.\n\nIf P is isomorphic to D4, then G is a semidirect product of Q and P. There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from Q to Aut(P), which has order 2. This gives us a non-abelian group G2, which is isomorphic to the group D4 x C3, also known as the extension of D4 by C3.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nThis case gives us an abelian group, which we are not interested in.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. Let P be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups and Q be one of the Sylow 3-subgroups. If P is isomorphic to C4 x C2 and Q is isomorphic to C3, then G is a semidirect product of Q and P. There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from Q to Aut(P), which give us two non-abelian groups G3 and G4. Both of these groups are isomorphic to the group (C2 x C2) : C3, also known as the extension of C2 x C2 by C3.\n\nIn summary, there are three distinct non-abelian groups of order 24: G1, G2, G3, and G4. Their names and isomorphisms are as follows:\n\n1. G1: C4 x (C2 x C3) (extension of C4 by the direct product of C2 and C3)\n2. G2: D4 x C3 (extension of D4 by C3)\n3. G3: (C2 x C2) : C3 (extension of C2 x C2 by C3)\n4. G4: (C2 x C2) : C3 (extension of C2 x C2 by C3)\n\nNote that none of these groups are isomorphic to the cyclic group C24 or the alternating group A5. They are all distinct non-abelian groups of order 24."
