    "message_2": "Since G is a cyclic group with generator a and order 24, we can write the elements of G as {a^0, a^1, a^2, ..., a^23}. Now, we are given that H is a subgroup of G with order 6. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. Since 6 divides 24, H is a valid subgroup.\n\nTo find the generator of H, we need to find an element b in H such that b has order 6. Recall that the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that b^n = e (the identity element).\n\nWe know that a^24 = e (since |G| = 24). We want to find an element b = a^k such that b^6 = e. In other words, we want to find the smallest positive integer k such that (a^k)^6 = a^(6k) = e.\n\nSince a^24 = e, we know that 24 must divide 6k. The smallest multiple of 6 that is also a divisor of 24 is 12. So, we can set 6k = 12, which gives k = 2.\n\nThus, the generator of H is b = a^2."
