    "message_1": "Consider the signal given by $f(t) = 2\\sin(2\\pi t) + 3\\cos(6\\pi t)$ in the time domain. \nWhat is the frequency content of $f(t)$ in the frequency domain by using the Fourier transform?",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency content of the given signal $f(t) = 2\\sin(2\\pi t) + 3\\cos(6\\pi t)$, we can use the Fourier transform. However, since the signal is composed of sinusoids, we can directly analyze the frequency components without computing the Fourier transform.\n\nThe given signal has two components:\n\n1. $2\\sin(2\\pi t)$: This is a sine wave with a frequency of $2\\pi$ radians per second, which corresponds to a frequency of $1$ Hz.\n\n2. $3\\cos(6\\pi t)$: This is a cosine wave with a frequency of $6\\pi$ radians per second, which corresponds to a frequency of $3$ Hz.\n\nTherefore, the frequency content of the signal $f(t)$ in the frequency domain consists of two distinct frequencies: $1$ Hz and $3$ Hz."
