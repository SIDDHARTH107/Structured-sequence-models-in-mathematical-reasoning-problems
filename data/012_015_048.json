    "message_2": "To determine if the graph is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, we have 10 vertices, so a connected graph would need at least 9 edges.\n\nSince our graph has 13 edges, it is possible that the graph is connected. However, we cannot conclude that it is connected just based on the number of edges. We would need more information about the specific connections between vertices to determine if the graph is connected or disconnected.\n\nIf the graph is disconnected, we can calculate the number of connected components using the formula:\n\nNumber of connected components = (Total number of vertices) - (Total number of edges) + k\n\nwhere k is the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine if the graph is connected or disconnected, we cannot calculate the exact number of connected components."
