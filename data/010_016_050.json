    "message_2": "Let's first understand the concept of genus and loops on a surface. A closed surface with genus 2 is a surface with two \"holes\" in it, like a double torus (two donuts connected). A loop on a surface is a closed curve that does not intersect itself.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum number of intersection points for the given k loops on the surface X with genus 2.\n\nFor k = 1, there is only one loop, and it does not need to intersect itself or any other loop. So, the minimum number of intersection points is 0.\n\nFor k = 2, we can draw two loops on the surface such that they do not intersect each other. One loop can go around one hole, and the other loop can go around the other hole. So, the minimum number of intersection points is 0.\n\nFor k = 3, we can draw three loops on the surface such that they intersect at a minimum of 1 point. One loop can go around one hole, the second loop can go around the other hole, and the third loop can go around both holes, intersecting the first two loops at a single point. So, the minimum number of intersection points is 1.\n\nFor k ≥ 4, we can draw k loops on the surface such that they intersect at a minimum of k - 3 points. We can draw the first three loops as described above, and then for each additional loop (k - 3 loops), we can draw it around both holes, intersecting the first two loops at a single point. Each of these additional loops will intersect at a different point, so the minimum number of intersection points is k - 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum number of intersection points for k loops on a closed surface with genus 2 is:\n\n- 0 for k = 1 or k = 2\n- 1 for k = 3\n- k - 3 for k ≥ 4"
