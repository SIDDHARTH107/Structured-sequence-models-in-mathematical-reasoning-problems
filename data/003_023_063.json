    "message_2": "To find the cross product of vectors A and B using trigonometry, we first need to find the angle between the two vectors and the magnitudes of the vectors. \n\n1. Find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\nMagnitude of A = ||A|| = √(3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2) = √(9 + 16 + 25) = √50\nMagnitude of B = ||B|| = √(2^2 + 7^2 + 1^2) = √(4 + 49 + 1) = √54\n\n2. Find the dot product of vectors A and B:\n\nA · B = (3 * 2) + (4 * 7) + (5 * 1) = 6 + 28 + 5 = 39\n\n3. Find the cosine of the angle between vectors A and B:\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| * ||B||) = 39 / (√50 * √54) ≈ 0.5701\n\n4. Find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(0.5701) ≈ 55.1°\n\n5. Find the magnitude of the cross product:\n\n||A x B|| = ||A|| * ||B|| * sin(θ) ≈ √50 * √54 * sin(55.1°) ≈ 35.36\n\n6. Find the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B:\n\nLet's use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the unit vector. The direction will be given by the cross product of the unit vectors of A and B.\n\nUnit vector of A = A / ||A|| = <3/√50, 4/√50, 5/√50>\nUnit vector of B = B / ||B|| = <2/√54, 7/√54, 1/√54>\n\nNow, we can find the cross product of the unit vectors:\n\nUnit_A x Unit_B = <(4/√50 * 1/√54 - 5/√50 * 7/√54), (5/√50 * 2/√54 - 3/√50 * 1/√54), (3/√50 * 7/√54 - 4/√50 * 2/√54)>\n\nUnit_A x Unit_B ≈ <-0.2679, 0.2679, 0.8014>\n\n7. Find the cross product A x B:\n\nA x B = ||A x B|| * (Unit_A x Unit_B) ≈ 35.36 * <-0.2679, 0.2679, 0.8014>\n\nA x B ≈ <-9.47, 9.47, 28.34>\n\nSo, the cross product of vectors A and B is approximately <-9.47, 9.47, 28.34>."
