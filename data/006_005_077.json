    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces computer chips and the probability of a defective chip being produced is 0.05. If the company produces 1000 computer chips in a day, what is the probability that less than 50 defective chips will be produced in a day?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective chips\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- n is the total number of chips produced (1000 in this case)\n- k is the number of defective chips (we want to find the probability of having less than 50 defective chips)\n- p is the probability of a chip being defective (0.05)\n- (1-p) is the probability of a chip not being defective (0.95)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of having less than 50 defective chips, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 0 to 49:\n\nP(X < 50) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 0 to 49\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use the complement rule, which states that:\n\nP(X < 50) = 1 - P(X ≥ 50)\n\nNow, we only need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 50 to 1000:\n\nP(X < 50) = 1 - Σ P(X = k) for k = 50 to 1000\n\nTo calculate this sum, we can use a normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The normal approximation uses the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of the binomial distribution, which are given by:\n\nμ = n * p = 1000 * 0.05 = 50\nσ = √(n * p * (1-p)) = √(1000 * 0.05 * 0.95) ≈ 6.93\n\nNow, we can use the standard normal distribution (Z) to approximate the probability:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWe want to find P(X < 50), which is equivalent to P(Z < (50 - μ) / σ):\n\nP(Z < (50 - 50) / 6.93) = P(Z < 0)\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that:\n\nP(Z < 0) ≈ 0.5\n\nSo, the probability of having less than 50 defective chips in a day is approximately 0.5 or 50%."
