    "message_2": "To compute the parallel transport of the vector $\\vec{v}_0=(1,0,0)$ along the curve $C(t)=(\\sin(2t), \\cos(2t), t)$, we first need to find the tangent vector of the curve at each point. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the curve with respect to $t$:\n\n$$\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = (2\\cos(2t), -2\\sin(2t), 1)$$\n\nNow, we want to find the parallel transport of $\\vec{v}_0$ along the curve, which means we want to find a vector $\\vec{v}(t)$ that is parallel to the tangent vector at each point and has the same initial value as $\\vec{v}_0$. To do this, we can use the following equation:\n\n$$\\frac{d\\vec{v}(t)}{dt} = k(t) \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}$$\n\nwhere $k(t)$ is a scalar function that determines the proportionality between the derivative of $\\vec{v}(t)$ and the tangent vector. We can find $k(t)$ by taking the dot product of both sides with the tangent vector:\n\n$$\\frac{d\\vec{v}(t)}{dt} \\cdot \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = k(t) \\left|\\frac{dC(t)}{dt}\\right|^2$$\n\nSince $\\vec{v}(0) = \\vec{v}_0 = (1,0,0)$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{d\\vec{v}(0)}{dt} \\cdot \\frac{dC(0)}{dt} = k(0) \\left|\\frac{dC(0)}{dt}\\right|^2$$\n\n$$\\frac{d\\vec{v}(0)}{dt} \\cdot (2,0,1) = k(0) (4+1)$$\n\n$$2\\frac{dv_x(0)}{dt} + \\frac{dv_z(0)}{dt} = 5k(0)$$\n\nSince $\\vec{v}(0) = (1,0,0)$, we have $\\frac{dv_x(0)}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dv_z(0)}{dt} = 0$, so $k(0) = 0$.\n\nNow, we can integrate the equation for $\\frac{d\\vec{v}(t)}{dt}$:\n\n$$\\vec{v}(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\vec{v}(t)}{dt} dt = \\int k(t) \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} dt = \\int k(t) (2\\cos(2t), -2\\sin(2t), 1) dt$$\n\nSince $k(0) = 0$, we have:\n\n$$\\vec{v}(t) = (1, -2\\int_0^t k(s) \\sin(2s) ds, \\int_0^t k(s) ds)$$\n\nTo find $\\vec{v}(t)$, we need to find the function $k(t)$. However, without more information about the curve or the parallel transport, we cannot determine $k(t)$ and thus cannot find the exact expression for $\\vec{v}(t)$."
