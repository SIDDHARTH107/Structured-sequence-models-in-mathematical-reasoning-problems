    "message_2": "To solve the given equation, we can treat it as a quadratic equation in terms of sin(x):\n\n2sin^2(x) + 3sin(x) - 2 = 0\n\nLet y = sin(x), then the equation becomes:\n\n2y^2 + 3y - 2 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor this quadratic equation:\n\n(2y - 1)(y + 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for y:\n\n1) 2y - 1 = 0 => y = 1/2\n2) y + 2 = 0 => y = -2\n\nHowever, since the sine function has a range of -1 to 1, the second solution (y = -2) is not valid. So, we only need to consider the first solution:\n\nsin(x) = 1/2\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x that satisfy this equation in the given range of 0 to 2π:\n\nx = arcsin(1/2)\n\nThere are two values of x in the given range:\n\nx = π/6 (or 30°)\nx = 5π/6 (or 150°)\n\nSo, the solutions for x in the given range are x = π/6 and x = 5π/6."
