    "message_2": "To find the global minimum of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 + 2x^2 + 7x - 10 in the interval [-2, 2], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, we find the first derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 4x^3 + 2x^2 + 7x - 10) = 12x^3 - 12x^2 + 4x + 7\n\nNow, we find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero:\n\n12x^3 - 12x^2 + 4x + 7 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation, which is difficult to solve analytically. However, we can use numerical methods to find the approximate critical points. Using a numerical solver, we find that there is one real root:\n\nx ≈ 0.543\n\nNow, we evaluate the function at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-2) ≈ 54\nf(0.543) ≈ -10.796\nf(2) ≈ 14\n\nThe global minimum of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 + 2x^2 + 7x - 10 in the interval [-2, 2] is approximately -10.796, which occurs at x ≈ 0.543."
