    "message_1": "A furniture manufacturer produces chairs and tables. Each chair takes 3 hours of labor and 2 square meters of wood, while each table takes 5 hours of labor and 4 square meters of wood. The manufacturer has 240 hours of labor and 160 square meters of wood available for production each week. The profit on one chair is $40 and on one table is $70. How many chairs and tables should the manufacturer produce each week to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chairs and y be the number of tables produced each week.\n\nThe constraints for labor and wood are as follows:\n\nLabor: 3x + 5y ≤ 240\nWood: 2x + 4y ≤ 160\n\nThe objective function to maximize profit is:\n\nProfit = 40x + 70y\n\nFirst, we will solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\nFor labor: y ≤ (240 - 3x) / 5\nFor wood: y ≤ (160 - 2x) / 4\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing these inequalities:\n\n1. y ≤ (240 - 3x) / 5\n2. y ≤ (160 - 2x) / 4\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (0,40), (48, 30), and (80, 0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\n1. Profit at (0,0) = 40(0) + 70(0) = $0\n2. Profit at (0,40) = 40(0) + 70(40) = $2800\n3. Profit at (48,30) = 40(48) + 70(30) = $1920 + $2100 = $4020\n4. Profit at (80,0) = 40(80) + 70(0) = $3200\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the point (48, 30), where the manufacturer produces 48 chairs and 30 tables each week, resulting in a profit of $4020."
