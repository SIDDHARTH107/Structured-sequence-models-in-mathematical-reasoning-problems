    "message_2": "An elliptic curve over the field of real numbers can be written in the form $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$. In this case, we have $A = 2$ and $B = 2$. The points on the curve with finite order are the points that, when added to themselves a certain number of times, result in the point at infinity (the identity element for the elliptic curve).\n\nFirst, we need to find the point at infinity. In the projective plane, the point at infinity for an elliptic curve in the form $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ is $(0:1:0)$. This is the identity element for the elliptic curve group law.\n\nNow, we need to find the points on the curve that have finite order. To do this, we can use the group law for elliptic curves. Given two points $P = (x_1, y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2, y_2)$ on the curve, their sum $P + Q = (x_3, y_3)$ is given by:\n\n1. If $P = Q$, then $x_3 = \\frac{3x_1^2 + A}{2y_1}$ and $y_3 = \\frac{-x_1^3 + B + x_3(x_1 - x_3)}{y_1}$.\n2. If $P \\neq Q$, then $x_3 = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ and $y_3 = \\frac{-x_1^3 + B + x_3(x_1 - x_3)}{y_1}$.\n\nA point $P$ has finite order if there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $nP = \\infty$. In other words, we need to find the points $P$ on the curve such that $nP = (0:1:0)$ for some positive integer $n$.\n\nFor elliptic curves over the real numbers, the torsion subgroup (the set of points with finite order) is either trivial (consisting only of the point at infinity) or has at most two elements. In this case, we can check that the curve has no points of order 2 by setting $y = 0$ and solving for $x$:\n\n$0 = x^3 + 2x + 2 \\Rightarrow x^3 = -2x - 2$\n\nThis equation has no real solutions, so there are no points of order 2 on the curve.\n\nNext, we can check for points of order 3 by considering the curve in the projective plane and looking for points $(x:y:z)$ such that $3P = (0:1:0)$. However, for elliptic curves over the real numbers, the torsion subgroup can have at most two elements, so there cannot be any points of order 3.\n\nTherefore, the only point on the curve with finite order is the point at infinity $(0:1:0)$."
