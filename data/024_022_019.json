    "message_2": "An isometry of the Euclidean plane is a transformation that preserves the distance between any two points. There are four types of isometries in the Euclidean plane: translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections.\n\n1. Translation:\nA translation is a transformation that moves every point of the plane by the same vector. In this case, we want to move the origin (0, 0) to the point (3, 4). The translation vector is (3, 4), so the translation is given by the function:\n\nT(x, y) = (x + 3, y + 4)\n\n2. Rotation:\nA rotation is a transformation that rotates the plane around a fixed point by a certain angle. To move the origin to the point (3, 4), we need to rotate the plane around a point that is equidistant from both the origin and (3, 4). The distance between the origin and (3, 4) is 5 (by the Pythagorean theorem). Let's denote the center of rotation as (a, b). Then, we have:\n\n(a - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2 = (a - 3)^2 + (b - 4)^2 = 5^2\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get two possible centers of rotation: (1, 2) and (2, 2). For each center, there are two possible angles of rotation: 120° (2π/3 radians) and 240° (4π/3 radians). So, we have four possible rotations:\n\nR1(x, y) = Rotation by 120° around (1, 2)\nR2(x, y) = Rotation by 240° around (1, 2)\nR3(x, y) = Rotation by 120° around (2, 2)\nR4(x, y) = Rotation by 240° around (2, 2)\n\n3. Reflection:\nA reflection is a transformation that reflects the plane across a line. To move the origin to the point (3, 4), we need to reflect the plane across a line that is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the origin and (3, 4). The midpoint of this segment is (1.5, 2), and the slope of the line connecting the origin and (3, 4) is 4/3. The slope of the perpendicular bisector is -3/4. The equation of the reflection line is:\n\ny - 2 = -3/4 (x - 1.5)\n\nThe reflection isometry is given by the function:\n\nR(x, y) = Reflection across the line y - 2 = -3/4 (x - 1.5)\n\n4. Glide reflection:\nA glide reflection is a combination of a reflection and a translation along the reflection line. However, in this case, a glide reflection cannot move the origin to the point (3, 4), because the reflection line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the origin and (3, 4), and the translation would move the origin back to itself.\n\nIn conclusion, there are six isometries of the Euclidean metric on the plane that take the origin to the point (3, 4):\n\n1. Translation: T(x, y) = (x + 3, y + 4)\n2. Rotation: R1(x, y) = Rotation by 120° around (1, 2)\n3. Rotation: R2(x, y) = Rotation by 240° around (1, 2)\n4. Rotation: R3(x, y) = Rotation by 120° around (2, 2)\n5. Rotation: R4(x, y) = Rotation by 240° around (2, 2)\n6. Reflection: R(x, y) = Reflection across the line y - 2 = -3/4 (x - 1.5)"
