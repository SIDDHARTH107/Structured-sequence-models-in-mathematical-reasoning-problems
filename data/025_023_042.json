Let Y be a closed irreducible subvariety of X of codimension 2. Let Z be the intersection of Y with a general hyperplane section of X.\n\nSuppose that the intersection cohomology group with rational coefficients IH^3(Z,Q) is isomorphic to Q(−1)⊕Q(−1) and that IH^i(Z,Q) = 0 for i ≠ 3.\n\nCompute the Betti numbers b_i(Y,Q) for i = 1, 2, 3, and 4.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Betti numbers b_i(Y,Q) for i = 1, 2, 3, and 4, we will use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, which states that for a smooth projective variety X and a general hyperplane section Z, the restriction map H^i(X,Q) → H^i(Z,Q) is an isomorphism for i < dim(X) - 1 and injective for i = dim(X) - 1.\n\nSince Y is a closed irreducible subvariety of X of codimension 2, it is a smooth projective variety of dimension 2. Then Z is a general hyperplane section of Y, and it is also a smooth projective variety of dimension 1.\n\nNow, we can compute the Betti numbers of Y using the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem:\n\n1. b_1(Y,Q): Since dim(Y) = 2, the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem implies that H^1(Y,Q) → H^1(Z,Q) is an isomorphism. Since IH^1(Z,Q) = 0, we have H^1(Y,Q) = 0, and thus b_1(Y,Q) = 0.\n\n2. b_2(Y,Q): Similarly, the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem implies that H^2(Y,Q) → H^2(Z,Q) is an isomorphism. Since IH^2(Z,Q) = 0, we have H^2(Y,Q) = 0, and thus b_2(Y,Q) = 0.\n\n3. b_3(Y,Q): For i = dim(Y) - 1 = 1, the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem implies that the restriction map H^3(Y,Q) → H^3(Z,Q) is injective. Since IH^3(Z,Q) is isomorphic to Q(−1)⊕Q(−1), we have H^3(Y,Q) ⊆ Q(−1)⊕Q(−1). However, we cannot determine the exact structure of H^3(Y,Q) from the given information, so we cannot compute b_3(Y,Q).\n\n4. b_4(Y,Q): Since Y is a smooth projective variety of dimension 2, its cohomology groups vanish for i > 2, so H^4(Y,Q) = 0 and b_4(Y,Q) = 0.\n\nIn summary, we have b_1(Y,Q) = 0, b_2(Y,Q) = 0, b_4(Y,Q) = 0, but we cannot compute b_3(Y,Q) from the given information."
