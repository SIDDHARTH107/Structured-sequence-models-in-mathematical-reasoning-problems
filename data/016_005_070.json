    "message_2": "In the Cantor set construction, we start with a line segment of length 9 and remove the middle third in each iteration. After each iteration, the remaining line segments are 1/3 of their previous length. \n\nAfter the 1st iteration, the remaining line segments have a total length of (2/3) * 9 = 6.\nAfter the 2nd iteration, the remaining line segments have a total length of (2/3) * 6 = 4.\nAfter the 3rd iteration, the remaining line segments have a total length of (2/3) * 4 = 8/3.\nAfter the 4th iteration, the remaining line segments have a total length of (2/3) * 8/3 = 16/9.\nAfter the 5th iteration, the remaining line segments have a total length of (2/3) * 16/9 = 32/27.\n\nSo, after the 5th iteration, the remaining line segments have a total length of 32/27."
