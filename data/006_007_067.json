    "message_2": "To find the expected change in the stock price, we can use the formula for expected value:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of Increase * Increase Amount) + (Probability of Decrease * Decrease Amount)\n\nIn this case, the probability of increase is 30% (0.3) and the increase amount is $10. The probability of decrease is 70% (0.7) and the decrease amount is $5.\n\nExpected Value = (0.3 * 10) + (0.7 * -5)\n\nExpected Value = (3) + (-3.5)\n\nExpected Value = -0.5\n\nThe expected change in the stock price is a decrease of $0.5."
