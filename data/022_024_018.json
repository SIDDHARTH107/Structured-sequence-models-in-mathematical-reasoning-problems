    "message_1": "Consider the heat equation in the complex plane, given by \n\nu_t = u_xx + u_yy, \n\nwhere u(x,y,t) is the temperature at the point (x,y) at time t, and subscripts denote partial derivatives. Suppose that the initial temperature distribution is given by \n\nu(x,y,0) = cos(3x)sin(2y). \n\nFind the temperature distribution u(x,y,t) at time t = 0.5.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of three functions, one depending on x, one depending on y, and one depending on t:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstitute this into the heat equation:\n\nX(x)Y(y)T'(t) = X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t)\n\nNow, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y)T(t):\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = X''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y)\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\nX''(x) / X(x) + Y''(y) / Y(y) = -λ\n\nNow, we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\nX''(x) = -λX(x)\nY''(y) = (λ - μ)Y(y)\n\nwith μ = 0 (since there are no boundary conditions given in the problem). The general solutions for these equations are:\n\nX(x) = A cos(√λx) + B sin(√λx)\nY(y) = C cos(√(λ - μ)y) + D sin(√(λ - μ)y)\n\nSince the initial condition is given by u(x, y, 0) = cos(3x)sin(2y), we can match the coefficients:\n\nA = 1, B = 0, C = 0, D = 1, √λ = 3, √(λ - μ) = 2\n\nSo, λ = 9 and μ = 5. Now, we have:\n\nX(x) = cos(3x)\nY(y) = sin(2y)\n\nThe remaining equation is:\n\nT'(t) / T(t) = -λ\n\nwhich can be solved by integrating:\n\nT'(t) = -9T(t)\n\nT(t) = E * e^(-9t)\n\nNow, the solution to the heat equation is:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t) = cos(3x)sin(2y)e^(-9t)\n\nAt time t = 0.5, the temperature distribution is:\n\nu(x, y, 0.5) = cos(3x)sin(2y)e^(-9 * 0.5)"
