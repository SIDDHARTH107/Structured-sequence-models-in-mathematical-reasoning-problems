    "message_2": "To encrypt the word \"CRYPTOGRAPHY\" using the Caesar cipher with a shift value of 5, you would shift each letter in the word 5 positions forward in the alphabet. If a letter goes past the letter 'Z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.\n\nHere's the encryption process for each letter:\n\nC -> H\nR -> W\nY -> D\nP -> U\nT -> Y\nO -> T\nG -> L\nR -> W\nA -> F\nP -> U\nH -> M\nY -> D\n\nSo, the encrypted message would be \"HWDUYT LWUFUMD\"."
