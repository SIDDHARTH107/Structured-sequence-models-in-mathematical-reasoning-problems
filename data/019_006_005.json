    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but Deontic logic is a branch of philosophy that deals with the concepts of obligation, permission, and prohibition. It does not typically involve numerical problems for students to solve. If you have a specific topic within mathematics that you would like a numerical problem for, please let me know and I can assist you further.",
    "message_2": "It seems there was a misunderstanding in the initial statement. As a mathematician, I am here to help you with any mathematical problems you may have. Please provide a mathematical problem or topic you would like assistance with, and I will be happy to help."
