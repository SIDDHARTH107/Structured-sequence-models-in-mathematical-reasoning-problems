    "message_2": "To determine whether a complex number is in the Mandelbrot set, we use the iterative formula:\n\nZ(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C\n\nwhere Z(0) = 0, C is the complex number we are testing, and n is the iteration number. In this case, C = -0.12 + 0.85i.\n\nWe will use the escape radius criterion with a critical value of 2. This means that if the magnitude of Z(n) exceeds 2 at any iteration, the complex number is not in the Mandelbrot set.\n\nLet's perform the iterations:\n\n1. Z(1) = Z(0)^2 + C = 0^2 + (-0.12 + 0.85i) = -0.12 + 0.85i\n2. Z(2) = Z(1)^2 + C = (-0.12 + 0.85i)^2 + (-0.12 + 0.85i) = 0.61 - 0.204i\n3. Z(3) = Z(2)^2 + C = (0.61 - 0.204i)^2 + (-0.12 + 0.85i) = -0.194736 + 0.835472i\n4. Z(4) = Z(3)^2 + C = (-0.194736 + 0.835472i)^2 + (-0.12 + 0.85i) = -0.121962 + 0.849998i\n\nNow, let's calculate the magnitude of Z(4):\n\n|Z(4)| = sqrt((-0.121962)^2 + (0.849998)^2) = sqrt(0.014874 + 0.722498) = sqrt(0.737372)\n\nSince the magnitude of Z(4) is still less than 2, we need to continue the iterations. However, there is no fixed maximum number of iterations to determine whether a complex number is in the Mandelbrot set. The number of iterations required depends on the desired level of accuracy and the specific complex number being tested.\n\nIn practice, a maximum number of iterations is often set as a stopping criterion. If the escape radius criterion is not met after the maximum number of iterations, the complex number is considered to be in the Mandelbrot set. The choice of this maximum number of iterations depends on the desired level of accuracy and the computational resources available."
