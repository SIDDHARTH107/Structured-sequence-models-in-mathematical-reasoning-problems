    "message_1": "How many non-isomorphic groups of order 96 exist, and what are they?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 96, we can use the fact that the number of groups of a given order is determined by the number of distinct factorizations of the order into prime powers. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3^1.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the number of abelian groups of a given order, which is the product of the partition numbers of the exponents in the prime factorization. The partition numbers for 5 and 1 are 7 and 1, respectively. So, there are 7 * 1 = 7 abelian groups of order 96.\n\nFor non-abelian groups, we can use the fact that a group of order p^aq^b is solvable if and only if gcd(p-1, q) = 1. In our case, gcd(2-1, 3) = gcd(1, 3) = 1, so all groups of order 96 are solvable. We can use the Sylow theorems to find the number of non-abelian groups.\n\nLet G be a group of order 96, and let n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G. By Sylow's theorems, we have:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3^1 and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). So, n_2 can be 1 or 3.\n2. n_3 divides 2^5 and n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So, n_3 can be 1 or 4.\n\nWe can now consider the possible cases:\n\n1. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 1: This case corresponds to the direct product of the unique Sylow 2-subgroup and the unique Sylow 3-subgroup, which is an abelian group.\n\n2. n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, so G has a normal subgroup of order 32. The quotient group G/N has order 3, so G is an extension of a group of order 3 by a group of order 32. There are two such extensions, one of which is abelian (the direct product) and the other is non-abelian.\n\n3. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1: In this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup, so G has a normal subgroup of order 3. The quotient group G/N has order 32, so G is an extension of a group of order 32 by a group of order 3. There are two such extensions, one of which is abelian (the direct product) and the other is non-abelian.\n\n4. n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4: In this case, there are no normal Sylow subgroups, so we cannot use the extension approach. However, we can use the fact that a group of order 2^5 * 3^1 is solvable to show that there are 5 non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, there are 1 (abelian) + 1 (non-abelian) + 1 (non-abelian) + 5 (non-abelian) = 8 non-isomorphic groups of order 96. These groups are:\n\n1. Z_96 (cyclic group)\n2. Z_2 x Z_48\n3. Z_4 x Z_24\n4. Z_8 x Z_12\n5. Z_16 x Z_6\n6. Z_3 x (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2) (semidirect product)\n7. Z_32 : Z_3 (non-abelian extension)\n8. (Z_4 x Z_4) : Z_3 (non-abelian extension)"
