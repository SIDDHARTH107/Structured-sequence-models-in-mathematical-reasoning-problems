    "message_2": "To simplify the given radical expression, we can first rewrite the expression as a single square root:\n\n√(8) / √(2) = √(8/2)\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction inside the square root:\n\n√(8/2) = √(4)\n\nFinally, we can find the square root of 4:\n\n√(4) = 2\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is 2."
