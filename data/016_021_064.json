    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(1/S)\n\nwhere D is the Hausdorff dimension, N is the number of self-similar pieces, and S is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski arrowhead curve, there are N = 3 self-similar pieces, and each piece is scaled down by a factor of S = 1/2.\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension is:\n\nD = log(3) / log(1/2) â‰ˆ 1.585\n\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski arrowhead curve is approximately 1.59."
