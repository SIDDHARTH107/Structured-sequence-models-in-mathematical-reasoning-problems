    "message_1": "A right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 10 and one leg of length 6. What is the length of the other leg of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In equation form, this is:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nIn this problem, we are given the length of the hypotenuse (c = 10) and the length of one leg (a = 6). We need to find the length of the other leg (b).\n\n10^2 = 6^2 + b^2\n100 = 36 + b^2\n100 - 36 = b^2\n64 = b^2\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides of the equation to find the value of b:\n\nâˆš64 = b\n8 = b\n\nSo, the length of the other leg of the triangle is 8."
