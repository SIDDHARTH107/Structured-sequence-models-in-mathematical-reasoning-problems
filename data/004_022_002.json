    "message_1": "A farmer wants to fence a rectangular piece of land which is adjacent to a river. The side that is adjacent to the river does not need to be fenced, but the other three sides must be fenced. The total fencing material available is 300 meters. What should be the dimensions of the rectangular piece of land that maximize its area?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the side parallel to the river be x meters, and the length of the other two sides perpendicular to the river be y meters each. Since the farmer has 300 meters of fencing material, we can write the constraint equation as:\n\nx + 2y = 300\n\nNow, we need to express the area A of the rectangular piece of land as a function of x and y. The area of a rectangle is given by:\n\nA = x * y\n\nWe want to maximize the area A, so we need to express A in terms of one variable. We can do this by solving the constraint equation for x or y and then substituting it into the area equation. Let's solve for x:\n\nx = 300 - 2y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the area equation:\n\nA(y) = (300 - 2y) * y\nA(y) = 300y - 2y^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A(y) with respect to y and set it equal to zero:\n\ndA/dy = 300 - 4y\n\nNow, set dA/dy = 0 and solve for y:\n\n0 = 300 - 4y\n4y = 300\ny = 75\n\nNow, substitute y back into the expression for x:\n\nx = 300 - 2(75)\nx = 300 - 150\nx = 150\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangular piece of land that maximize its area are 150 meters parallel to the river and 75 meters perpendicular to the river. The maximum area is:\n\nA = 150 * 75 = 11,250 square meters."
