    "message_2": "Let the side length of the square base be x and the height of the box be h. The volume of the box is given by:\n\nV = x^2 * h\n\nSince we want the volume to be 48 cubic feet, we have:\n\n48 = x^2 * h\n\nNow, we need to minimize the surface area of the box, which is given by:\n\nA = x^2 + 4xh\n\nWe can solve for h in terms of x from the volume equation:\n\nh = 48 / x^2\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the surface area equation:\n\nA(x) = x^2 + 4x(48 / x^2)\n\nA(x) = x^2 + 192 / x\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative of A(x) with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dx = 2x - 192 / x^2\n\nTo find the critical points, set dA/dx = 0:\n\n0 = 2x - 192 / x^2\n\nMultiplying both sides by x^2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n0 = 2x^3 - 192\n\nNow, add 192 to both sides and divide by 2:\n\nx^3 = 96\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\nx = 4.584 (approximately)\n\nNow, substitute this value of x back into the equation for h:\n\nh = 48 / x^2\n\nh = 48 / (4.584)^2\n\nh = 2.292 (approximately)\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that minimize the amount of material used to construct it are approximately:\n\nx = 4.584 feet (side length of the square base)\nh = 2.292 feet (height of the box)"
