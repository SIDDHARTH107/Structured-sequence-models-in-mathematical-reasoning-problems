    "message_2": "In a substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another unique letter. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, we need to find the number of ways to map 10 unique letters to 10 other unique letters.\n\nThis is a permutation problem. We have 26 options for the first letter, 25 for the second, 24 for the third, and so on, until we have 17 options for the tenth letter. The number of possible ways to encrypt a message of 10 letters using a substitution cipher can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nWhere n is the total number of elements (26 letters in the alphabet) and r is the number of elements we want to arrange (10 letters in the message).\n\nP(26, 10) = 26! / (26 - 10)!\n\nP(26, 10) = 26! / 16!\n\nP(26, 10) = (26 × 25 × 24 × 23 × 22 × 21 × 20 × 19 × 18 × 17) = 3,315,315,776,000\n\nSo there are 3,315,315,776,000 possible ways to encrypt a message of 10 letters using a substitution cipher, assuming each letter can only be mapped to another unique letter."
