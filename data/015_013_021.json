    "message_2": "The logistic map equation is given by:\n\nxₙ₊₁ = r * xₙ * (1 - xₙ)\n\nwhere r is the parameter and xₙ is the current value in the orbit. To find the first value of x in the orbit when r = 3.8 and x₀ = 0.5, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nx₁ = 3.8 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5)\n\nx₁ = 3.8 * 0.5 * 0.5\n\nx₁ = 0.95\n\nSo, the first value of x that appears in the orbit of the logistic map equation when r = 3.8 and x₀ = 0.5 is x₁ = 0.95."
