    "message_1": "Let p and q be propositional statements with p being true and q being false. Evaluate the truth value of the statement p ^~ q, where \"^\" denotes the logical operator for AND and \"~\" denotes the logical operator for NOT.",
    "message_2": "To evaluate the truth value of the statement p ^ ~q, we first need to find the truth value of ~q. Since q is false, the negation of q, which is ~q, will be true.\n\nNow we have p ^ ~q, where p is true and ~q is true. The AND operator (^) is true only when both of its operands are true. Since both p and ~q are true, the statement p ^ ~q is true."
