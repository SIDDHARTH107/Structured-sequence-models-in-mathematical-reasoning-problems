    "message_1": "A triangle has two sides measuring 5 cm and 7 cm, and the included angle is 60°. Find the area of the triangle.",
    "message_2": "To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle when two sides and the included angle are given:\n\nArea = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the two given sides, and C is the included angle.\n\nIn this case, a = 5 cm, b = 7 cm, and C = 60°.\n\nFirst, we need to find the sine of the included angle:\n\nsin(60°) = √3 / 2\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * 5 * 7 * (√3 / 2)\n\nArea = (1/2) * 35 * (√3 / 2)\n\nArea = 35 * (√3 / 4)\n\nArea ≈ 15.2 cm²\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is approximately 15.2 square centimeters."
