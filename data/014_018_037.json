    "message_2": "If you have both the plaintext and ciphertext for a 5-letter word, you can directly determine the substitution pattern without needing frequency analysis. Since it's a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext corresponds to a unique letter in the ciphertext. \n\nHere's the most efficient method to cryptanalyze the given cipher:\n\n1. Write down the plaintext and ciphertext words, aligning them vertically.\n2. For each pair of corresponding letters, note the substitution (e.g., A -> D, B -> E, etc.).\n3. Create a substitution table using the identified letter mappings.\n4. Use this table to decrypt any other ciphertext encrypted with the same monoalphabetic substitution cipher.\n\nIn this case, frequency analysis is not necessary because you already have a direct mapping between the plaintext and ciphertext. Frequency analysis is more useful when you don't have a known plaintext-ciphertext pair and need to analyze the distribution of letters in the ciphertext to make educated guesses about the substitution pattern."
