    "message_2": "To show that the empty set is a subset of A, we need to prove that every element in the empty set is also an element in A. \n\nThe empty set, denoted by âˆ…, has no elements. Therefore, there are no elements in the empty set that are not in A. Since there are no elements to disprove the claim, it is true by default that every element in the empty set is also an element in A.\n\nHence, the empty set is a subset of A."
