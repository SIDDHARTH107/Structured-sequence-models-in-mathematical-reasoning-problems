If we consider two initial conditions for the Hamiltonian given by $(x_0,y_0,\\dot{x}_0,\\dot{y}_0) = (1,1,0,0)$ and $(x_0,y_0,\\dot{x}_0,\\dot{y}_0) = (1,1.01,0,0)$, compute numerically the time at which the two trajectories diverge by a distance of $10^{-3}$. Use $\\lambda = 1/3$.",
    "message_2": "To compute the time at which the two trajectories diverge by a distance of $10^{-3}$, we first need to set up the Hamiltonian equations of motion for the Henon-Heiles system. The Hamiltonian is given by:\n\n$$H(x,y,\\dot{x},\\dot{y}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2) + V(x,y)$$\n\nThe equations of motion are given by Hamilton's equations:\n\n$$\\dot{x} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_x} = \\dot{x}$$\n$$\\dot{y} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_y} = \\dot{y}$$\n$$\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial x} = -x - 2\\lambda xy$$\n$$\\ddot{y} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial y} = -y - \\lambda x^2 + \\lambda y^2$$\n\nNow, we can use a numerical integration method, such as the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, to solve these equations for the two initial conditions. We will iterate the integration until the distance between the two trajectories reaches $10^{-3}$.\n\nHere is a Python code using the SciPy library to perform the numerical integration:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef henon_heiles(t, state, lambda_):\n    x, y, x_dot, y_dot = state\n    x_ddot = -x - 2 * lambda_ * x * y\n    y_ddot = -y - lambda_ * x**2 + lambda_ * y**2\n    return [x_dot, y_dot, x_ddot, y_ddot]\n\ndef distance(state1, state2):\n    return np.sqrt((state1[0] - state2[0])**2 + (state1[1] - state2[1])**2)\n\nlambda_ = 1/3\ninitial_state1 = [1, 1, 0, 0]\ninitial_state2 = [1, 1.01, 0, 0]\nthreshold = 1e-3\nmax_time = 100\n\ndef stop_condition(t, state, lambda_):\n    state1 = state[:4]\n    state2 = state[4:]\n    return distance(state1, state2) - threshold\n\nstop_condition.terminal = True\nstop_condition.direction = 1\n\ncombined_initial_state = np.concatenate((initial_state1, initial_state2))\nsol = solve_ivp(henon_heiles, (0, max_time), combined_initial_state, args=(lambda_,), events=stop_condition, rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-6)\n\nif sol.status == 1:\n    print(f\"The two trajectories diverge by a distance of 10^(-3) at t = {sol.t_events[0][0]}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The two trajectories did not diverge by a distance of 10^(-3) within the given time range.\")\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the time at which the two trajectories diverge by a distance of $10^{-3}$. Note that the result may depend on the chosen time step and integration method."
