Since 11 is a prime number, we can choose g = 2 (it is a primitive root modulo 11).\n\nNow we need to find x such that:\n\n2^x ≡ 7 (mod 11)\n\nWe can do this by trying different values of x and checking if the equation holds true:\n\n2^1 ≡ 2 (mod 11)\n2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 11)\n2^3 ≡ 8 (mod 11)\n2^4 ≡ 5 (mod 11)\n2^5 ≡ 10 (mod 11)\n2^6 ≡ 9 (mod 11)\n2^7 ≡ 7 (mod 11)\n\nWe found that 2^7 ≡ 7 (mod 11), so the discrete logarithm of 7 (mod 11) is x = 7."
