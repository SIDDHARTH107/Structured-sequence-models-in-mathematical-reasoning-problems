    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a cylindrical container, we need to calculate the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area (the side of the cylinder).\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius. Since the radius is 5 cm, the area of one circular base is:\n\nA = π(5²) = 3.14 × 25 = 78.5 square centimeters\n\nSince there are two bases, the total area of the bases is 2 × 78.5 = 157 square centimeters.\n\nThe lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height. With a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm, the lateral surface area is:\n\nA = 2 × 3.14 × 5 × 10 = 314 square centimeters\n\nNow, to find the total surface area of the container, we add the areas of the bases and the lateral surface:\n\nTotal surface area = 157 + 314 = 471 square centimeters"
