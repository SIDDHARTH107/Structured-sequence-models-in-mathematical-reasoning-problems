    "message_2": "The Koch Island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The Koch curve is constructed by dividing the initial line segment into three equal parts and replacing the middle segment with two segments of the same length, forming an equilateral triangle without the base. This process is repeated for each new segment in the curve.\n\nAt each iteration, the number of segments increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each segment is reduced by a factor of 3. Therefore, after n iterations, the total length of the Koch curve is given by:\n\nLength = (Initial length) * (4^n) / (3^n)\n\nFor the Koch Island, there are three Koch curves, so the total length of the Koch Island after n iterations is:\n\nLength = 3 * (Initial length) * (4^n) / (3^n)\n\nGiven that the initial line segment has a length of 1 unit and we want to find the total length at the 5th iteration:\n\nLength = 3 * (1) * (4^5) / (3^5)\nLength = 3 * (1024) / (243)\nLength = 3072 / 243\nLength â‰ˆ 12.63\n\nSo, the total length of the Koch Island at the 5th iteration is approximately 12.63 units."
