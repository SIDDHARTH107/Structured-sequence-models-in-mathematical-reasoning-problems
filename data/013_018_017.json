    "message_1": "Consider a signaling game where Player 1 can be of two types A and B with equal probability, and Player 2 has to guess the type of Player 1. If Player 2 guesses correctly, they receive a reward of 10. However, Player 2 has to pay a cost of 2 for guessing. If Player 2 guesses incorrectly, they do not receive any reward or penalty. What is the optimal strategy for Player 2 in this game?",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal strategy for Player 2, we need to calculate the expected payoffs for each possible action (guessing A, guessing B, or not guessing).\n\n1. Guessing A:\nSince Player 1 can be of type A or B with equal probability (1/2), the expected payoff for guessing A is:\n\n(1/2) * (Reward for guessing correctly - Cost of guessing) + (1/2) * (Reward for guessing incorrectly)\n= (1/2) * (10 - 2) + (1/2) * 0\n= (1/2) * 8\n= 4\n\n2. Guessing B:\nSimilarly, the expected payoff for guessing B is:\n\n(1/2) * (Reward for guessing correctly - Cost of guessing) + (1/2) * (Reward for guessing incorrectly)\n= (1/2) * (10 - 2) + (1/2) * 0\n= (1/2) * 8\n= 4\n\n3. Not guessing:\nIf Player 2 chooses not to guess, their expected payoff is 0, as they neither receive a reward nor pay a cost.\n\nComparing the expected payoffs for each action, we can see that the optimal strategy for Player 2 is to guess either A or B, as both have an expected payoff of 4, which is higher than the expected payoff of 0 for not guessing."
