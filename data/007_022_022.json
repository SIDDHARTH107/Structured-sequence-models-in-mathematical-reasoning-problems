    "message_2": "To find the number of points in the group generated by the point (2,3) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 5, we need to find the order of the point (2,3). The order of a point P is the smallest positive integer n such that nP = O, where O is the point at infinity (the identity element in the group of points on the elliptic curve).\n\nTo find the order of the point (2,3), we can use the double-and-add algorithm, which is based on the group law for elliptic curves. The algorithm involves repeatedly doubling the point and adding it to itself until we reach the point at infinity.\n\n1. Start with the point P = (2,3).\n2. Double the point P to get 2P.\n3. Add P to 2P to get 3P.\n4. Double 2P to get 4P.\n5. Add P to 4P to get 5P.\n6. Continue this process until we reach the point at infinity.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. P = (2,3)\n2. 2P = (x2, y2)\n   To find the coordinates of 2P, we use the following formulas for point doubling:\n   λ = (3x1^2 + a) / (2y1) mod p\n   x2 = λ^2 - 2x1 mod p\n   y2 = λ(x1 - x2) - y1 mod p\n   where (x1, y1) = P and a = 2 (since our curve is y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 5)\n\n   λ = (3(2)^2 + 2) / (2(3)) mod p\n   λ = (12 + 2) / 6 mod p\n   λ = 14 / 6 mod p\n   λ = 7 / 3 mod p (since we are working with rational numbers, we don't need to worry about the modulus p)\n\n   x2 = (7/3)^2 - 2(2) mod p\n   x2 = 49/9 - 4 mod p\n   x2 = 13/9 mod p\n\n   y2 = 7/3(2 - 13/9) - 3 mod p\n   y2 = 7/3(-1/9) - 3 mod p\n   y2 = -7/27 - 3 mod p\n   y2 = -16/27 mod p\n\n   So, 2P = (13/9, -16/27)\n\n3. 3P = P + 2P = (2,3) + (13/9, -16/27)\n   To find the coordinates of 3P, we use the following formulas for point addition:\n   λ = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) mod p\n   x3 = λ^2 - x1 - x2 mod p\n   y3 = λ(x1 - x3) - y1 mod p\n   where (x1, y1) = P and (x2, y2) = 2P\n\n   λ = (-16/27 - 3) / (13/9 - 2) mod p\n   λ = (-25/27) / (5/9) mod p\n   λ = (-25/27) * (9/5) mod p\n   λ = -15/27 mod p\n   λ = -5/9 mod p\n\n   x3 = (-5/9)^2 - 2 - 13/9 mod p\n   x3 = 25/81 - 18/9 - 13/9 mod p\n   x3 = 25/81 - 31/9 mod p\n   x3 = -4/81 mod p\n\n   y3 = -5/9(2 - (-4/81)) - 3 mod p\n   y3 = -5/9(86/81) - 3 mod p\n   y3 = -430/729 - 3 mod p\n   y3 = -463/729 mod p\n\n   So, 3P = (-4/81, -463/729)\n\nWe can continue this process, but it's clear that the coordinates of the resulting points are becoming more and more complex. In practice, we would use a finite field (i.e., work modulo a prime number p) to simplify the calculations and ensure that the coordinates are integers. However, without knowing the prime number p for the finite field, we cannot determine the exact order of the point (2,3) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 2x + 5."
