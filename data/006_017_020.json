    "message_1": "On a certain highway, the probability of a car accident occurring during rush hour is 0.25. If there are 10 rush hours in a week, what is the probability that at least 3 accidents will occur on this highway during rush hour in a week?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (accidents) in n trials (rush hours)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of a success (accident) in a single trial (rush hour)\n- n is the number of trials (rush hours)\n- k is the number of successes (accidents)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability of at least 3 accidents, so we need to find the sum of probabilities for 3, 4, ..., 10 accidents:\n\nP(X >= 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + ... + P(X = 10)\n\nWe are given:\n- p = 0.25 (probability of an accident during rush hour)\n- n = 10 (number of rush hours in a week)\n\nNow we can calculate the probabilities for each value of k from 3 to 10 and sum them up:\n\nP(X >= 3) = Σ [C(10, k) * (0.25)^k * (0.75)^(10-k)] for k = 3 to 10\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nP(X = 3) = C(10, 3) * (0.25)^3 * (0.75)^7 ≈ 0.2503\nP(X = 4) = C(10, 4) * (0.25)^4 * (0.75)^6 ≈ 0.2816\nP(X = 5) = C(10, 5) * (0.25)^5 * (0.75)^5 ≈ 0.2076\nP(X = 6) = C(10, 6) * (0.25)^6 * (0.75)^4 ≈ 0.1035\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * (0.25)^7 * (0.75)^3 ≈ 0.0345\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * (0.25)^8 * (0.75)^2 ≈ 0.0076\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * (0.25)^9 * (0.75)^1 ≈ 0.0011\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * (0.25)^10 * (0.75)^0 ≈ 0.0001\n\nNow, summing up the probabilities:\n\nP(X >= 3) ≈ 0.2503 + 0.2816 + 0.2076 + 0.1035 + 0.0345 + 0.0076 + 0.0011 + 0.0001 ≈ 0.8853\n\nSo, the probability that at least 3 accidents will occur on this highway during rush hour in a week is approximately 0.8853 or 88.53%."
