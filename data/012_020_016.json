    "message_2": "An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency relation. The automorphism group of a graph is the set of all its automorphisms, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.\n\nFor the given graph, we can find the automorphisms by considering the possible permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relation. Let's denote the vertices as A, B, C, D, and E, corresponding to the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n1. Identity automorphism: (A B C D E) -> (A B C D E)\n2. Swap A and B, C and D: (A B C D E) -> (B A D C E)\n3. Swap A and C, B and D: (A B C D E) -> (C D A B E)\n4. Swap A and D, B and C: (A B C D E) -> (D C B A E)\n5. Swap A and B, E and C: (A B C D E) -> (B A E D C)\n6. Swap A and C, E and D: (A B C D E) -> (C D E A B)\n7. Swap A and D, E and B: (A B C D E) -> (D C E B A)\n8. Swap A and E, B and C: (A B C D E) -> (E B A D C)\n\nThese are all the possible automorphisms that preserve the adjacency relation in the given graph. Therefore, the automorphism group of this graph has 8 elements:\n\nAut(G) = {Identity, (AB)(CD), (AC)(BD), (AD)(BC), (AB)(EC), (AC)(ED), (AD)(EB), (AE)(BC)}"
