    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to find the angles x in the interval $0\\leq x \\leq 2\\pi$ for which the sine function equals $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nRecall that the sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants. The reference angle for which $\\sin(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ (or 30 degrees). \n\nIn the first quadrant, the angle x is equal to the reference angle, so $x_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$.\n\nIn the second quadrant, the angle x is the difference between $\\pi$ and the reference angle, so $x_2 = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for x in the interval $0\\leq x \\leq 2\\pi$ are $x_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ and $x_2 = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$."
