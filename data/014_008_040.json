    "message_2": "The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) processes data in blocks of 128 bits, regardless of the key size (128, 192, or 256 bits). Since the message being encrypted is 128 bits in size, it will fit into one block. Therefore, the message will need to be divided into 1 block for encryption."
