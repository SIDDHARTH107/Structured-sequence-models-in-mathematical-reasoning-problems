The goal is to determine the optimal production plan that minimizes the expected cost of production given the uncertain machine breakdowns. Assuming a budget of $500, the student needs to find:\n\nWhat is the optimal number of products A and B that should be produced to minimize the expected cost of production given the following information:\n- The cost to produce one unit of A is $10 while B is $12.\n- Machine 1 has a 20% chance of breaking down during the production of one unit of A, and a 25% chance of breaking down during the production of one unit of B.\n- Machine 2 has a 15% chance of breaking down during the production of one unit of A, and a 30% chance of breaking down during the production of one unit of B.\n- Machine 3 has a 10% chance of breaking down during the production of one unit of A, and a 20% chance of breaking down during the production of one unit of B.",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal number of products A and B that should be produced to minimize the expected cost of production, we need to consider the expected cost of production for each machine and product combination. We can calculate the expected cost of production for each machine and product combination as follows:\n\nExpected cost of production = (Cost of production) * (1 + Probability of machine breakdown)\n\nMachine 1:\n- Expected cost of producing A: $10 * (1 + 0.20) = $12\n- Expected cost of producing B: $12 * (1 + 0.25) = $15\n\nMachine 2:\n- Expected cost of producing A: $10 * (1 + 0.15) = $11.50\n- Expected cost of producing B: $12 * (1 + 0.30) = $15.60\n\nMachine 3:\n- Expected cost of producing A: $10 * (1 + 0.10) = $11\n- Expected cost of producing B: $12 * (1 + 0.20) = $14.40\n\nNow, we can see that the lowest expected cost of production for product A is $11 using Machine 3, and the lowest expected cost of production for product B is $14.40 using Machine 3.\n\nNext, we need to determine the optimal number of products A and B that can be produced within the budget of $500. Let x be the number of product A and y be the number of product B.\n\nThe cost equation is:\n11x + 14.40y ≤ 500\n\nSince we want to minimize the expected cost of production, we need to maximize the number of products produced within the budget constraint. We can start by finding the maximum number of product A that can be produced within the budget:\n\n11x ≤ 500\nx ≤ 45.45\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a product, the maximum number of product A that can be produced is 45.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of product B that can be produced within the remaining budget:\n\n14.40y ≤ 500 - 11 * 45\ny ≤ 10.42\n\nSince we cannot produce a fraction of a product, the maximum number of product B that can be produced is 10.\n\nTherefore, the optimal production plan to minimize the expected cost of production is to produce 45 units of product A and 10 units of product B using Machine 3."
