    "message_1": "In a game of Chomp, there is a rectangular chocolate bar which is divided into squares. The first player takes a bite from any square in the chocolate bar, and then the second player takes a bite from any square to the right or above the bitten square. The game continues until one player is forced to take the last bite from the bottom right square of the chocolate bar. \n\nSuppose the chocolate bar is 6 x 5 squares. What is the optimal first move for the first player to ensure they win the game?",
    "message_2": "In a game of Chomp, the first player has a winning strategy if the chocolate bar is not a square (i.e., the number of rows is not equal to the number of columns). In this case, the chocolate bar is 6 x 5 squares, so the first player has a winning strategy.\n\nThe optimal first move for the first player is to take a bite from the square that is immediately above the bottom right square (i.e., the square in the 5th row and 6th column). This will leave a 5 x 5 square chocolate bar and a 1 x 5 rectangle above it.\n\nNow, whatever move the second player makes, the first player can mirror that move in the 5 x 5 square, ensuring that they will never be forced to take the last bite from the bottom right square. This strategy guarantees a win for the first player."
