    "message_2": "To determine the lowest level of magnification needed to display the entire Mandelbrot set within its boundaries, we need to consider the dimensions of the set. The hint provided gives us the diameter of the cardioid (0.5) and the distance from its tip to the origin (1.5).\n\nThe Mandelbrot set extends horizontally from approximately -2 to 1 on the real axis, giving it a width of 3 units. Vertically, it extends approximately 1.25 units above and below the imaginary axis, giving it a height of 2.5 units.\n\nNow, let's assume we have a square satellite image with a side length of L units. To fit the entire Mandelbrot set within the image, we need the magnification level M to satisfy the following conditions:\n\nL * M >= 3 (width)\nL * M >= 2.5 (height)\n\nSince we want the lowest level of magnification, we can set L * M = 3 and L * M = 2.5 for the width and height, respectively. Dividing the second equation by the first equation, we get:\n\n(2.5 / 3) = (L * M) / (L * M)\n2.5 / 3 = 5 / 6\n\nThus, the lowest level of magnification M at which a satellite image can display the entire Mandelbrot set within its boundaries is 5/6 or approximately 0.833 to three significant figures."
