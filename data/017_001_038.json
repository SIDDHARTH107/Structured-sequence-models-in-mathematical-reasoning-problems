    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 4, and let e be the identity element of G. Since the order of G is 4, there are 3 non-identity elements in G. Let's denote these elements as a, b, and c.\n\nNow, consider the orders of these elements. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of an element must divide the order of the group. Since the order of G is 4, the possible orders for a, b, and c are 1, 2, or 4. However, the order of an element can only be 1 if it is the identity element, and a, b, and c are not the identity element. Therefore, the possible orders for a, b, and c are 2 or 4.\n\nCase 1: There exists an element of order 4.\nSuppose, without loss of generality, that the order of a is 4. Then, G = {e, a, a^2, a^3}, and G is a cyclic group generated by a. Thus, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4.\n\nCase 2: All non-identity elements have order 2.\nSuppose that the orders of a, b, and c are all 2. Then, a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e. Now, consider the product of two distinct non-identity elements, say ab. Since a and b are distinct, ab cannot be equal to a or b. Also, (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = ee = e, so ab cannot be equal to e. Therefore, ab must be equal to the third non-identity element, c. Similarly, we can show that ac = b and bc = a.\n\nThus, G = {e, a, b, c} with the following multiplication table:\n\n```\n  e a b c\ne e a b c\na a e c b\nb b c e a\nc c b a e\n```\n\nThis multiplication table corresponds to the Klein four-group V4. Therefore, G is isomorphic to V4.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, as it either has an element of order 4 or two elements of order 2."
