The treewidth is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions.\n\nA possible tree decomposition for the given graph is:\n\nT1: {1, 2, 3}\nT2: {2, 4, 5}\nT3: {3, 5, 6}\nT4: {5, 7, 8}\n\nThe tree decomposition can be visualized as:\n\n      T1\n     /  \\\n   T2    T3\n    |\n   T4\n\nNow, we determine the width of the tree decomposition. The width is the size of the largest bag minus 1. In this case, all bags have 3 vertices, so the width is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the treewidth of the given graph is 2."
