    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 27. By the Sylow theorems, there must exist a Sylow 3-subgroup P of G, which is a subgroup of order 3^3 = 27. Since the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is congruent to 1 mod 3 and divides the order of G, there are either 1 or 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. \n\nCase 1: There is only 1 Sylow 3-subgroup.\nIn this case, P is a normal subgroup of G. Since P has order 27, it must have an element of order 3 (by Cauchy's theorem) and an element of order 9 (by the fact that the order of an element divides the order of the group). Thus, G has elements of order 3 and 9. Since P is normal and has the same order as G, we have G ≅ P, and G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27.\n\nCase 2: There are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups.\nLet P and Q be two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups of G. Since the intersection of distinct Sylow p-subgroups is trivial, we have |P ∩ Q| = 1. Now, consider the set PQ = {pq : p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. Since |P| = |Q| = 27, we have |PQ| = 27^2 / |P ∩ Q| = 729. However, since G has only 27 elements, there must be some nontrivial overlap between the elements of P and Q. \n\nLet x be an element of order 9 in P. Then, x^3 is an element of order 3 in P. Since P and Q have nontrivial intersection, there exists an element y in Q such that y = x^3. Then, x = y^3, so x is also an element of order 9 in Q. Thus, G has elements of order 3 and 9.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by x and y. Since x and y have orders 9 and 3, respectively, we have |H| = 9 * 3 = 27. Thus, H = G. Since G has elements of order 3 and 9, it cannot be a cyclic group. Therefore, G is a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nIn conclusion, G must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C27 or the non-abelian group of order 27."
