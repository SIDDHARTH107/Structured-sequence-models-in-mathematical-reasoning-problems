It has a daily supply of 200 units of product A, 250 units of product B, and 150 units of product C. The factory wants to distribute these products to three warehouses - X, Y, and Z. The daily demand of warehouse X is 100 units of product A, 80 units of product B, and 40 units of product C. The daily demand of warehouse Y is 60 units of product A, 120 units of product B, and 80 units of product C. The daily demand of warehouse Z is 80 units of product A, 50 units of product B, and 30 units of product C.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of units of each product that can be distributed daily, given that each warehouse can only hold a maximum of 150 units of products and the transportation cost per unit of product A, B, and C is $4,$ $3,$ and $2,$ respectively?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of units of each product that can be distributed daily, we need to consider the supply, demand, and warehouse capacity constraints.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total demand for each product:\n\nProduct A: 100 (X) + 60 (Y) + 80 (Z) = 240 units\nProduct B: 80 (X) + 120 (Y) + 50 (Z) = 250 units\nProduct C: 40 (X) + 80 (Y) + 30 (Z) = 150 units\n\nNow, let's check if the supply can meet the demand:\n\nProduct A: 200 (supply) >= 240 (demand) - Not enough supply\nProduct B: 250 (supply) >= 250 (demand) - Enough supply\nProduct C: 150 (supply) >= 150 (demand) - Enough supply\n\nSince there is not enough supply for product A, we need to find the maximum number of units that can be distributed daily considering the warehouse capacity constraints.\n\nLet's denote the number of units of product A distributed to each warehouse as Ax, Ay, and Az. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. Ax + Ay + Az <= 200 (supply constraint)\n2. Ax <= 100 (demand constraint for warehouse X)\n3. Ay <= 60 (demand constraint for warehouse Y)\n4. Az <= 80 (demand constraint for warehouse Z)\n5. Ax + 80 <= 150 (warehouse X capacity constraint)\n6. Ay + 120 <= 150 (warehouse Y capacity constraint)\n7. Az + 50 <= 150 (warehouse Z capacity constraint)\n\nNow, let's solve the constraints:\n\nFrom constraint 5, Ax <= 70\nFrom constraint 6, Ay <= 30\nFrom constraint 7, Az <= 100\n\nSince Ax + Ay + Az <= 200, the maximum number of units of product A that can be distributed daily is 70 + 30 + 100 = 200 units.\n\nSo, the maximum number of units of each product that can be distributed daily is:\n\nProduct A: 200 units\nProduct B: 250 units\nProduct C: 150 units"
