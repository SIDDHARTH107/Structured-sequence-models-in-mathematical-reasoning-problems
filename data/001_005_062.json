    "message_2": "To find the roots of the quadratic equation 2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 2, b = -5, and c = 2.\n\nx = (5 ± √((-5)² - 4(2)(2))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (5 ± √(25 - 16)) / 4\n\nx = (5 ± √9) / 4\n\nx = (5 ± 3) / 4\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n\nx = (5 + 3) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2\n\nx = (5 - 3) / 4 = 2 / 4 = 1/2\n\nSo, the roots of the quadratic equation 2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0 are x = 2 and x = 1/2."
