    "message_1": "Consider a beauty contest where each participant has to select a number between 0 and 100. The winner is the person whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average of all numbers submitted by all contestants. \n\nIf there are 10 participants in the contest, what number should you select to optimize your chances of winning?",
    "message_2": "To optimize your chances of winning, you should assume that the other participants are also trying to optimize their chances. Let's denote the numbers chosen by the participants as x1, x2, ..., x10, where x1 is your number and x2, ..., x10 are the numbers chosen by the other participants.\n\nThe average of all numbers submitted by the contestants is:\n\n(1/10) * (x1 + x2 + ... + x10)\n\nThe target number to win is two-thirds of the average:\n\n(2/3) * (1/10) * (x1 + x2 + ... + x10)\n\nSince the other participants are also trying to optimize their chances, they will also choose numbers close to two-thirds of the average. Therefore, we can assume that x2, x3, ..., x10 are also close to (2/3) * (1/10) * (x1 + x2 + ... + x10).\n\nLet's denote the average of x2, x3, ..., x10 as A. Then, we can write:\n\nA ≈ (2/3) * (1/10) * (x1 + A)\n\nNow, we can solve for x1:\n\nx1 ≈ 10 * (2/3) * A - A\n\nx1 ≈ (20/3) * A - A\n\nx1 ≈ (20/3 - 1) * A\n\nx1 ≈ (17/3) * A\n\nSince A is the average of x2, x3, ..., x10, and they are all between 0 and 100, we can assume that A is also between 0 and 100. Therefore, to optimize your chances of winning, you should choose a number close to (17/3) * A, where A is between 0 and 100.\n\nIf we assume that the other participants choose numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 100, then the expected value of A is 50. In this case, you should choose a number close to (17/3) * 50 ≈ 283.33. However, this number is outside the allowed range of 0 to 100.\n\nSince the optimal strategy for all participants is to choose a number close to two-thirds of the average, the actual expected value of A will be lower than 50. In this case, you should choose a number close to (17/3) * A, where A is between 0 and 100, but closer to the lower end of the range.\n\nA reasonable estimate for A in this case is around 33.33 (two-thirds of 50). Then, you should choose a number close to (17/3) * 33.33 ≈ 188.89. Again, this number is outside the allowed range of 0 to 100.\n\nAs the participants continue to adjust their strategies, the expected value of A will approach a stable value. In this case, the optimal number to choose will be close to two-thirds of that stable value. Through iterative reasoning, the expected value of A converges to around 25, and the optimal number to choose is close to (17/3) * 25 ≈ 141.67. However, this number is still outside the allowed range of 0 to 100.\n\nAs the participants continue to adjust their strategies, the expected value of A will approach a stable value. In this case, the optimal number to choose will be close to two-thirds of that stable value. Through iterative reasoning, the expected value of A converges to around 20, and the optimal number to choose is close to (17/3) * 20 ≈ 113.33. However, this number is still outside the allowed range of 0 to 100.\n\nAs the participants continue to adjust their strategies, the expected value of A will approach a stable value. In this case, the optimal number to choose will be close to two-thirds of that stable value. Through iterative reasoning, the expected value of A converges to around 15, and the optimal number to choose is close to (17/3) * 15 ≈ 85.\n\nTherefore, to optimize your chances of winning, you should choose a number close to 85."
