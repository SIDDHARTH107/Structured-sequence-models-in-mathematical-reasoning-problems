    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the periodic extension of f(x) with period 4, we first need to find the Fourier coefficients a_n and b_n. Since f(x) is an odd function, all a_n coefficients will be zero. We only need to find the b_n coefficients.\n\nThe formula for b_n is:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nπx/L)] dx, where L is half the period (in this case, L = 2).\n\nFor n = 1, 2, 3, ... we have:\n\nb_n = (1/2) * [∫[-1 * sin(nπx/2)] dx from 0 to 2 + ∫[1 * sin(nπx/2)] dx from -2 to 0]\n\nb_n = (1/2) * [(-2/nπ) * (cos(nπx/2)) from 0 to 2 + (2/nπ) * (cos(nπx/2)) from -2 to 0]\n\nb_n = (1/2) * [(-2/nπ) * (cos(nπ) - 1) + (2/nπ) * (1 - cos(-nπ))]\n\nSince cos(nπ) = (-1)^n and cos(-nπ) = (-1)^n, we get:\n\nb_n = (1/2) * [(-2/nπ) * ((-1)^n - 1) + (2/nπ) * (1 - (-1)^n)]\n\nNow, we can find the first four non-zero terms of the Fourier series:\n\nb_1 = (1/2) * [(-2/π) * (0) + (2/π) * (2)] = 2/π\nb_2 = (1/2) * [(-2/2π) * (-1) + (2/2π) * (0)] = -1/π\nb_3 = (1/2) * [(-2/3π) * (0) + (2/3π) * (2)] = 2/3π\nb_4 = (1/2) * [(-2/4π) * (-1) + (2/4π) * (0)] = -1/2π\n\nThe first four non-zero terms of the Fourier series are:\n\nf(x) ≈ (2/π) * sin(πx/2) - (1/π) * sin(2πx/2) + (2/3π) * sin(3πx/2) - (1/2π) * sin(4πx/2)"
