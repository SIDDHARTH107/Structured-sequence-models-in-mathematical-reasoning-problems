    "message_2": "First, we need to rewrite the given system of linear equations in matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2  1 |      x = | x |      b = | 14 |\n    | 2  5  3 |          | y |          | 26 |\n    | 0  3  7 |          | z |          | 47 |\n\nNow, we will perform Cholesky decomposition on matrix A. Cholesky decomposition is a method used for symmetric positive definite matrices, which decomposes a matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. In this case, A = LL^T, where L is a lower triangular matrix and L^T is its transpose.\n\nHowever, the given matrix A is not symmetric, so we cannot apply Cholesky decomposition directly. We need to modify the problem to fit the requirements of Cholesky decomposition.\n\nOne way to do this is to multiply both sides of the equation Ax = b by A^T (transpose of A) to get a symmetric positive definite matrix:\n\nA^T * A * x = A^T * b\n\nA^T = | 3  2  0 |\n      | 2  5  3 |\n      | 1  3  7 |\n\nNow, let's compute A^T * A and A^T * b:\n\nA^T * A = | 3  2  0 |   | 3  2  1 |   | 14  12  2 |\n          | 2  5  3 | * | 2  5  3 | = | 12  29 20 |\n          | 1  3  7 |   | 0  3  7 |   |  2  20 50 |\n\nA^T * b = | 3  2  0 |   | 14 |\n          | 2  5  3 | * | 26 | = | 70 |\n          | 1  3  7 |   | 47 |   | 193 |\n\nNow, we have a new system of linear equations:\n\n14x + 12y + 2z = 70\n12x + 29y + 20z = 193\n2x + 20y + 50z = 193\n\nNow, we can apply Cholesky decomposition on the matrix A^T * A:\n\nA^T * A = LL^T\n\nL = | √14      0      0 |\n    | 12/√14  √5      0 |\n    |  2/√14  16/√5  √2 |\n\nL^T = | √14  12/√14   2/√14 |\n      |   0    √5    16/√5 |\n      |   0     0      √2  |\n\nNow, we can solve the system of linear equations using forward and backward substitution:\n\n1.
