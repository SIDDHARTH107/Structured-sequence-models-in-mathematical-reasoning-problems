    "message_2": "In a 3-event sequence, we can calculate the number of possible orderings using the concept of permutations. The formula for calculating the number of permutations (orderings) of n events is given by:\n\nP(n) = n!\n\nWhere n! (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nFor a 3-event sequence, we have n = 3. Therefore, the number of possible orderings is:\n\nP(3) = 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 possible orderings of events in a 3-event sequence using temporal logic."
