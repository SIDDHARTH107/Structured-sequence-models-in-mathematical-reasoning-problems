    "message_2": "To graph the quadratic equation y = -2x² + 4x - 1, we need to find the y-coordinates for at least three different x-coordinates. Let's choose x = -1, x = 0, and x = 1 for simplicity.\n\n1. For x = -1:\ny = -2(-1)² + 4(-1) - 1\ny = -2(1) - 4 - 1\ny = -2 - 4 - 1\ny = -7\nSo, the point is (-1, -7).\n\n2. For x = 0:\ny = -2(0)² + 4(0) - 1\ny = 0 + 0 - 1\ny = -1\nSo, the point is (0, -1).\n\n3. For x = 1:\ny = -2(1)² + 4(1) - 1\ny = -2(1) + 4 - 1\ny = -2 + 4 - 1\ny = 1\nSo, the point is (1, 1).\n\nNow, we have three points: (-1, -7), (0, -1), and (1, 1). Plot these points on the coordinate plane and connect them with a smooth curve to graph the quadratic equation y = -2x² + 4x - 1."
