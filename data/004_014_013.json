    "message_2": "To find the volume of the cylindrical tank using integration, we can consider the tank as a series of infinitesimally thin circular disks stacked on top of each other. The volume of each disk can be found using the formula for the area of a circle (πr^2) multiplied by its infinitesimal thickness (dy). Then, we can integrate the volume of these disks over the height of the tank to find the total volume.\n\nLet's set up the integral:\n\nV = ∫[πr^2 dy]\n\nSince the radius of the tank is constant (5 meters), we can treat it as a constant in the integral:\n\nV = π(5^2) ∫[dy]\n\nNow, we need to integrate with respect to y over the height of the tank, which ranges from 0 to 10 meters:\n\nV = π(5^2) [∫(dy) from y=0 to y=10]\n\nIntegrating dy gives us y:\n\nV = π(5^2) [y] evaluated from y=0 to y=10\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nV = π(5^2) (10 - 0)\n\nV = π(25)(10)\n\nV = 250π\n\nThe volume of the tank is 250π cubic meters, or approximately 785.4 cubic meters when filled to the top."
