    "message_2": "To solve the cubic equation $2x^3-3x^2-11x+6=0$, we can first try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has a rational root, it must be of the form $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is 6 and the leading coefficient is 2. The factors of 6 are ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6, and the factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±1/2, and ±3/2.\n\nNow, we can test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation:\n\n- $f(1) = 2(1)^3 - 3(1)^2 - 11(1) + 6 = -6 \\neq 0$\n- $f(-1) = 2(-1)^3 - 3(-1)^2 - 11(-1) + 6 = 4 \\neq 0$\n- $f(2) = 2(2)^3 - 3(2)^2 - 11(2) + 6 = 2 \\neq 0$\n- $f(-2) = 2(-2)^3 - 3(-2)^2 - 11(-2) + 6 = 0$\n\nWe found a rational root: $x = -2$. Now, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n$(2x^3 - 3x^2 - 11x + 6) \\div (x + 2) = 2x^2 - 7x + 3$\n\nNow, we have the quadratic equation $2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0$. We can solve this using the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a = 2$, $b = -7$, and $c = 3$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(2)(3)}}{2(2)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 24}}{4}$\n\n$x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{4}$\n\n$x = \\frac{7 \\pm 5}{4}$\n\nSo, the two other roots are $x = \\frac{7 + 5}{4} = 3$ and $x = \\frac{7 - 5}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation $2x^3-3x^2-11x+6=0$ are $x = -2$, $x = 3$, and $x = \\frac{1}{2}$."
