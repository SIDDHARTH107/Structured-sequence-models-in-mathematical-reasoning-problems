    "message_2": "Let x be the side length of the square cut from each corner of the cardboard. After cutting out the squares and folding up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be (10-2x) by (12-2x) by x. The volume of the box, V, can be represented as:\n\nV(x) = x(10-2x)(12-2x)\n\nWe want to find the maximum volume of the box with the constraint that the volume must be at least 150 cubic inches. First, let's find the critical points of the volume function by taking the first derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n\nV'(x) = dV/dx = (10-2x)(12-2x) - 2x(10-2x) - 2x(12-2x)\n\nExpanding and simplifying the expression:\n\nV'(x) = -8x^3 + 44x^2 - 72x\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term -4x:\n\nV'(x) = -4x(2x^2 - 11x + 18)\n\nNext, we can factor the quadratic:\n\nV'(x) = -4x(2x-9)(x-2)\n\nSetting V'(x) equal to zero, we find the critical points:\n\n-4x(2x-9)(x-2) = 0\n\nx = 0, x = 9/2, x = 2\n\nSince x = 0 and x = 9/2 correspond to the original flat cardboard and a degenerate box with no height, respectively, we can discard these solutions. Thus, the only critical point of interest is x = 2 inches.\n\nNow, we need to check if this critical point corresponds to a maximum volume. We can do this by analyzing the second derivative:\n\nV''(x) = d^2V/dx^2 = -24x^2 + 88x - 72\n\nEvaluating the second derivative at x = 2:\n\nV''(2) = -24(2)^2 + 88(2) - 72 = -96 + 176 - 72 = 8\n\nSince V''(2) > 0, the critical point x = 2 corresponds to a local minimum. However, we are looking for a maximum volume with the constraint that the volume must be at least 150 cubic inches. To satisfy this constraint, we can evaluate the volume function at x = 2:\n\nV(2) = 2(10-2(2))(12-2(2)) = 2(6)(8) = 96 cubic inches\n\nSince the volume at x = 2 is less than 150 cubic inches, we need to find the smallest x value that satisfies the constraint. We can set the volume function equal to 150 and solve for x:\n\n150 = x(10-2x)(12-2x)\n\nThis equation is difficult to solve algebraically, so we can use numerical methods or graphing to find the smallest x value that satisfies the constraint. Using a graphing calculator or software, we find that the smallest x value that satisfies the constraint is approximately x ≈ 1.29 inches.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum volume of the box with the constraint by plugging this x value back into the volume function:\n\nV(1.29) ≈ 1.29(10-2(1.29))(12-2(1.29)) ≈ 1.29(7.42)(9.42) ≈ 89.98 cubic inches\n\nTherefore, the maximum volume of the box with the constraint that the box must have a capacity of at least 150 cubic inches is approximately 89.98 cubic inches."
