    "message_2": "To determine if X is connected, we need to check if there are any non-empty, disjoint open sets whose union is X. If there are, then X is not connected.\n\nConsider the open sets {a, b} and {c, d, e} in τ. Their union is X, and they are disjoint and non-empty. Therefore, X is not connected.\n\nNow let's check if X is path-connected. A space is path-connected if for any two points x, y in X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nLet's try to find a path between a and c. We can define a function f: [0, 1] → X as follows:\n\nf(t) = a for t ∈ [0, 1/2)\nf(t) = c for t ∈ [1/2, 1]\n\nNow we need to check if f is continuous. The inverse images of open sets in X under f should be open sets in the subspace topology of [0, 1]. Let's consider the open set {c, d, e} in X. The inverse image of {c, d, e} under f is [1/2, 1], which is not an open set in the subspace topology of [0, 1] (since it does not contain an open interval around 1/2). Therefore, f is not continuous, and there is no continuous path between a and c.\n\nSince we cannot find a continuous path between a and c, X is not path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, X is neither connected nor path-connected."
