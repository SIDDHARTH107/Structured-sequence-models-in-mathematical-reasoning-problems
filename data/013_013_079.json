    "message_1": "Sure, here's a problem:\n\nIn a sealed bid second-price auction, four bidders submit their sealed bids for a rare antique vase. The bids (in dollars) are 120, 150, 180, and 200. What is the winning bid and how much does the winner pay for the vase assuming that the auction format declares the winner as the bidder who submits the highest bid and pays the second-highest bid?",
    "message_2": "In a sealed bid second-price auction, the winner is the bidder with the highest bid, but they pay the amount of the second-highest bid. In this case, the bids are 120, 150, 180, and 200.\n\nThe highest bid is 200 dollars, and the second-highest bid is 180 dollars. Therefore, the winning bid is 200 dollars, but the winner pays 180 dollars for the rare antique vase."
