    "message_2": "Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p ≡ a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p. \n\nWe can rewrite this theorem as a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) when a and p are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the remainder when 7^80 is divided by 13. Since 7 and 13 are coprime, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n7^(13-1) ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\n7^12 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nNow, we can rewrite 7^80 as (7^12)^(80/12):\n\n7^80 = (7^12)^6\n\nSince 7^12 ≡ 1 (mod 13), we have:\n\n(7^12)^6 ≡ 1^6 (mod 13)\n\n1^6 ≡ 1 (mod 13)\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^80 is divided by 13 is 1."
