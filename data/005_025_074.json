    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. In this case, the sample size is 36, which is large enough to apply the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- Population mean (μ) = 200 grams\n- Population standard deviation (σ) = 5 grams\n- Sample size (n) = 36 boxes\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σx̄), which is calculated as:\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nσx̄ = 5 / √36 = 5 / 6 = 0.8333 grams\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the average weight of the 36 boxes (x̄) is less than 195 grams. To do this, we will use the z-score formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / σx̄\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nz = (195 - 200) / 0.8333 = -5 / 0.8333 ≈ -6\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -6. Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score less than -6 is extremely close to 0 (practically 0).\n\nSo, the probability that the average weight of the 36 boxes is less than 195 grams is approximately 0 or virtually impossible."
