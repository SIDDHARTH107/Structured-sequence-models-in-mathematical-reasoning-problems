    "message_1": "A tree stands at a distance of 30 meters from a person. If the angle of elevation from the person's eyes to the top of the tree is 45 degrees, what is the height of the tree?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. Specifically, we can use the tangent function, which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is the height of the tree (h), and the adjacent side is the distance from the person to the tree (30 meters). The angle of elevation is 45 degrees.\n\nSo, we have:\n\ntan(45Â°) = h / 30\n\nSince the tangent of 45 degrees is 1:\n\n1 = h / 30\n\nNow, we can solve for the height of the tree (h):\n\nh = 1 * 30\nh = 30 meters\n\nThe height of the tree is 30 meters."
