    "message_1": "What is the probability that out of a group of 80 people, at least 20 people will be affected by a disease, given that the probability of a person from this group being affected by the disease is 0.25?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k people being affected by the disease\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of people (80 in this case)\n- k is the number of people affected by the disease (we want to find the probability of at least 20 people being affected)\n- p is the probability of a person being affected by the disease (0.25 in this case)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of at least 20 people being affected, we need to find the sum of probabilities for k = 20, 21, 22, ..., 80.\n\nP(X >= 20) = P(X = 20) + P(X = 21) + ... + P(X = 80)\n\nCalculating this sum directly can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can find the complement of this probability, which is the probability of fewer than 20 people being affected:\n\nP(X < 20) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + ... + P(X = 19)\n\nThen, we can find the probability of at least 20 people being affected by subtracting this value from 1:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - P(X < 20)\n\nNow, we can calculate P(X < 20):\n\nP(X < 20) = Σ [C(80, k) * (0.25)^k * (0.75)^(80-k)] for k = 0 to 19\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute this sum, we get:\n\nP(X < 20) ≈ 0.0574\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 20 people being affected:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) ≈ 1 - 0.0574 ≈ 0.9426\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 people out of the group of 80 will be affected by the disease is approximately 0.9426 or 94.26%."
