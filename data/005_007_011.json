Here are the data points:\n\n| Hours studied per week | Grades |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| 6                     | 70     |\n| 7                     | 77     |\n| 8                     | 83     |\n| 5                     | 60     |\n| 4                     | 50     |\n| 9                     | 90     |\n| 10                    | 95     |\n| 12                    | 100    |\n\nFind the correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied per week and the corresponding grades.",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r) between the number of hours studied per week and the corresponding grades, we will use the following formula:\n\nr = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² * Σ(yi - ȳ)²]\n\nwhere xi and yi are individual data points, x̄ is the mean of x values, and ȳ is the mean of y values.\n\nFirst, let's find the mean of x (hours studied) and y (grades):\n\nx̄ = (6 + 7 + 8 + 5 + 4 + 9 + 10 + 12) / 8 = 61 / 8 = 7.625\nȳ = (70 + 77 + 83 + 60 + 50 + 90 + 95 + 100) / 8 = 625 / 8 = 78.125\n\nNext, we will calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula:\n\nΣ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] = (6-7.625)(70-78.125) + (7-7.625)(77-78.125) + (8-7.625)(83-78.125) + (5-7.625)(60-78.125) + (4-7.625)(50-78.125) + (9-7.625)(90-78.125) + (10-7.625)(95-78.125) + (12-7.625)(100-78.125) = -1.625 * -8.125 + (-0.625) * -1.125 + 0.375 * 4.875 + (-2.625) * -18.125 + (-3.625) * -28.125 + 1.375 * 11.875 + 2.375 * 16.875 + 4.375 * 21.875 = 13.203125 + 0.703125 + 1.828125 + 47.578125 + 101.953125 + 16.328125 + 40.078125 + 95.703125 = 316.375\n\nΣ(xi - x̄)² = (-1.625)² + (-0.625)² + 0.375² + (-2.625)² + (-3.625)² + 1.375² + 2.375² + 4.375² = 2.640625 + 0.390625 + 0.140625 + 6.890625 + 13.140625 + 1.890625 + 5.640625 + 19.140625 = 49.875\n\nΣ(yi - ȳ)² = (-8.125)² + (-1.125)² + 4.875² + (-18.125)² + (-28.125)² + 11.875² + 16.875² + 21.875² = 66.015625 + 1.265625 + 23.765625 + 328.515625 + 791.015625 + 141.015625 + 284.765625 + 478.515625 = 2114.875\n\nNow, we can calculate the correlation coefficient:\n\nr = 316.375 / √(49.875 * 2114.875) = 316.375 / √(105593.828125) = 316.375 / 325.284 = 0.9725\n\nThe correlation coefficient between the number of hours studied per week and the corresponding grades is approximately 0.9725. This indicates a strong positive correlation between the two variables."
