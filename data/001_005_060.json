    "message_2": "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = 5, and c = -6. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(5) ± √((5)^2 - 4(1)(-6))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 2\n\nx = (-5 ± √49) / 2\n\nx = (-5 ± 7) / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (-5 + 7) / 2\nx = 2 / 2\nx = 1\n\nand\n\nx = (-5 - 7) / 2\nx = -12 / 2\nx = -6\n\nSo, the solutions for the equation x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0 are x = 1 and x = -6."
