The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.\n\nA ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's prove that A ∩ B is a subset of set A and set B.\n\nBy definition, a set C is a subset of a set D (denoted as C ⊆ D) if every element of C is also an element of D.\n\n1. A ∩ B ⊆ A:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of A. Since A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}, we can see that all of these elements are also in set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Therefore, A ∩ B is a subset of A.\n\n2. A ∩ B ⊆ B:\n\nFor every element x in A ∩ B, x must also be an element of B. Since A ∩ B = {3, 4, 5}, we can see that all of these elements are also in set B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
