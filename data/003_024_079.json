    "message_1": "Suppose you have two vectors: vector A is 6 units long, pointing in the direction (2,3), and vector B is 8 units long, pointing in the direction (-1,2). Using trigonometry, find the projection of vector A onto vector B.",
    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B, we first need to find the angle between the two vectors. We can do this using the dot product formula and the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\nThe dot product of two vectors A and B is given by:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, and θ is the angle between them.\n\nFirst, let's find the unit vectors in the direction of A and B:\n\nUnit vector of A = (2/√(2^2 + 3^2), 3/√(2^2 + 3^2)) = (2/√13, 3/√13)\nUnit vector of B = (-1/√((-1)^2 + 2^2), 2/√((-1)^2 + 2^2)) = (-1/√5, 2/√5)\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of the unit vectors:\n\nUnit vector A · Unit vector B = (2/√13)(-1/√5) + (3/√13)(2/√5) = (-2 + 6)/(√13√5) = 4/(√13√5)\n\nNow, we can find the angle θ using the dot product formula:\n\ncos(θ) = (Unit vector A · Unit vector B) / (|Unit vector A| |Unit vector B|)\ncos(θ) = (4/(√13√5)) / (1 * 1) = 4/(√13√5)\n\nNow, we can find the projection of vector A onto vector B using the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = |A| cos(θ) * Unit vector of B\nProjection of A onto B = 6 * (4/(√13√5)) * (-1/√5, 2/√5)\nProjection of A onto B = (6 * 4/13) * (-1/√5, 2/√5)\nProjection of A onto B = (24/13) * (-1/√5, 2/√5)\n\nSo, the projection of vector A onto vector B is (-24/13√5, 48/13√5)."
