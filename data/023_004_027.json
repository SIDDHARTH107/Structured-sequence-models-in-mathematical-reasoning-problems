    "message_2": "To find the Fourier transform of the given function, we'll use the definition of the continuous Fourier transform:\n\nF(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} f(t) * e^(-jωt) dt\n\nwhere F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), ω is the angular frequency, and j is the imaginary unit (j^2 = -1).\n\nGiven the function f(t) = cos(2πt) + sin(4πt), we can break the Fourier transform into two parts:\n\nF(ω) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} [cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt) + sin(4πt) * e^(-jωt)] dt\n\nNow, we can solve each integral separately:\n\n∫_{-∞}^{∞} cos(2πt) * e^(-jωt) dt = (1/2) * [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)]\n\n∫_{-∞}^{∞} sin(4πt) * e^(-jωt) dt = (-j/2) * [δ(ω - 4π) - δ(ω + 4π)]\n\nHere, δ(ω) is the Dirac delta function, which is zero everywhere except at ω = 0, where it is infinite, and its integral over the entire real line is equal to 1.\n\nNow, we can combine the two integrals to find the Fourier transform of the original function:\n\nF(ω) = (1/2) * [δ(ω - 2π) + δ(ω + 2π)] + (-j/2) * [δ(ω - 4π) - δ(ω + 4π)]\n\nThis is the Fourier transform of the given function f(t) = cos(2πt) + sin(4πt) over the range of t = -∞ to t = ∞."
