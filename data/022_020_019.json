    "message_2": "This is a second-order homogeneous linear differential equation. The general solution can be found by solving the characteristic equation:\n\n$$\nr^2 + 1 = 0\n$$\n\nThis equation has two complex roots: $r_1 = i$ and $r_2 = -i$. Therefore, the general solution for the differential equation is:\n\n$$\ny(x) = C_1 \\cos(x) + C_2 \\sin(x)\n$$\n\nNow we need to apply the boundary conditions to find the specific solution:\n\n1. $y(0) = 0$:\n\n$$\n0 = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) \\Rightarrow C_1 = 0\n$$\n\n2. $y(1) = 1$:\n\n$$\n1 = C_2 \\sin(1)\n$$\n\nSince $\\sin(1) \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\sin(1)$:\n\n$$\nC_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sin(1)}\n$$\n\nThus, the specific solution that satisfies the boundary value problem is:\n\n$$\ny(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(1)} \\sin(x)\n$$"
