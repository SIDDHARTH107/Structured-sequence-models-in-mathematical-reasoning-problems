    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method, we first need to write the augmented matrix:\n\n[ 2  3 | 7 ]\n[ 4  6 | 14 ]\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form. We can start by dividing the first row by 2:\n\n[ 1  1.5 | 3.5 ]\n[ 4  6  | 14 ]\n\nNext, we will eliminate the 4 in the second row by subtracting 4 times the first row from the second row:\n\n[ 1  1.5 | 3.5 ]\n[ 0  0   | 0 ]\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n[ 1  1.5 | 3.5 ]\n[ 0  0   | 0 ]\n\nFrom the second row, we have 0x + 0y = 0, which is an identity and does not provide any information about x and y. The first row gives us x + 1.5y = 3.5. Since we don't have a unique solution for y, we can express the solution in terms of y:\n\nx = 3.5 - 1.5y\n\nThe system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, and they can be expressed as:\n\nx = 3.5 - 1.5y\ny = y\n\nwhere y can be any real number."
