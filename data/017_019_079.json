    "message_2": "To determine which non-abelian group of order 36 the given group is isomorphic to, we first need to analyze the structure of the group G.\n\n1. The order of G is 36, which has prime factorization 2^2 * 3^2.\n\n2. The group G is non-abelian, which means that the group operation is not commutative.\n\n3. The multiplication table provided shows that the group operation is closed and has an identity element e.\n\nNow, we know that there are two non-abelian groups of order 36 up to isomorphism: the dihedral group D_18 and the direct product of the symmetric group S_3 and the cyclic group C_6, denoted as S_3 × C_6.\n\nTo determine which group G is isomorphic to, we can look for properties that distinguish these two groups:\n\n1. D_18 has 18 elements of order 2, while S_3 × C_6 has 6 elements of order 2.\n\n2. D_18 has a cyclic subgroup of order 18, while S_3 × C_6 does not.\n\nLet's analyze the given multiplication table to see which properties hold for G:\n\n1. Elements of order 2: We can see that there are 6 elements of order 2 in G (b, d, h, o, r, and s). This matches the property of S_3 × C_6.\n\n2. Cyclic subgroup of order 18: There is no cyclic subgroup of order 18 in G, as no element generates a subgroup of order 18. This also matches the property of S_3 × C_6.\n\nBased on these properties, we can conclude that the given group G is isomorphic to the non-abelian group S_3 × C_6."
