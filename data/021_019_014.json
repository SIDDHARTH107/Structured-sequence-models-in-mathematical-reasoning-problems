    "message_2": "The Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. In this case, we will use it to find the minimum value of the given function f(x) = (x-2)^2 + 5 on the interval [0, 5]. Here's a step-by-step guide to applying the HS algorithm:\n\nStep 1: Initialize the parameters\n- Harmony Memory Size (HMS): The number of solution vectors in the harmony memory. Let's choose HMS = 10.\n- Harmony Memory Consideration Rate (HMCR): The probability of choosing a value from the harmony memory. Let's choose HMCR = 0.8.\n- Pitch Adjustment Rate (PAR): The probability of adjusting a value chosen from the harmony memory. Let's choose PAR = 0.3.\n- Number of iterations (NI): The number of times the algorithm will be repeated. Let's choose NI = 100.\n\nStep 2: Initialize the harmony memory\nGenerate 10 random solution vectors (harmonies) within the given interval [0, 5] and calculate their corresponding objective function values. Store these harmonies and their objective function values in the harmony memory.\n\nStep 3: Improvise a new harmony\nFor each decision variable (in this case, we only have x), do the following:\n- Generate a random number between 0 and 1. If this number is less than HMCR, select a value from the harmony memory for this variable. Otherwise, generate a random value within the given interval [0, 5].\n- If the value was selected from the harmony memory, generate another random number between 0 and 1. If this number is less than PAR, adjust the value by adding or subtracting a small random number (e.g., from a uniform distribution).\n\nStep 4: Update the harmony memory\nCalculate the objective function value of the new harmony. If this value is better (lower) than the worst value in the harmony memory, replace the worst harmony with the new harmony.\n\nStep 5: Repeat\nRepeat steps 3 and 4 for the specified number of iterations (NI = 100).\n\nStep 6: Find the best solution\nAfter completing the iterations, find the harmony with the lowest objective function value in the harmony memory. This harmony represents the approximate minimum value of the function.\n\nNote that the HS algorithm is a stochastic optimization method, so the results may vary between different runs. You can improve the accuracy of the solution by increasing the number of iterations or fine-tuning the algorithm's parameters."
