    "message_2": "To solve the given differential equation, we first find the characteristic equation:\n\n$r^2 + 5r + 6 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n$(r + 2)(r + 3) = 0$\n\nThe roots of the characteristic equation are $r_1 = -2$ and $r_2 = -3$. Since these roots are distinct, the general solution of the differential equation is given by:\n\n$y(x) = C_1 e^{-2x} + C_2 e^{-3x}$\n\nNow, we need to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ using the initial conditions.\n\nFor $y(0) = 1$, we have:\n\n$1 = C_1 e^{0} + C_2 e^{0}$\n\n$1 = C_1 + C_2$\n\nFor $y'(0) = -2$, we first find the derivative of $y(x)$:\n\n$y'(x) = -2C_1 e^{-2x} - 3C_2 e^{-3x}$\n\nNow, we plug in $x = 0$:\n\n$-2 = -2C_1 e^{0} - 3C_2 e^{0}$\n\n$-2 = -2C_1 - 3C_2$\n\nWe have a system of linear equations:\n\n$\n\\begin{cases}\nC_1 + C_2 = 1 \\\\\n-2C_1 - 3C_2 = -2\n\\end{cases}\n$\n\nWe can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 2 and adding the equations:\n\n$\n\\begin{cases}\n2C_1 + 2C_2 = 2 \\\\\n-2C_1 - 3C_2 = -2\n\\end{cases}\n$\n\nAdding the equations, we get:\n\n$-C_2 = 0$\n\nSo, $C_2 = 0$. Plugging this back into the first equation, we get $C_1 = 1$. Therefore, the particular solution is:\n\n$y(x) = e^{-2x}$\n\nFinally, we find the value of $y(2)$:\n\n$y(2) = e^{-2(2)} = e^{-4} \\approx 0.0183$\n\nSo, the value of $y(2)$ is approximately $0.0183$."
