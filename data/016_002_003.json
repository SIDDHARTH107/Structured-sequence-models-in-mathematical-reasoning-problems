    "message_2": "A Koch snowflake is a fractal that is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively adding smaller equilateral triangles to its sides. After each iteration, the length of each side of the snowflake increases by a factor of 4/3.\n\nAfter three iterations, the length of each side of the snowflake will be:\n\nInitial length * (4/3)^3 = 10 * (4/3)^3 = 10 * (64/27) = 640/27 cm\n\nSince the Koch snowflake is formed from an equilateral triangle, it has three sides. Therefore, the perimeter of the Koch snowflake after three iterations is:\n\nPerimeter = 3 * (length of one side) = 3 * (640/27) = 1920/27 cm â‰ˆ 71.11 cm"
