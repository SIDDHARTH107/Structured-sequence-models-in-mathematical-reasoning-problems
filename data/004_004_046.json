    "message_2": "To find the area enclosed between the x-axis, x = 2 and x = 5 by the curve y = 3x - 1, we will use the definite integral. The definite integral represents the signed area between the curve and the x-axis.\n\nThe area A can be found using the formula:\n\nA = ∫[a, b] (f(x) dx)\n\nwhere f(x) is the function y = 3x - 1, a = 2, and b = 5.\n\nA = ∫[2, 5] (3x - 1) dx\n\nTo find the integral, we will first find the antiderivative of the function (3x - 1).\n\nThe antiderivative of (3x - 1) is:\n\nF(x) = (3/2)x^2 - x + C\n\nNow, we will evaluate the definite integral:\n\nA = F(5) - F(2)\n\nA = [(3/2)(5)^2 - (5)] - [(3/2)(2)^2 - (2)]\n\nA = [(3/2)(25) - 5] - [(3/2)(4) - 2]\n\nA = [37.5 - 5] - [6 - 2]\n\nA = [32.5] - [4]\n\nA = 28.5\n\nThe area enclosed between the x-axis, x = 2 and x = 5 by the curve y = 3x - 1 is 28.5 square units."
