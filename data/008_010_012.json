    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination, we will perform a series of row operations to transform the augmented matrix into an upper triangular matrix, and then use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system of equations:\n\n|  3  2 -1 | 11\n|  2 -4  2 |-16\n| -1  1  5 | 2\n\nStep 1: Eliminate x from the second and third rows.\nWe will use the first row as the pivot row. To eliminate x from the second row, we will subtract (2/3) times the first row from the second row. To eliminate x from the third row, we will add the first row to the third row.\n\nNew augmented matrix:\n\n|  3   2  -1 |  11\n|  0  -8   4 | -24\n|  0   3   4 |  13\n\nStep 2: Eliminate y from the third row.\nNow, we will use the second row as the pivot row. To eliminate y from the third row, we will add (3/8) times the second row to the third row.\n\nNew augmented matrix:\n\n|  3   2  -1 |  11\n|  0  -8   4 | -24\n|  0   0   5 |   1\n\nNow we have an upper triangular matrix. We can use back-substitution to find the solution.\n\nStep 3: Back-substitution\nFrom the third row, we have 5z = 1, so z = 1/5.\nFrom the second row, -8y + 4z = -24, substituting the value of z, we get -8y + 4(1/5) = -24, so y = 3.\nFrom the first row, 3x + 2y - z = 11, substituting the values of y and z, we get 3x + 2(3) - (1/5) = 11, so x = 2.\n\nThe solution of the system is x = 2, y = 3, and z = 1/5."
