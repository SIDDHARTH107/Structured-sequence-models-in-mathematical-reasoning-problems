We will use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups in groups of order 96.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, we have p = 2 and n = 5. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted by n_2, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 (the index of 2 in the factorization of 96)\n2. n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)\n\nThe possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3. \n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, we have p = 3 and n = 1. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_3 divides 2^5 (the index of 3 in the factorization of 96)\n2. n_3 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\nThe possible values for n_3 are 1, 4, and 16.\n\nNow, we will use this information to determine whether a given group of order 96 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C96, the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, or one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96.\n\n1. If a group of order 96 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C96, it must have a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup (n_2 = n_3 = 1). This is because a cyclic group has a unique subgroup of each order dividing the group order.\n\n2. If a group of order 96 is isomorphic to the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, it must have 3 Sylow 2-subgroups and 4 Sylow 3-subgroups (n_2 = 3, n_3 = 4). This is because the direct product of groups has the same number of Sylow p-subgroups as the product of the numbers of Sylow p-subgroups of the factors.\n\n3. If a group of order 96 is one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96, it must have a different combination of numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups than the cyclic group and the alternating group. This could be (n_2 = 1, n_3 = 4), (n_2 = 1, n_3 = 16), (n_2 = 3, n_3 = 1), or (n_2 = 3, n_3 = 16).\n\nIn summary, to determine whether a given group of order 96 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C96, the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, or one of the 196 non-abelian groups of order 96, we need to find the numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups in the group and compare them to the possible values we found above."
