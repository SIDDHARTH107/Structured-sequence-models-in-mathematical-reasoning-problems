    "message_1": "A factory produces two types of products A and B. Each unit of product A requires 2 hours of processing time and 1 hour of assembly time, while Each unit of product B requires 1 hour of processing time and 3 hours of assembly time. The factory has 40 hours of processing time and 60 hours of assembly time available each week. The profit for each unit of product A is $10, and for each unit of product B is $15. Use simulated annealing to find the optimal number of units of each product the factory should produce to maximize its profit.",
    "message_2": "To use simulated annealing, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the objective function.\n2. Define the initial state and temperature.\n3. Define the cooling schedule.\n4. Generate a random neighbor solution.\n5. Calculate the change in the objective function.\n6. Accept or reject the new solution based on the change and temperature.\n7. Update the temperature and repeat steps 4-6 until the stopping condition is met.\n\nObjective function: Profit = 10 * A + 15 * B, subject to constraints 2A + B <= 40 (processing time) and A + 3B <= 60 (assembly time).\n\nInitial state: Start with A = 0 and B = 0 (no products produced).\n\nInitial temperature: Set an initial temperature, e.g., T = 100.\n\nCooling schedule: Decrease the temperature by a factor, e.g., alpha = 0.99, until a stopping condition is met, e.g., T < 0.001.\n\nNow we will perform the simulated annealing algorithm:\n\n1. Set the current solution to the initial state (A = 0, B = 0) and calculate the profit.\n2. Generate a random neighbor solution by changing the number of products A and B by a small random amount, ensuring that the constraints are still met.\n3. Calculate the change in profit between the current solution and the neighbor solution.\n4. If the change is positive (i.e., the neighbor solution has a higher profit), accept the neighbor solution as the new current solution. If the change is negative, accept the neighbor solution with a probability of exp(-change/T).\n5. Update the temperature by multiplying it with the cooling factor (T = T * alpha).\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the stopping condition is met (T < 0.001).\n\nAfter the algorithm is completed, the current solution should be an approximation of the optimal number of units of products A and B to maximize profit. Note that the simulated annealing algorithm is a heuristic method and may not always find the exact optimal solution, but it should provide a good approximation."
