    "message_2": "The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest integer R such that any graph of order R will contain either a clique of order m or an independent set of order n. In this case, we are looking for R(3,7).\n\nThe exact value of R(3,7) is not known. However, we can find the upper and lower bounds for R(3,7). \n\nThe general formula for the upper bound of Ramsey numbers is given by:\n\nR(m, n) ≤ R(m-1, n) + R(m, n-1)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the upper bound for R(3,7):\n\nR(3, 7) ≤ R(2, 7) + R(3, 6)\nR(2, 7) = 7 (since R(2, n) = n)\nR(3, 6) ≤ R(2, 6) + R(3, 5) = 6 + 9 = 15 (using the known values of R(3,5) and R(2,6))\n\nSo, R(3, 7) ≤ 7 + 15 = 22\n\nThe lower bound for R(3,7) can be calculated using the inequality:\n\nR(m, n) > (m-1)(n-1)\n\nR(3, 7) > (3-1)(7-1) = 2 × 6 = 12\n\nTherefore, the Ramsey number R(3,7) lies between 12 and 22, but its exact value is still an open question in mathematics."
