    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of the given equation:\n\nz = x^2 - 2y^2\n\n∂z/∂x = 2x\n∂z/∂y = -4y\n\nNow, let's find the tangent vectors at the point (1, 1, -1) on the surface:\n\nT_x = (1, 0, ∂z/∂x) = (1, 0, 2)\nT_y = (0, 1, ∂z/∂y) = (0, 1, -4)\n\nNext, we'll find the unit normal vector N:\n\nN = T_x × T_y = (8, 4, 1)\n\nNow, let's normalize N:\n\n|N| = √(8^2 + 4^2 + 1^2) = √(64 + 16 + 1) = √81 = 9\n\nN_normalized = (8/9, 4/9, 1/9)\n\nNow, let's compute the second partial derivatives of z:\n\n∂²z/∂x² = 2\n∂²z/∂y² = -8\n∂²z/∂x∂y = 0\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form matrix:\n\n[ L  M ]\n[ M  N ]\n\nwhere L = N • ∂²z/∂x², M = N • ∂²z/∂x∂y, and N = N • ∂²z/∂y²:\n\n[ 2(8/9)  0 ]\n[  0   -8(4/9) ]\n\n[ 16/9  0 ]\n[  0  -32/9 ]\n\nNow, we'll find the eigenvalues of this matrix, which represent the principal curvatures k1 and k2:\n\nThe determinant of the matrix minus lambda times the identity matrix is:\n\n| (16/9 - λ)  0      |\n|  0      (-32/9 - λ)|\n\n(16/9 - λ)((-32/9) - λ) = 0\n\nλ^2 - (16/9 - 32/9)λ = 0\nλ^2 - 16/9λ + 32/9λ = 0\nλ^2 + 16/9λ = 0\n\nλ(λ + 16/9) = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvalues (principal curvatures) are:\n\nk1 = 0\nk2 = -16/9\n\nNow, we'll find the eigenvectors (principal directions) corresponding to these eigenvalues:\n\nFor k1 = 0:\n\n(16/9 - 0)u + 0*v = 0\n0*u + (-32/9 - 0)v = 0\n\nu = 0, v = 1\n\nSo, the principal direction corresponding to k1 = 0 is (0, 1).\n\nFor k2 = -16/9:\n\n(16/9 - (-16/9))u + 0*v = 0\n0*u + (-32/9 - (-16/9))v = 0\n\nu = 1, v = 0\n\nSo, the principal direction corresponding to k2 = -16/9 is (1, 0).\n\nIn conclusion, the principal curvatures at the point (1, 1, -1) on the surface are k1 = 0 and k2 = -16/9, and their corresponding principal directions are (0, 1) and (1, 0), respectively."
