    "message_2": "To find the area between the curves y = x² and y = 2x - 3 in the interval [0, 3], we first need to find the points of intersection between the two curves. We can do this by setting y = x² equal to y = 2x - 3 and solving for x:\n\nx² = 2x - 3\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\nx² - 2x + 3 = 0\n\nNow we need to solve this quadratic equation for x. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (2 ± √((-2)² - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1)\nx = (2 ± √(4 - 12)) / 2\nx = (2 ± √(-8)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b² - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. This means that the two curves do not intersect in the interval [0, 3]. In this case, we can find the area between the curves by integrating the difference between the two functions over the interval [0, 3]:\n\nArea = ∫(2x - 3 - x²) dx from 0 to 3\n\nNow, we can find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\nAntiderivative = x² - (1/3)x³ + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of the interval and subtract the lower bound value from the upper bound value:\n\nArea = (3² - (1/3)(3³)) - (0² - (1/3)(0³))\nArea = (9 - 9) - (0 - 0)\nArea = 0\n\nThe area between the curves y = x² and y = 2x - 3 in the interval [0, 3] is 0."
