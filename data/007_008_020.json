    "message_2": "To find the remainder when 7^77 is divided by 11, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. First, let's find the pattern of remainders when powers of 7 are divided by 11.\n\n7^1 % 11 = 7\n7^2 % 11 = 5\n7^3 % 11 = 2\n7^4 % 11 = 3\n7^5 % 11 = 10\n7^6 % 11 = 4\n7^7 % 11 = 6\n7^8 % 11 = 9\n7^9 % 11 = 8\n7^10 % 11 = 1\n\nNotice that after the 10th power, the remainder becomes 1, which means the pattern will repeat after every 10 powers. Since 77 is 7 more than a multiple of 10 (70), we can find the remainder of 7^77 by finding the remainder of 7^7:\n\n7^7 % 11 = 6\n\nSo, the remainder when 7^77 is divided by 11 is 6."
