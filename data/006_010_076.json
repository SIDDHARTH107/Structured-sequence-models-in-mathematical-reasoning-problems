    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, individuals affected by the disease) in n trials (the sample size)\n- n choose k is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, being affected by the disease)\n- k is the number of successes\n- n is the number of trials (sample size)\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 500 (sample size)\n- k = 60 (number of individuals affected by the disease)\n- p = 0.12 (probability of being affected by the disease)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 60) = (500 choose 60) * 0.12^60 * (1-0.12)^(500-60)\n\nFirst, we calculate the combinations (500 choose 60):\n\n(500 choose 60) = 500! / (60!(500-60)!) = 500! / (60!440!)\n\nNext, we calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 60) = (500 choose 60) * 0.12^60 * 0.88^440\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 60) â‰ˆ 0.0394\n\nSo, the probability that a random sample of 500 people from the demographic group has exactly 60 individuals affected by the disease is approximately 0.0394 or 3.94%."
