There are 5 distribution centers (nodes) and 8 retail stores (nodes) connected through 10 links. The transportation cost (in dollars) for each link is given below:\n\nLink 1: DC1-RS1 = 100, DC1-RS3 = 120 \n\nLink 2: DC2-RS1 = 110, DC2-RS2 = 100\n\nLink 3: DC3-RS3 = 90, DC3-RS4 = 120 \n\nLink 4: DC4-RS1 = 150, DC4-RS2 = 180 \n\nLink 5: DC4-RS5 = 120, DC4-RS6 = 110 \n\nLink 6: DC5-RS8 = 150, DC5-RS7 = 120 \n\nLink 7: DC5-RS6 = 100, DC5-RS7 = 130 \n\nLink 8: RS1-RS2 = 70, RS1-RS3 = 60\n\nLink 9: RS3-RS4 = 90, RS3-RS5 = 80 \n\nLink 10: RS5-RS6 = 50, RS6-RS7 = 70, RS7-RS8 = 60 \n\nIf the company needs to transport a total of 800 units of goods from warehouse to different stores, what is the optimal path through the network that minimizes the transportation cost? Use network optimization techniques to solve the problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from each distribution center to each retail store.
