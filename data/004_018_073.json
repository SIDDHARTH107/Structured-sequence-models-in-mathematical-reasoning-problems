    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^3 - 2x^2 + 9x - 7 using the power rule, we will differentiate each term with respect to x.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. Derivative of 5x^3: (3)(5)x^(3-1) = 15x^2\n2. Derivative of -2x^2: (2)(-2)x^(2-1) = -4x\n3. Derivative of 9x: (1)(9)x^(1-1) = 9\n4. Derivative of -7 (constant): 0\n\nNow, combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 15x^2 - 4x + 9\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^3 - 2x^2 + 9x - 7 is f'(x) = 15x^2 - 4x + 9."
