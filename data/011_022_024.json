    "message_1": "A student has to pack their backpack with the maximum weight capacity of 7 kilograms. The student wants to carry as many textbooks as possible, each weighing 1 kilogram. However, there are a total of 5 textbooks available, and the student can only choose some of them due to the limited capacity of the backpack. What is the maximum number of textbooks that the student can carry in their backpack?",
    "message_2": "The maximum number of textbooks the student can carry in their backpack is 5, as long as the total weight does not exceed the backpack's capacity of 7 kilograms. Since each textbook weighs 1 kilogram, carrying all 5 textbooks would result in a total weight of 5 kilograms, which is within the backpack's capacity."
