    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a tornado occurring in a specific county in Kansas during the month of May, we can use the historical data provided. \n\nIn the last 50 years, there have been 10 tornadoes in that county during the month of May. Therefore, we can calculate the average number of tornadoes per year in May as follows:\n\nTotal number of tornadoes in May = 10\nTotal number of years = 50\n\nAverage number of tornadoes per year in May = (Total number of tornadoes in May) / (Total number of years)\n= 10 / 50\n= 0.2 tornadoes per year in May\n\nSince there are 31 days in May, the probability of a tornado occurring on any given day in May can be calculated as:\n\nAverage number of tornadoes per day in May = (Average number of tornadoes per year in May) / (Number of days in May)\n= 0.2 / 31\n= 0.00645 (rounded to 5 decimal places)\n\nSo, the probability of a tornado occurring in a specific county in Kansas during the month of May is approximately 0.00645 or 0.645% per day."
