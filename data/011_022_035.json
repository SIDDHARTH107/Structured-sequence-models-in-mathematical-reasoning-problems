You have spotted 5 items of interest, each with its own value and weight.\n\nItem 1: Value= $50, Weight= 10 pounds\nItem 2: Value= $70, Weight= 12 pounds\nItem 3: Value= $30, Weight= 5 pounds\nItem 4: Value= $40, Weight= 7 pounds\nItem 5: Value= $60, Weight= 15 pounds\n\nYou can select any combination of items, but the total weight of the items you choose cannot exceed the capacity of your knapsack. What is the maximum value of items that you can steal?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of items that can be stolen, we need to consider the value-to-weight ratio of each item and try different combinations without exceeding the knapsack's capacity.\n\nValue-to-weight ratios:\nItem 1: 50/10 = 5\nItem 2: 70/12 ≈ 5.83\nItem 3: 30/5 = 6\nItem 4: 40/7 ≈ 5.71\nItem 5: 60/15 = 4\n\nWe can start by trying combinations with the highest value-to-weight ratios:\n\n1. Item 3 and Item 4: Total value = $30 + $40 = $70, Total weight = 5 + 7 = 12 pounds\n2. Item 2 and Item 3: Total value = $70 + $30 = $100, Total weight = 12 + 5 = 17 pounds\n3. Item 1 and Item 3: Total value = $50 + $30 = $80, Total weight = 10 + 5 = 15 pounds\n4. Item 1 and Item 4: Total value = $50 + $40 = $90, Total weight = 10 + 7 = 17 pounds\n\nThe combination of Item 2 and Item 3 gives the maximum value of $100 without exceeding the knapsack's capacity of 20 pounds."
