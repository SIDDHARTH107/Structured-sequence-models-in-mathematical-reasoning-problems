    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * s^2) / 2\n\nwhere s is the side length of the hexagon.\n\nIn this case, s = 6 inches. Plugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (3 * √3 * 6^2) / 2\nArea = (3 * √3 * 36) / 2\nArea = (108 * √3) / 2\nArea = 54 * √3\n\nTherefore, the area of the regular hexagon with a side length of 6 inches is 54√3 square inches."
