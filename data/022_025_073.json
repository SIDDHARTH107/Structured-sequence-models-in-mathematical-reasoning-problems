However, this is a complex-valued potential problem, which is not analytically solvable in general. Therefore, we cannot find explicit expressions for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $E$ in this case.\n\nIn practice, one would need to use numerical methods or approximations to find the energy levels and wave functions for this complex-valued potential problem."
