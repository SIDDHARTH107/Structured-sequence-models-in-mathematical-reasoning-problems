    "message_2": "If player A uses \"Strategy P\", we can look at the payoffs for player B in the row corresponding to \"Strategy P\":\n\n|     | Strategy X | Strategy Y | Strategy Z |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Strategy P** | 0 | -3 | -4 |\n\nPlayer B wants to minimize their loss (or maximize their gain), so they should choose the strategy with the highest value in this row. In this case, that would be \"Strategy X\" with a payoff of 0.\n\nSo, the best strategy for player B is \"Strategy X\". The expected payoff for player A is 0 (from Strategy P and Strategy X), and since it's a zero-sum game, the expected payoff for player B is also 0."
