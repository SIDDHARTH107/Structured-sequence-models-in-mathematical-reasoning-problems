Define h : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → X by h(s, t) = f((1−t)s) + g(t(s−1)). Show that h is a homotopy between f and g. Calculate [f] and [g] in the fundamental group π1(X, x0) (where x0 is any common point in the images of f and g) and prove that [f] = [g].",
    "message_2": "To show that h is a homotopy between f and g, we need to show that h is continuous and that h(s, 0) = f(s) and h(s, 1) = g(s) for all s in [0, 1].\n\nFirst, let's check the boundary conditions:\n\nh(s, 0) = f((1-0)s) + g(0(s-1)) = f(s) + g(0) = f(s) since g(0) = f(0) = x0.\n\nh(s, 1) = f((1-1)s) + g(1(s-1)) = f(0) + g(s-1) = g(s) since f(0) = g(0) = x0.\n\nNow, we need to show that h is continuous. Since f and g are continuous maps, the sum of two continuous maps is also continuous. The functions (1-t)s and t(s-1) are continuous functions of s and t, so their compositions with f and g are also continuous. Therefore, h(s, t) = f((1−t)s) + g(t(s−1)) is continuous.\n\nNow, let's calculate [f] and [g] in the fundamental group π1(X, x0). Recall that the fundamental group is defined as the set of homotopy classes of loops based at x0, with the group operation being concatenation of loops.\n\nSince h is a homotopy between f and g, we have that [f] = [g] in π1(X, x0). This means that the homotopy classes of f and g are equal in the fundamental group, and thus, they represent the same element in the group."
