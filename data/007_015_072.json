    "message_2": "A Mersenne prime is a prime number that can be written in the form M_n = 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. To find the 19th Mersenne prime, we need to find the 19th prime number n for which M_n is also prime.\n\nThe first 19 Mersenne prime exponents (n values) are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281, 3217, and 4253.\n\nSo, the 19th Mersenne prime exponent is 4253. Now, we can calculate the Mersenne prime itself:\n\nM_4253 = 2^4253 - 1\n\nThis number is too large to display here, as it has 1,281 digits. However, you can use software like Mathematica or online tools to calculate it if needed."
