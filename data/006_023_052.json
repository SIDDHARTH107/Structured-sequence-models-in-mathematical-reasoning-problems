    "message_1": "A market research study suggests that the probability of a customer buying a product is 0.6 when the product is placed at the eye level. If a store has 100 units of the product, what is the probability that at least 60 units will be sold if they are placed at the eye level?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, selling k units)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n! / (k!(n-k)!))\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.6)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 100 units)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, at least 60 units sold)\n\nSince we want to find the probability of selling at least 60 units, we need to calculate the sum of probabilities for k = 60, 61, 62, ..., 100.\n\nP(X ≥ 60) = Σ P(X = k) for k = 60 to 100\n\nCalculating this sum can be tedious, so we can use a cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the probability of selling 59 or fewer units and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of selling at least 60 units.\n\nP(X ≥ 60) = 1 - P(X ≤ 59)\n\nUsing a binomial CDF calculator or statistical software, we can find:\n\nP(X ≤ 59) ≈ 0.0574\n\nTherefore, the probability of selling at least 60 units is:\n\nP(X ≥ 60) = 1 - 0.0574 ≈ 0.9426\n\nSo, there is approximately a 94.26% chance that at least 60 units will be sold if they are placed at the eye level."
