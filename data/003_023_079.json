    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can use the formula:\n\nA x B = |A| |B| sin(θ) n\n\nwhere |A| and |B| are the magnitudes of vectors A and B, θ is the angle between the two vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitudes of vectors A and B:\n\n|A| = √(3^2 + 4^2 + (-2)^2) = √(9 + 16 + 4) = √29\n|B| = √(5^2 + (-2)^2 + 6^2) = √(25 + 4 + 36) = √65\n\nNext, we need to find the angle θ between the two vectors. We can use the dot product formula to do this:\n\nA · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)\n\nA · B = (3 * 5) + (4 * -2) + (-2 * 6) = 15 - 8 - 12 = -5\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(θ):\n\ncos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|) = -5 / (√29 * √65)\n\nNow, we can find sin(θ) using the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1\nsin^2(θ) = 1 - cos^2(θ)\nsin(θ) = √(1 - (-5 / (√29 * √65))^2)\n\nFinally, we can find the cross product A x B:\n\nA x B = |A| |B| sin(θ) n\n\nWe already have |A|, |B|, and sin(θ). To find the unit vector n, we can use the right-hand rule. The right-hand rule states that if you curl the fingers of your right hand from vector A to vector B, your thumb will point in the direction of the unit vector n. In this case, n = [i, j, k].\n\nNow, we can compute the cross product:\n\nA x B = (√29 * √65 * √(1 - (-5 / (√29 * √65))^2)) [i, j, k]\n\nHowever, this method is not the most efficient way to find the cross product. Instead, we can use the determinant method:\n\nA x B = [(4 * 6 - (-2) * (-2))i - (3 * 6 - (-2) * 5)j + (3 * (-2) - 4 * 5)k] = [20i - 8j - 26k]\n\nSo, the cross product of vectors A and B is [20, -8, -26]."
