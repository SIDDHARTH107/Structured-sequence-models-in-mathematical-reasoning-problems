    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parametrize the surface as follows:\nr(u,v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form:\nru = (1, 0, 2u)\nrv = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nI = |<ru, ru>  <ru, rv>|\n      |<rv, ru>  <rv, rv>|\n\nI = |1+4u^2  4uv|\n      |4uv      1+4v^2|\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form:\nruu = (0, 0, 2)\nruv = (0, 0, 2)\nrvv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\nII = |<ruu, N>  <ruv, N>|\n       |<ruv, N>  <rvv, N>|\n\nWe need to find the normal vector N. We can compute it as the cross product of ru and rv:\nN = ru Ã— rv = (2u, 2v, -1)\n\nNow, we compute the dot products for the second fundamental form:\n<ruu, N> = 2*(-1) = -2\n<ruv, N> = 2*(-1) = -2\n<rvv, N> = 2*(-1) = -2\n\nSo, the second fundamental form is:\nII = |-2 -2|\n       |-2 -2|\n\nNow, we find the principal curvatures by finding the eigenvalues of the matrix (I^(-1) * II). First, we compute the inverse of the first fundamental form:\nI^(-1) = (1/(1+16u^2+16v^2-16u^2v^2)) * |1+4v^2  -4uv|\n                                                      |-4uv      1+4u^2|\n\nAt the point of interest (1,1,0), we have u=1 and v=1:\nI^(-1) = (1/9) * |5 -4|\n                    |-4  5|\n\nNow, we compute the product I^(-1) * II:\nI^(-1) * II = (1/9) * |-2|\n                              |-2|\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are the principal curvatures. In this case, the matrix is already diagonal, so the principal curvatures are simply the diagonal elements:\n\nk1 = -2/9\nk2 = -2/9\n\nSo, the principal curvatures at the point (1,1,0) on the surface with equation f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2 are -2/9 and -2/9."
