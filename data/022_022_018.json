    "message_2": "The Fourier transform of a complex function f(z) is typically defined for functions of a real variable, not for functions of a complex variable like the one you provided. However, if you meant the function f(t) = e^(it^2 - 3t + 5) with t being a real variable, then we can find its Fourier transform.\n\nThe Fourier transform F(ω) of a function f(t) is given by the following integral:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[f(t) * e^(-iωt)] dt, where the integral is taken over all real numbers.\n\nFor the given function f(t) = e^(it^2 - 3t + 5), we have:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(it^2 - 3t + 5) * e^(-iωt)] dt\n\nNow, combine the exponentials:\n\nF(ω) = ∫[e^(it^2 - (3 + ω)i*t + 5)] dt\n\nThis integral does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, it can be expressed in terms of special functions or approximated numerically for specific values of ω."
