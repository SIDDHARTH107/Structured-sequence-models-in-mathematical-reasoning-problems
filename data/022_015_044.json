    "message_2": "To apply the Schwarz reflection principle, we first define a function F(z) that is analytic in the lower half-plane Im(z) < 0 and continuous on the real line R. We define F(z) as follows:\n\nF(z) = f(∗z)∗, where ∗ denotes complex conjugation.\n\nNow, we can define a new function G(z) that is analytic in the entire complex plane, except possibly on the real line R:\n\nG(z) = { f(z), if Im(z) ≥ 0\n         F(z), if Im(z) < 0\n\nWe know that G(z) is continuous on the real line R since f(z) and F(z) are continuous on R and f(x) = F(x) = g(x) for x ∈ R. Now, we want to show that G(z) is also analytic on the real line R.\n\nLet z = x + iy with x ∈ R and y > 0. Then, we have:\n\nG'(z) = lim_{y→0^+} (G(z + iy) - G(z)) / iy\n      = lim_{y→0^+} (f(x + i(y+y)) - f(x + iy)) / iy\n\nNow, using the given condition lim_{y→0^+} f(x+iy) = h(x), we have:\n\nG'(z) = lim_{y→0^+} (h(x) - f(x + iy)) / iy\n\nSince h(x) is a real-valued function, we can rewrite the above expression as:\n\nG'(z) = lim_{y→0^+} (h(x) - g(x)) / iy\n\nNow, we know that G'(z) exists since h(x) and g(x) are real-valued functions of a real variable, and the limit exists. Therefore, G(z) is analytic on the real line R.\n\nSince G(z) is analytic in the entire complex plane, except possibly on the real line R, and continuous on R, we can apply the Schwarz reflection principle to obtain an explicit formula for f(z) in terms of g(x), h(x), and M:\n\nf(z) = G(z) = (1/2) [g(z) + h(z)] + (1/2) [g(z) - h(z)](z/M)^2\n\nThis is the explicit formula for f(z) in terms of g(x), h(x), and M."
