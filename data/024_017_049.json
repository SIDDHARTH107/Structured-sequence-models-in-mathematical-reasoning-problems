    "message_2": "To find the parallel transport of the vector $\\vec{V}$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)$, we need to ensure that the transported vector remains parallel to the original vector at each point on the curve. We can achieve this by keeping the derivative of the transported vector with respect to the curve parameter $t$ orthogonal to the tangent vector of the curve.\n\nFirst, let's find the tangent vector of the curve $\\gamma(t)$. The tangent vector is given by the derivative of the curve with respect to $t$:\n\n$\\frac{d\\gamma(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d(t, t^2)}{dt} = (1, 2t)$.\n\nNow, let the transported vector be $\\vec{V}(t) = (a(t), b(t))$. We want the derivative of $\\vec{V}(t)$ with respect to $t$ to be orthogonal to the tangent vector $(1, 2t)$. This means that their dot product should be zero:\n\n$\\frac{d\\vec{V}(t)}{dt} \\cdot (1, 2t) = 0$.\n\nTaking the derivative of $\\vec{V}(t)$ with respect to $t$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{d\\vec{V}(t)}{dt} = (\\frac{da(t)}{dt}, \\frac{db(t)}{dt})$.\n\nNow, we can write the dot product equation:\n\n$(\\frac{da(t)}{dt}, \\frac{db(t)}{dt}) \\cdot (1, 2t) = \\frac{da(t)}{dt} + 2t\\frac{db(t)}{dt} = 0$.\n\nWe also know that at $t=0$, the transported vector $\\vec{V}(0) = (3, 4)$. To solve the above differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. Let's multiply both sides of the equation by $e^{\\int 2t dt} = e^{t^2}$:\n\n$e^{t^2}\\frac{da(t)}{dt} + 2te^{t^2}\\frac{db(t)}{dt} = 0$.\n\nNow, we can notice that the left-hand side is the derivative of the product $e^{t^2}a(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{t^2}a(t)) = e^{t^2}\\frac{da(t)}{dt} + 2te^{t^2}\\frac{db(t)}{dt}$.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{t^2}a(t)) = 0$.\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$, we get:\n\n$e^{t^2}a(t) = C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we can find the constant $C$ using the initial condition $a(0) = 3$:\n\n$e^{0^2}a(0) = C \\Rightarrow C = 3$.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{3}{e^{t^2}}$.\n\nNow, we can find $b(t)$ by integrating the equation:\n\n$\\frac{da(t)}{dt} + 2t\\frac{db(t)}{dt} = 0$.\n\nDifferentiating $a(t)$ with respect to $t$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{da(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{6t}{e^{t^2}}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n$-\\frac{6t}{e^{t^2}} + 2t\\frac{db(t)}{dt} = 0$.\n\nDividing both sides by $2t$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{db(t)}{dt} = \\frac{3}{e^{t^2}}$.\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$, we get:\n\n$b(t) = 3\\int \\frac{1}{e^{t^2}} dt + D$,\n\nwhere $D$ is another constant of integration. Unfortunately, this integral does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, we can express it in terms of the error function, which is defined as:\n\n$\\text{erf}(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^x e^{-t^2} dt$.\n\nUsing the error function, we can write:\n\n$b(t) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\\text{erf}(t) + D$.\n\nNow, we can find the constant $D$ using the initial condition $b(0) = 4$:\n\n$4 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\\text{erf}(0) + D \\Rightarrow D = 4$.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$b(t) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\\text{erf}(t) + 4$.\n\nFinally, the parallel transport of the vector $\\vec{V}$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)$ is given by:\n\n$\\vec{V}(t) = (a(t), b(t)) = \\left(\\frac{3}{e^{t^2}}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\\text{erf}(t) + 4\\right)$."
