    "message_1": "A student is studying a sine function with a phase shift of 30 degrees. The equation for the function is y = 4 sin(4x - 30). What is the phase shift of the sine function when it is graphed?",
    "message_2": "The phase shift of the sine function can be found by looking at the argument inside the sine function. In this case, the argument is (4x - 30). To find the phase shift, we need to set the argument equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n4x - 30 = 0\n\nNow, add 30 to both sides:\n\n4x = 30\n\nNext, divide by 4:\n\nx = 30/4\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nx = 15/2\n\nSo, the phase shift of the sine function when it is graphed is 15/2 or 7.5 degrees."
