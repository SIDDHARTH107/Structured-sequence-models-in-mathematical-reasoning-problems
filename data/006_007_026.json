    "message_2": "To find the expected change in the stock price, we can use the formula for expected value:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of Outcome 1 × Value of Outcome 1) + (Probability of Outcome 2 × Value of Outcome 2)\n\nIn this case, Outcome 1 is the stock increasing in price by $5, and Outcome 2 is the stock decreasing in price by $10.\n\nExpected Value = (0.60 × $5) + (0.40 × -$10)\n\nExpected Value = ($3) + (-$4)\n\nExpected Value = -$1\n\nThe expected change in the stock price is a decrease of $1."
