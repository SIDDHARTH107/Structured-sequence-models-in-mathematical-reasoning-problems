    "message_2": "To find the subgroups of G, we can use the fact that the order of a subgroup H divides the order of G (Lagrange's theorem). Since the order of G is 12, the possible orders of its subgroups are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\n1. The trivial subgroup {e} with order 1 is always a subgroup and is cyclic.\n\n2. Subgroups of order 2: These subgroups will have elements of order 2. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/2) will have order 2, where n is the order of the group. So, g^6 has order 2. The subgroup generated by g^6 is {e, g^6} and is cyclic.\n\n3. Subgroups of order 3: These subgroups will have elements of order 3. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/3) will have order 3, where n is the order of the group. So, g^4 has order 3. The subgroup generated by g^4 is {e, g^4, g^8} and is cyclic.\n\n4. Subgroups of order 4: These subgroups will have elements of order 4. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/4) will have order 4, where n is the order of the group. So, g^3 has order 4. The subgroup generated by g^3 is {e, g^3, g^6, g^9} and is cyclic.\n\n5. Subgroups of order 6: These subgroups will have elements of order 6. In a cyclic group, the element g^(n/6) will have order 6, where n is the order of the group. So, g^2 has order 6. The subgroup generated by g^2 is {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10} and is cyclic.\n\n6. The whole group G itself is a subgroup of order 12 and is cyclic since it is generated by g.\n\nIn summary, the subgroups of G are:\n1. {e}\n2. {e, g^6}\n3. {e, g^4, g^8}\n4. {e, g^3, g^6, g^9}\n5. {e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8, g^10}\n6. G = {e, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5, g^6, g^7, g^8, g^9, g^10, g^11}\n\nAll of these subgroups are cyclic since they are generated by a single element."
