    "message_2": "We are given the higher-order logic statement:\n\n∀P ∈ (ℕ → Prop), (∃a,b ∈ ℕ, P(a) ∧ P(b)) ⟹ (∃n ∈ ℕ, P(n)).\n\nThis statement says that for any property P defined on natural numbers, if there exist two numbers a and b such that P(a) and P(b), then there exists a natural number n such that P(n).\n\nTo prove this, let's consider an arbitrary property P defined on natural numbers. By the given statement, we know that if there exist two numbers a and b such that P(a) and P(b), then there exists a natural number n such that P(n).\n\nNow, let's assume that there exist two numbers a and b such that P(a) and P(b). By the given statement, this implies that there exists a natural number n such that P(n).\n\nThus, we have shown that for any property P defined on natural numbers, if there exist two numbers a and b such that P(a) and P(b), then there exists a natural number n such that P(n)."
