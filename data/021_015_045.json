    "message_1": "The problem is to maximize the function `f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4` using particle swarm optimization with the initial swarm of particles `x0 = {2, 3, 1, 4, 5}`.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using particle swarm optimization (PSO), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the particles' positions and velocities.\n2. Calculate the fitness of each particle.\n3. Update the personal best and global best positions.\n4. Update the particles' velocities and positions.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nLet's start by initializing the particles' positions and velocities:\n\nx0 = {2, 3, 1, 4, 5}\nv0 = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0} (initial velocities are set to 0)\n\nNow, let's calculate the fitness of each particle using the function f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 4:\n\nf(2) = 2\nf(3) = 4\nf(1) = 2\nf(4) = 8\nf(5) = 14\n\nThe personal best positions (pBest) are initialized to the initial positions:\n\npBest = {2, 3, 1, 4, 5}\n\nThe global best position (gBest) is the position with the highest fitness:\n\ngBest = 5 (with a fitness of 14)\n\nNow, let's update the particles' velocities and positions. We'll use the standard PSO parameters: w (inertia weight) = 0.7, c1 (cognitive component) = 2, and c2 (social component) = 2.\n\nFor each particle i, the velocity update formula is:\n\nvi(t+1) = w * vi(t) + c1 * rand() * (pBesti - xi(t)) + c2 * rand() * (gBest - xi(t))\n\nAnd the position update formula is:\n\nxi(t+1) = xi(t) + vi(t+1)\n\nLet's perform one iteration:\n\nv1 = {0.7 * 0 + 2 * rand() * (2 - 2) + 2 * rand() * (5 - 2),\n      0.7 * 0 + 2 * rand() * (3 - 3) + 2 * rand() * (5 - 3),\n      0.7 * 0 + 2 * rand() * (1 - 1) + 2 * rand() * (5 - 1),\n      0.7 * 0 + 2 * rand() * (4 - 4) + 2 * rand() * (5 - 4),\n      0.7 * 0 + 2 * rand() * (5 - 5) + 2 * rand() * (5 - 5)}\n\nx1 = {2 + v1[0], 3 + v1[1], 1 + v1[2], 4 + v1[3], 5 + v1[4]}\n\nWe would continue iterating, updating the velocities and positions, and checking for new personal best and global best positions until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations).\n\nIn this specific problem, since the function is a simple quadratic function, we can find the maximum analytically by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 3 = 0\nx = 3/2 = 1.5\n\nHowever, the PSO algorithm is more useful for complex functions where an analytical solution is not easily obtainable."
