    "message_2": "To find the principal curvatures, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. Let the surface be parametrized by the function F(u, v) = (u, v, uv + u).\n\n1. Compute the first fundamental form:\n\nThe tangent vectors are given by the partial derivatives of F with respect to u and v:\n\nFu = (1, 0, v + 1)\nFv = (0, 1, u)\n\nThe first fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nI = [ <Fu, Fu>  <Fu, Fv> ]\n      [ <Fv, Fu>  <Fv, Fv> ]\n\nI = [ (1 + (v + 1)^2)  u ]\n      [ u  (1 + u^2) ]\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have:\n\nI = [ 5  1 ]\n      [ 1  2 ]\n\n2. Compute the second fundamental form:\n\nThe second derivatives of F are:\n\nFuu = (0, 0, 0)\nFuv = (0, 0, 1)\nFvv = (0, 0, 0)\n\nThe second fundamental form is given by the matrix:\n\nII = [ <Fuu, N>  <Fuv, N> ]\n        [ <Fuv, N>  <Fvv, N> ]\n\nwhere N is the unit normal vector to the surface. To find N, we first compute the cross product of Fu and Fv:\n\nN = Fu x Fv = (v + 1, -u, -u)\n\nNow, we normalize N:\n\n|N| = sqrt((v + 1)^2 + u^2 + u^2) = sqrt(u^2 + v^2 + 2uv + 2v)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have |N| = sqrt(6), so the unit normal vector is:\n\nN = (1/sqrt(6), -1/sqrt(6), -1/sqrt(6))\n\nNow, we can compute the second fundamental form:\n\nII = [ 0  <Fuv, N> ]\n        [ <Fuv, N>  0 ]\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have:\n\n<Fuv, N> = 1/sqrt(6)\n\nSo, II = [ 0  1/sqrt(6) ]\n              [ 1/sqrt(6)  0 ]\n\n3. Compute the principal curvatures:\n\nThe principal curvatures k1 and k2 are the eigenvalues of the matrix product (I^(-1) * II). First, we find the inverse of I:\n\nI^(-1) = (1/3) * [ 2  -1 ]\n                      [ -1  5 ]\n\nNow, we compute the matrix product:\n\nI^(-1) * II = (1/3) * [ 2  -1 ] * [ 0  1/sqrt(6) ]\n                              [ -1  5 ]   [ 1/sqrt(6)  0 ]\n\nI^(-1) * II = [ -1/sqrt(6)  1/sqrt(6) ]\n                      [ 1/sqrt(6)  5/sqrt(6) ]\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix are the principal curvatures:\n\nk1 = 3/sqrt(6)\nk2 = -1/sqrt(6)\n\nSo, the principal curvatures of the surface at the point (1, 1, 2) are 3/sqrt(6) and -1/sqrt(6)."
