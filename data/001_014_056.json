    "message_2": "To simplify the radical expression $\\sqrt{72}$, we need to find the prime factorization of 72 and then pair up any factors that appear twice.\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2$. We can rewrite the expression as follows:\n\n$\\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{2^3 \\cdot 3^2}$\n\nNow, we can pair up the factors:\n\n$\\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{(2^2 \\cdot 3^2) \\cdot 2}$\n\nSince the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can simplify further:\n\n$\\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}$\n\nFinally, we can take the square root of the perfect squares:\n\n$\\sqrt{72} = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}$\n\nSo, the simplified radical expression is:\n\n$\\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}$"
