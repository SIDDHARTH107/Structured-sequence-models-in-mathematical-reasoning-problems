    "message_1": "A fluid flows through a pipe of diameter 0.1 m with a velocity of 10 m/s. The fluid has a viscosity of 0.002 Pa s and a density of 1000 kg/m³. Determine the pressure drop per unit length of the pipe assuming it is a fully developed laminar flow.",
    "message_2": "To determine the pressure drop per unit length of the pipe, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for fully developed laminar flow in a circular pipe:\n\nΔP/L = (128 * μ * Q) / (π * D^4)\n\nwhere ΔP is the pressure drop, L is the length of the pipe, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, Q is the volumetric flow rate, and D is the diameter of the pipe.\n\nFirst, we need to find the volumetric flow rate (Q). We can use the formula:\n\nQ = A * v\n\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe and v is the velocity of the fluid.\n\nThe cross-sectional area of the pipe can be calculated using the formula:\n\nA = (π * D^2) / 4\n\nSubstituting the given diameter (D = 0.1 m):\n\nA = (π * (0.1)^2) / 4\nA ≈ 0.007854 m²\n\nNow, we can find the volumetric flow rate (Q) using the given velocity (v = 10 m/s):\n\nQ = A * v\nQ = 0.007854 m² * 10 m/s\nQ ≈ 0.07854 m³/s\n\nNow we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to find the pressure drop per unit length (ΔP/L):\n\nΔP/L = (128 * μ * Q) / (π * D^4)\n\nSubstituting the given values for viscosity (μ = 0.002 Pa s), volumetric flow rate (Q ≈ 0.07854 m³/s), and diameter (D = 0.1 m):\n\nΔP/L = (128 * 0.002 Pa s * 0.07854 m³/s) / (π * (0.1 m)^4)\nΔP/L ≈ (0.020224) / (π * 0.000001)\nΔP/L ≈ 6446.4 Pa/m\n\nTherefore, the pressure drop per unit length of the pipe is approximately 6446.4 Pa/m."
