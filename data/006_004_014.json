    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting at least two heads, we can first find the probabilities of getting exactly two heads and exactly three heads, and then add them together.\n\nThere are 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes when tossing a fair coin three times (HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT).\n\n1. Probability of getting exactly two heads:\nThere are 3 ways to get exactly two heads (HHT, HTH, THH).\nSo, the probability of getting exactly two heads is 3/8.\n\n2. Probability of getting exactly three heads:\nThere is only 1 way to get three heads (HHH).\nSo, the probability of getting exactly three heads is 1/8.\n\nNow, we add the probabilities of getting exactly two heads and exactly three heads to find the probability of getting at least two heads:\n\nP(at least two heads) = P(exactly two heads) + P(exactly three heads) = (3/8) + (1/8) = 4/8 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least two heads when tossing a fair coin three times is 1/2 or 50%."
