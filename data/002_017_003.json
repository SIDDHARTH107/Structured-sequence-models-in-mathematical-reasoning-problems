    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply by the number of triangles (6 in this case).\n\nAn equilateral triangle with a side length of 5 cm has a height (h) that can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nh^2 + (5/2)^2 = 5^2\nh^2 + 6.25 = 25\nh^2 = 18.75\nh = √18.75 ≈ 4.33 cm\n\nNow, we can find the area of one equilateral triangle:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\nArea = (5 * 4.33) / 2 ≈ 10.83 cm²\n\nFinally, multiply the area of one triangle by the number of triangles in the hexagon:\n\nTotal area = 10.83 cm² * 6 ≈ 64.98 cm²\n\nThe area of the regular hexagon is approximately 64.98 cm²."
