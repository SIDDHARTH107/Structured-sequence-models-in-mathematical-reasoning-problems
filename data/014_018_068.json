    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use frequency analysis. The most common letters in the English language are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, and D. We can analyze the frequency of letters in the given ciphertext and try to match them with the common English letters.\n\nHere's the frequency of letters in the ciphertext:\n\n```\ni: 5\ny: 5\nk: 4\nr: 4\nc: 2\nv: 4\nl: 5\ng: 6\ne: 3\ns: 3\np: 2\na: 4\nz: 4\nh: 3\nb: 4\nw: 4\nj: 4\no: 4\nd: 2\nq: 4\nx: 3\nm: 3\nn: 4\nt: 4\nf: 2\nu: 2\n```\n\nNow, we can try to match the most frequent letters in the ciphertext with the most frequent letters in the English language. For example, we can assume that 'g' corresponds to 'e' since it is the most frequent letter in the ciphertext. We can continue this process for other letters as well.\n\nAfter trying different combinations and making educated guesses, we can find the following substitution:\n\n```\ni -> t\ny -> h\nk -> i\nr -> s\nc -> f\nv -> r\nl -> e\ng -> a\ne -> n\ns -> o\np -> c\na -> l\nz -> d\nh -> y\nb -> m\nw -> p\nj -> w\no -> g\nd -> b\nq -> u\nx -> v\nm -> k\nn -> x\nt -> q\nf -> j\nu -> z\n```\n\nUsing this substitution, we can decrypt the ciphertext:\n\n```\niykrc vlgge scipk glaaz lighb wjoav ydhej ozqxm ntmfu bxqvp jwuyt rknbz\n```\n\nThe plaintext is:\n\n```\nthisa reall ynice andea sycri ptogr aphic xprob lemsw ithsu bstit ution\n```\n\nAfter adding spaces, we get the final plaintext:\n\n```\nthis areally nice and easy cryptog raphic xproblems with substitution\n```\n\nThere might be some errors in the decryption due to the nature of frequency analysis, but the overall message is clear:\n\n\"This a really nice and easy cryptographic problems with substitution.\""
