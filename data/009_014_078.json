The city is growing at a rate of 5% per year. Using the logistic growth model, estimate the population of the city in 10 years.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the logistic growth model formula:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) / P0 * e^(-r * t))\n\nwhere:\nP(t) = population at time t\nK = carrying capacity\nP0 = initial population\nr = growth rate\nt = time in years\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718)\n\nGiven:\nP0 = 10,000\nK = 50,000\nr = 5% per year = 0.05\nt = 10 years\n\nNow, we will plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(10) = 50,000 / (1 + (50,000 - 10,000) / 10,000 * e^(-0.05 * 10))\n\nP(10) = 50,000 / (1 + 40,000 / 10,000 * e^(-0.5))\n\nP(10) = 50,000 / (1 + 4 * e^(-0.5))\n\nNow, we will calculate the value of e^(-0.5):\n\ne^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065\n\nNow, we will plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(10) = 50,000 / (1 + 4 * 0.6065)\n\nP(10) = 50,000 / (1 + 2.426)\n\nP(10) = 50,000 / 3.426\n\nFinally, we will calculate the population of the city in 10 years:\n\nP(10) ≈ 14,582\n\nSo, the estimated population of the city in 10 years is approximately 14,582."
