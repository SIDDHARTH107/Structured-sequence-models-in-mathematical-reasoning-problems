    "message_2": "To determine if G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or a non-abelian group of order 27, we can use the Sylow theorems. Since 27 = 3^3, we know that G has a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 27.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, denoted by n_3, must divide the order of G and be congruent to 1 modulo 3. Since the order of G is 27, the only possible value for n_3 is 1. This means that there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup of order 27, which must be normal in G.\n\nLet P be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Since P is normal in G and has order 27, we know that G is either isomorphic to the cyclic group C27 or a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nNow, we consider the center of G, denoted by Z(G). If G is abelian, then Z(G) = G, and G is isomorphic to C27. If G is non-abelian, then Z(G) is a proper nontrivial subgroup of G. Since the order of G is 27, the order of Z(G) must be a divisor of 27, which means the order of Z(G) can be 1, 3, or 9.\n\nIf the order of Z(G) is 1, then G is a non-abelian simple group of order 27, which is not possible since simple groups have orders that are not prime powers.\n\nIf the order of Z(G) is 3, then G/Z(G) has order 9. Since there is only one group of order 9 up to isomorphism, which is the cyclic group C9, G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C9. However, this is not possible since G is non-abelian, and the quotient group G/Z(G) would be abelian.\n\nIf the order of Z(G) is 9, then G/Z(G) has order 3. Since there is only one group of order 3 up to isomorphism, which is the cyclic group C3, G/Z(G) is isomorphic to C3. In this case, G is a non-abelian group of order 27.\n\nTherefore, G must be isomorphic to a non-abelian group of order 27. An explicit construction of G can be given as follows:\n\nLet G = ⟨a, b | a^9 = b^3 = 1, b^(-1)ab = a^4⟩\n\nIn this construction, G is generated by two elements a and b, where a has order 9, b has order 3, and the commutator relation b^(-1)ab = a^4 holds. This group is non-abelian and has order 27."
