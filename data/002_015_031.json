    "message_2": "To find the perimeter (circumference) of a circular plot of land, we use the formula:\n\nC = πd\n\nwhere C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven that the diameter of the plot of land is 12 meters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(12)\nC ≈ 3.14159(12)\nC ≈ 37.699\n\nThe perimeter (circumference) of the plot of land is approximately 37.699 meters."
