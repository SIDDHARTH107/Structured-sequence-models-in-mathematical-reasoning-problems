    "message_2": "To forecast the number of sales for the next month, we can use a simple linear regression model. First, let's calculate the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) of the regression line.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean of the months (x) and the mean of the sales (y).\n\nMean of months (x̄) = (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12) / 12 = 6.5\nMean of sales (ȳ) = (50+55+57+61+62+68+70+75+77+81+84+87) / 12 = 67.25\n\nStep 2: Calculate the slope (b).\n\nb = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / Σ(xi - x̄)^2\n\nxi = month number\nyi = sales in that month\n\nb = [(1-6.5)(50-67.25) + (2-6.5)(55-67.25) + ... + (12-6.5)(87-67.25)] / [(1-6.5)^2 + (2-6.5)^2 + ... + (12-6.5)^2]\n\nb ≈ 3.3\n\nStep 3: Calculate the y-intercept (a).\n\na = ȳ - b * x̄\na = 67.25 - 3.3 * 6.5\na ≈ 45.65\n\nStep 4: Use the linear regression equation to forecast the sales for the next month (Month 13).\n\ny = a + b * x\ny = 45.65 + 3.3 * 13\ny ≈ 89.55\n\nThe forecast for the number of sales for the next month (Month 13) is approximately 89.55. Since we cannot have a fraction of a sale, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 90 sales."
