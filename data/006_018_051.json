    "message_1": "What is the probability that a company with 10 employees will experience at least one case of financial fraud in a year, given that the probability of fraud occurrence by a single employee is 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the complementary probability. The complementary probability of at least one case of financial fraud is the probability of no financial fraud occurring.\n\nThe probability of no financial fraud occurring for a single employee is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.\n\nFor 10 employees, the probability of no financial fraud occurring for all of them is 0.95^10 ≈ 0.5987.\n\nNow, we can find the complementary probability, which is the probability of at least one case of financial fraud occurring:\n\n1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013\n\nSo, the probability that a company with 10 employees will experience at least one case of financial fraud in a year is approximately 0.4013 or 40.13%."
