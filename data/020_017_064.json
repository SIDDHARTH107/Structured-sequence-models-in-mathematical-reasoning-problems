    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 7 in the range [0, 5], we first find the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b/(2a), where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic and linear terms, respectively.\n\nIn this case, a = 3 and b = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = -(-18) / (2 * 3) = 18 / 6 = 3\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging x = 3 back into the function:\n\nf(3) = 3(3)^2 - 18(3) + 7 = 3(9) - 54 + 7 = 27 - 54 + 7 = -20\n\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is at the point (3, -20). Since the parabola opens upwards (since the coefficient of the x^2 term is positive), this vertex represents the minimum value of the function.\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the range [0, 5] to see if they yield a lower value:\n\nf(0) = 3(0)^2 - 18(0) + 7 = 7\nf(5) = 3(5)^2 - 18(5) + 7 = 3(25) - 90 + 7 = 75 - 90 + 7 = -8\n\nComparing these values to the vertex value, we see that the minimum value of f(x) in the range [0, 5] is -20, which occurs at x = 3."
