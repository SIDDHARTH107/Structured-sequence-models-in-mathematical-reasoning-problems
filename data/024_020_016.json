    "message_2": "The Hopf map is a mapping from the 3-sphere (S^3) to the 2-sphere (S^2). In this case, we are given a unit circle, which is a 1-sphere (S^1). To find the Hopf map for this case, we first need to lift the unit circle to the 3-sphere.\n\nLet's represent a point on the unit circle as (cos(θ), sin(θ)), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. We can lift this point to the 3-sphere by associating it with a quaternion:\n\nq(θ) = cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2)i\n\nNow, we can define the Hopf map from the 3-sphere to the 2-sphere. The Hopf map is given by:\n\nH: S^3 → S^2\nH(q) = q * (0, 0, 1) * conj(q)\n\nwhere q is a quaternion, * represents quaternion multiplication, and conj(q) is the conjugate of q.\n\nFor our lifted unit circle quaternion q(θ), the Hopf map becomes:\n\nH(q(θ)) = (cos(θ/2) + sin(θ/2)i) * (0, 0, 1) * (cos(θ/2) - sin(θ/2)i)\n\nAfter performing the quaternion multiplications, we get:\n\nH(q(θ)) = (cos^2(θ/2) - sin^2(θ/2), 2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2), sin(θ))\n\nNow, we can map this point on the 2-sphere to a point on the unit sphere in 4-dimensional space. Let's represent a point on the unit sphere in 4-dimensional space as (x, y, z, w). We can use the following mapping:\n\n(x, y, z, w) = (cos(θ/2)cos(ϕ/2), cos(θ/2)sin(ϕ/2), sin(θ/2)cos(ϕ/2), sin(θ/2)sin(ϕ/2))\n\nwhere ϕ is an additional angle parameter. Substituting the Hopf map result into this mapping, we get:\n\n(x, y, z, w) = (cos^2(θ/2) - sin^2(θ/2), 2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2), sin(θ), 0)\n\nThis is the explicit formula for the Hopf map of the unit circle to the unit sphere in 4-dimensional space."
