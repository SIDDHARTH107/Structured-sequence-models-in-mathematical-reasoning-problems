    "message_1": "Suppose the weights of apples in a farm are normally distributed with a mean of 150g and a standard deviation of 50g. If a farmer randomly selects 75 apples, what is the probability that their total weight will be between 10kg and 12kg? (Hint: Use the Central Limit Theorem)",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.\n\nIn this case, we have 75 apples, which is a large enough number for the CLT to apply. The mean weight of an apple is 150g, and the standard deviation is 50g. We want to find the probability that the total weight of 75 apples is between 10kg and 12kg.\n\nFirst, let's convert the total weight to grams: 10kg = 10000g and 12kg = 12000g.\n\nNow, let's find the mean and standard deviation for the sum of the weights of 75 apples.\n\nMean of the sum (μ_sum) = n * μ = 75 * 150 = 11250g\nStandard deviation of the sum (σ_sum) = sqrt(n) * σ = sqrt(75) * 50 ≈ 433.01g\n\nNow we need to find the probability that the sum of the weights is between 10000g and 12000g. To do this, we will use the Z-score formula:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nFirst, let's find the Z-scores for 10000g and 12000g:\n\nZ_10000 = (10000 - 11250) / 433.01 ≈ -2.89\nZ_12000 = (12000 - 11250) / 433.01 ≈ 1.73\n\nNow we need to find the probability that the Z-score is between -2.89 and 1.73. We can use a Z-table or a calculator to find the area under the standard normal curve between these two Z-scores:\n\nP(-2.89 < Z < 1.73) ≈ 0.9772 - 0.0019 ≈ 0.9753\n\nSo, the probability that the total weight of 75 apples is between 10kg and 12kg is approximately 0.9753, or 97.53%."
