    "message_2": "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It is a population-based optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling.\n\nHere's a simple implementation of PSO to find the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 5:\n\n1. Initialize the parameters:\n   - Number of particles: n = 30\n   - Number of iterations: max_iter = 100\n   - Inertia weight: w = 0.7\n   - Cognitive acceleration coefficient: c1 = 1.5\n   - Social acceleration coefficient: c2 = 1.5\n   - Search space limits: x_min = -10, x_max = 10\n\n2. Initialize the particles' positions and velocities randomly within the search space limits.\n\n3. Calculate the fitness of each particle using the function f(x).\n\n4. Update each particle's personal best position (pbest) and the global best position (gbest) if the current position has a better fitness.\n\n5. For each iteration:\n   a. Update the velocity of each particle using the following equation:\n      v_i = w * v_i + c1 * rand() * (pbest_i - x_i) + c2 * rand() * (gbest - x_i)\n   b. Update the position of each particle using the equation:\n      x_i = x_i + v_i\n   c. Calculate the fitness of each particle using the function f(x).\n   d. Update each particle's personal best position (pbest) and the global best position (gbest) if the current position has a better fitness.\n   e. Repeat steps a to d until the maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n6. The minimum value of the function f(x) is the fitness of the global best position (gbest).\n\nBy running the PSO algorithm with the given parameters, we can find an approximate minimum value for the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 5. Note that the result may vary slightly due to the random nature of the algorithm. However, the true minimum value of the function can be found analytically by completing the square or using calculus. In this case, the minimum value is 4, which occurs at x = -1."
