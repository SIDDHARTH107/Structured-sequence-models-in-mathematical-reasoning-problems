    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 - y^2 = 0, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to x and y and find the points where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^3 - y^2. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2\n∂f/∂y = -2y\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 = 0 => x = 0\n-2y = 0 => y = 0\n\nThus, the only singular point on the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 - y^2 = 0 is (0, 0)."
