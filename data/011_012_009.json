    "message_2": "Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.\n\nTotal students taking either Music or Art class = students taking Music class + students taking Art class - students taking both classes\n\nTotal students taking either Music or Art class = 45 + 55 - 30 = 70\n\nNow, we have 100 students in total, so the number of students taking neither Music nor Art class is:\n\nTotal students - students taking either Music or Art class = 100 - 70 = 30\n\nSo, 30 students take neither Music nor Art class."
