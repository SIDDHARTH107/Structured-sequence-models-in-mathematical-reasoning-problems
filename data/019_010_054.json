    "message_1": "Given the number of apple trees, orange trees, and pear trees in a fruit orchard, how many trees are there in total if there are twice as many orange trees as apple trees, and the number of pear trees is 5 more than the number of apple trees? If the total number of trees is 63, how many of each type of tree are there?",
    "message_2": "Let A represent the number of apple trees, O represent the number of orange trees, and P represent the number of pear trees.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n1. O = 2A (There are twice as many orange trees as apple trees)\n2. P = A + 5 (The number of pear trees is 5 more than the number of apple trees)\n3. A + O + P = 63 (The total number of trees is 63)\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions from (1) and (2) into the equation (3):\n\nA + (2A) + (A + 5) = 63\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n4A + 5 = 63\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n4A = 58\n\nDivide by 4:\n\nA = 14.5\n\nSince the number of trees must be a whole number, there is an error in the problem statement or the given information. Please check the information provided and try again."
