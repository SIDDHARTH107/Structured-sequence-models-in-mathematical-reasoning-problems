    "message_2": "To find the singular points on the algebraic variety, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x and y, and then find the points where both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nLet f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 5xyz. Then, we compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 5yz\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 5xz\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y) where both partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 5yz = 0\n3y^2 - 5xz = 0\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the singular points. First, we can express x and y in terms of z:\n\nx = (5yz) / (3x^2)\ny = (5xz) / (3y^2)\n\nNow, substitute the expression for y in terms of x and z into the first equation:\n\n3x^2 - 5((5xz) / (3y^2))z = 0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n3x^2 - 25xz^2 / (3y^2) = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 3y^2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n9x^2y^2 - 25xz^2 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out x^2 from the equation:\n\nx^2(9y^2 - 25z^2) = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied if either x^2 = 0 or 9y^2 - 25z^2 = 0. \n\nIf x^2 = 0, then x = 0. In this case, the variety equation becomes y^3 = 0, which implies y = 0. So, the only singular point in this case is (0, 0).\n\nIf 9y^2 - 25z^2 = 0, then we have:\n\n9y^2 = 25z^2\ny^2 = (25/9)z^2\n\nNow, substitute the expression for y^2 back into the expression for y in terms of x and z:\n\ny = (5xz) / (3(25/9)z^2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\ny = (5x) / (25/3)\ny = (15x) / 25\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y back into the variety equation:\n\nx^3 + ((15x) / 25)^3 - 5x((15x) / 25)z = 0\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nx^3 + (3375x^3) / 15625 - (75x^2z) / 25 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 15625 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n15625x^3 + 3375x^3 - 46875x^2z = 0\n\nFactor out x^2 from the equation:\n\nx^2(15625 + 3375 - 46875z) = 0\n\nSince x^2 = 0 already gave us the singular point (0, 0), we can focus on the other factor:\n\n15625 + 3375 - 46875z = 0\n\nSolve for z:\n\n46875z = 15625 + 3375\nz = (15625 + 3375) / 46875\nz = 1/3\n\nNow, substitute z = 1/3 back into the expression for y in terms of x:\n\ny = (15x) / 25\n\nSince z = 1/3, the variety equation becomes:\n\nx^3 + y^3 - 5xy(1/3) = 0\n\nHowever, this equation does not have any additional singular points.\n\nThus, the only singular point on the algebraic variety is (0, 0)."
