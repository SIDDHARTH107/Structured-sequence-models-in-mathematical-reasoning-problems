Each product has a different production time for each machine. What is the minimum time needed to produce all 10 products, assuming each product can only be produced on a specific set of machines?\n\n(Note: you would need to provide additional information such as the production times for each product on each machine, as well as the sets of machines that can produce each product, in order for the student to solve this problem.)",
    "message_2": "In order to solve this problem, we need the production times for each product on each machine and the sets of machines that can produce each product. Since this information is not provided, I will create a sample scenario with the required information.\n\nLet's assume the following production times (in minutes) for each product on each machine:\n\n```\nMachine 1: [10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 35]\nMachine 2: [12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 26, 28, 32, 34, 38]\nMachine 3: [8, 10, 14, 16, 18, 22, 24, 26, 28, 32]\nMachine 4: [15, 18, 20, 24, 26, 28, 30, 34, 36, 40]\nMachine 5: [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28]\nMachine 6: [12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30]\nMachine 7: [14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32]\nMachine 8: [16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34]\n```\n\nAnd let's assume the following sets of machines that can produce each product:\n\n```\nProduct 1: [Machine 1, Machine 3, Machine 5]\nProduct 2: [Machine 2, Machine 4, Machine 6]\nProduct 3: [Machine 1, Machine 3, Machine 7]\nProduct 4: [Machine 2, Machine 4, Machine 8]\nProduct 5: [Machine 1, Machine 5, Machine 7]\nProduct 6: [Machine 2, Machine 6, Machine 8]\nProduct 7: [Machine 3, Machine 5, Machine 7]\nProduct 8: [Machine 4, Machine 6, Machine 8]\nProduct 9: [Machine 1, Machine 3, Machine 5]\nProduct 10: [Machine 2, Machine 4, Machine 6]\n```\n\nNow, we can find the minimum production time for each product by selecting the machine with the shortest production time for that product:\n\n```\nProduct 1: Machine 3 (8 minutes)\nProduct 2: Machine 2 (14 minutes)\nProduct 3: Machine 3 (14 minutes)\nProduct 4: Machine 4 (24 minutes)\nProduct 5: Machine 1 (20 minutes)\nProduct 6: Machine 6 (22 minutes)\nProduct 7: Machine 5 (22 minutes)\nProduct 8: Machine 8 (30 minutes)\nProduct 9: Machine 3 (28 minutes)\nProduct 10: Machine 4 (40 minutes)\n```\n\nNow, we can add up the minimum production times for all products to find the total minimum time needed to produce all 10 products:\n\n8 + 14 + 14 + 24 + 20 + 22 + 22 + 30 + 28 + 40 = 222 minutes\n\nSo, the minimum time needed to produce all 10 products is 222 minutes."
