    "message_2": "To solve this boundary value problem using the Fourier transform, we first need to find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues that satisfy the boundary conditions. We start by assuming a solution of the form:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nPlugging this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$$X(x)T'(t) = kX''(x)T(t)$$\n\nDividing both sides by $kXT$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{T'(t)}{kT(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the separation constant. Now, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n\n1. $T'(t) + k\\lambda T(t) = 0$\n2. $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\nFor the first ODE, the general solution is:\n\n$$T(t) = Ce^{-k\\lambda t}$$\n\nFor the second ODE, since $\\lambda > 0$, the general solution is:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions:\n\n1. $u(0,t) = X(0)T(t) = 0 \\Rightarrow X(0) = 0 \\Rightarrow A = 0$\n2. $u(L,t) = X(L)T(t) = 100 \\Rightarrow X(L) = 100 \\Rightarrow B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}L) = 100$\n\nFrom the first boundary condition, we have:\n\n$$X(x) = B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$$\n\nFrom the second boundary condition, we get the eigenvalues:\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\lambda_n}L = n\\pi \\Rightarrow \\lambda_n = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$$\n\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are:\n\n$$X_n(x) = B_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we can write the solution as a Fourier series:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}B_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)e^{-k\\lambda_n t}$$\n\nTo find the coefficients $B_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = 0$:\n\n$$0 = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}B_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$$\n\nSince the initial condition is identically zero, we can't determine the coefficients $B_n$ directly. However, we can still approximate the solution using the given parameters $k = 1$, $L = \\pi$, $t = 0.5$, and $N = 100$. The solution will be:\n\n$$u(x,t) \\approx \\sum_{n=1}^{100}B_n\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{\\pi}\\right)e^{-\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{\\pi}\\right)^2(0.5)}$$\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine the coefficients $B_n$, we can't provide an explicit solution. However, this is the general form of the solution using the Fourier transform for the given boundary value problem."
