    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that is generated by repeatedly replacing a straight line segment with a specific pattern of smaller line segments. Each iteration increases the length of the curve by a factor of √7.\n\nTo find the total length of the Gosper curve after the first 6 iterations, we can use the formula:\n\nLength = Initial Length * (√7)^n\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after 6 iterations:\n\nLength = 1 * (√7)^6\n\nLength ≈ 1 * 117.6491\n\nLength ≈ 117.65\n\nSo, the total length of the Gosper curve after the first 6 iterations is approximately 117.65, rounded to two decimal places."
