    "message_2": "Let g be an element in G of order 8. By definition, the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e, where e is the identity element in G. Since the order of g is 8, we have g^8 = e.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by g, denoted as H = ⟨g⟩. By definition, H consists of all the powers of g, i.e., H = {e, g, g^2, g^3, ..., g^7}. Since g has order 8, all these powers are distinct. Therefore, H has 8 elements.\n\nSince H is a subgroup of G and has the same number of elements as G, H must be equal to G. Thus, G = ⟨g⟩, which means G is a cyclic group generated by the element g.\n\nNow, let's consider the cyclic group C8, which is generated by an element h, such that C8 = ⟨h⟩ = {e', h, h^2, h^3, ..., h^7}, where e' is the identity element in C8.\n\nWe can define an isomorphism φ: G → C8 as follows:\n\nφ(g^k) = h^k for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 7.\n\nWe will now show that φ is indeed an isomorphism:\n\n1. φ is a homomorphism: For any g^a, g^b in G, we have\n   φ(g^a * g^b) = φ(g^(a+b)) = h^(a+b) = h^a * h^b = φ(g^a) * φ(g^b).\n\n2. φ is injective (one-to-one): If φ(g^a) = φ(g^b), then h^a = h^b. Since h has order 8, this implies that a = b (mod 8). Therefore, g^a = g^b, and φ is injective.\n\n3. φ is surjective (onto): For any h^k in C8, there exists an element g^k in G such that φ(g^k) = h^k. Thus, φ is surjective.\n\nSince φ is a homomorphism, injective, and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, G is isomorphic to C8."
