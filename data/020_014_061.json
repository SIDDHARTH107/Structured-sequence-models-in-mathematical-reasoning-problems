    "message_2": "To find the global maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + x in the interval [-2, 3], we first need to find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 3x^2 + x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 1\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n3x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = -6, and c = 1:\n\nx = (6 ± √((-6)^2 - 4(3)(1))) / (2(3))\nx = (6 ± √(36 - 12)) / 6\nx = (6 ± √24) / 6\n\nThe two possible values for x are:\n\nx = (6 + √24) / 6 ≈ 1.79\nx = (6 - √24) / 6 ≈ 0.21\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval, -2 and 3:\n\nf(-2) = (-2)^3 - 3(-2)^2 + (-2) = -8 - 12 - 2 = -22\nf(0.21) ≈ (0.21)^3 - 3(0.21)^2 + 0.21 ≈ -0.32\nf(1.79) ≈ (1.79)^3 - 3(1.79)^2 + 1.79 ≈ -0.32\nf(3) = (3)^3 - 3(3)^2 + 3 = 27 - 27 + 3 = 3\n\nComparing the values of the function at these points, we find that the global minimum value is -22 at x = -2, and the global maximum value is 3 at x = 3."
