    "message_2": "To factor the polynomial expression 2x^2 + 8x + 6, we can first find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients, which is 2. We can then factor out the GCF:\n\n2(x^2 + 4x + 3)\n\nNow, we need to factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to 3 and add to 4. Those numbers are 1 and 3. So, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n2(x + 1)(x + 3)\n\nThe factored form of the polynomial expression 2x^2 + 8x + 6 is 2(x + 1)(x + 3)."
