    "message_1": "Suppose you have a fair six-sided die that you want to simulate using Monte Carlo simulation. If you roll the die 100 times using the simulation, how many times would you expect to roll a 4 or higher?",
    "message_2": "To simulate rolling a fair six-sided die using Monte Carlo simulation, we can consider the probability of rolling a 4 or higher. There are 3 outcomes (4, 5, and 6) that are 4 or higher, out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a 4 or higher is:\n\nP(4 or higher) = (Number of outcomes 4 or higher) / (Total number of outcomes) = 3/6 = 1/2\n\nSince you are rolling the die 100 times, you would expect to roll a 4 or higher:\n\nExpected number of rolls with 4 or higher = (Probability of rolling 4 or higher) * (Number of rolls) = (1/2) * 100 = 50 times"
