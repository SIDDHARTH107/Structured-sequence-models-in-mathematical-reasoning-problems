    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm and a height of 8 cm. What is the length of its diagonal?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism, we can use the 3D Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the diagonal (d) is equal to the sum of the squares of the length (l), width (w), and height (h) of the prism. In other words:\n\nd^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we can plug in the values:\n\nd^2 = (6 cm)^2 + (4 cm)^2 + (8 cm)^2\nd^2 = 36 cm^2 + 16 cm^2 + 64 cm^2\nd^2 = 116 cm^2\n\nNow, we can find the length of the diagonal by taking the square root of both sides:\n\nd = √(116 cm^2)\nd ≈ 10.77 cm\n\nSo, the length of the diagonal of the rectangular prism is approximately 10.77 cm."
