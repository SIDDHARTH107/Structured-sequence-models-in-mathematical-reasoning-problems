The given differential equation is:\n\ndy/dx = 3x^2\n\nThis is a first-order differential equation, and we can solve it by integrating both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(dy) = ∫(3x^2 dx)\n\ny = x^3 + C\n\nNow we need to find the value of the constant C using the given point (1, 4):\n\n4 = (1)^3 + C\n\n4 = 1 + C\n\nC = 3\n\nSo the particular solution of the differential equation that passes through the point (1, 4) is:\n\ny = x^3 + 3"
