    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function on the interval [-1, 4], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x:\n\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n6x^2 - 18x + 12 = 0\n\nDivide the equation by 6:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = 0\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 2.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-1) = 2(-1)^3 - 9(-1)^2 + 12(-1) = -2 - 9 - 12 = -23\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 12(1) = 2 - 9 + 12 = 5\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 12(2) = 16 - 36 + 24 = 4\nf(4) = 2(4)^3 - 9(4)^2 + 12(4) = 128 - 144 + 48 = 32\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval, we find that the maximum value is 32 at x = 4 and the minimum value is -23 at x = -1."
