    "message_1": "A company has a network of pipelines connecting its factory, warehouse, and retail store. The capacity of the pipelines is as follows:\n\n- Factory to warehouse: 10 units per day\n- Warehouse to retail store: 8 units per day\n- Factory to retail store: 7 units per day\n\nIf the company needs to transport a maximum of 20 units per day from the factory to the retail store, what is the maximum flow that can be sent through the network?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum flow that can be sent through the network, we need to consider the capacities of the pipelines and the possible routes.\n\nThere are two possible routes to transport units from the factory to the retail store:\n\n1. Factory -> Warehouse -> Retail Store\n2. Factory -> Retail Store\n\nFor route 1, the maximum flow is limited by the minimum capacity of the pipelines in the route, which is min(10, 8) = 8 units per day.\n\nFor route 2, the maximum flow is limited by the capacity of the direct pipeline from the factory to the retail store, which is 7 units per day.\n\nTherefore, the maximum flow that can be sent through the network is the sum of the maximum flows of both routes: 8 + 7 = 15 units per day."
