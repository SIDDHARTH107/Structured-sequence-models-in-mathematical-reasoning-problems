Suppose Alice chooses the point P = (5,1) as her public key in an Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem. Bob sends her the message M = (10,12). Encrypt the message M into a cipher text using the Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem.",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message M = (10, 12) using the Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem, Bob needs to do the following steps:\n\n1. Choose a random integer k from the finite field GF(17). Let's say k = 7.\n2. Compute kP, which is the point resulting from adding P to itself k times. In this case, we need to compute 7P.\n3. Compute the ciphertext C1 = kP.\n4. Compute the ciphertext C2 = M + kQ, where Q is Alice's public key.\n\nFirst, let's compute 7P:\n\nWe can use the double-and-add algorithm to compute 7P:\n\nP = (5, 1)\n2P = (6, 3)\n4P = (10, 5)\n7P = 4P + 3P = (10, 5) + (6, 3)\n\nTo compute the point addition, we need the slope λ:\n\nλ = (Y2 - Y1) * (X2 - X1)^(-1) mod 17\nλ = (3 - 5) * (6 - 10)^(-1) mod 17\nλ = (-2) * (-4)^(-1) mod 17\nλ = (-2) * (13) mod 17\nλ = 7\n\nNow, we can compute the resulting point (X3, Y3):\n\nX3 = λ^2 - X1 - X2 mod 17\nX3 = 7^2 - 10 - 6 mod 17\nX3 = 49 - 10 - 6 mod 17\nX3 = 33 mod 17\nX3 = 16\n\nY3 = λ(X1 - X3) - Y1 mod 17\nY3 = 7(10 - 16) - 5 mod 17\nY3 = 7(-6) - 5 mod 17\nY3 = (-42) - 5 mod 17\nY3 = -47 mod 17\nY3 = 4\n\nSo, 7P = (16, 4). Now, we can compute the ciphertexts C1 and C2:\n\nC1 = kP = (16, 4)\n\nTo compute C2, we need to find kQ:\n\nQ = P (since Alice's public key is P)\nkQ = 7P = (16, 4)\n\nNow, we can compute C2:\n\nC2 = M + kQ = (10, 12) + (16, 4)\n\nAgain, we need the slope λ:\n\nλ = (Y2 - Y1) * (X2 - X1)^(-1) mod 17\nλ = (4 - 12) * (16 - 10)^(-1) mod 17\nλ = (-8) * (6)^(-1) mod 17\nλ = (-8) * (3) mod 17\nλ = 1\n\nNow, we can compute the resulting point (X3, Y3):\n\nX3 = λ^2 - X1 - X2 mod 17\nX3 = 1^2 - 10 - 16 mod 17\nX3 = 1 - 10 - 16 mod 17\nX3 = -25 mod 17\nX3 = 9\n\nY3 = λ(X1 - X3) - Y1 mod 17\nY3 = 1(10 - 9) - 12 mod 17\nY3 = 1 - 12 mod 17\nY3 = -11 mod 17\nY3 = 6\n\nSo, C2 = (9, 6).\n\nThe encrypted message (ciphertext) is the pair of points (C1, C2) = ((16, 4), (9, 6))."
