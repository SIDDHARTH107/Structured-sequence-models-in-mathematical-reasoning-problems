    "message_1": "In a group of six people, what is the minimum number of handshakes needed such that there are either three people who have shaken hands with one another, or three people who have not shaken hands with one another?",
    "message_2": "We can solve this problem using the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider the number of handshakes each person has.\n\nCase 1: At least one person has shaken hands with at least 3 other people.\nIf this is true, then either this person and two of the people they shook hands with form a group of three who have shaken hands with one another, or the other two people in the group form a group of three who have not shaken hands with one another.\n\nCase 2: Every person has shaken hands with at most 2 other people.\nIn this case, there are a total of 6 people, so there must be at least 3 people who have shaken hands with exactly 2 other people. Let's call these people A, B, and C. If any of A, B, or C have shaken hands with each other, then we have a group of three who have shaken hands with one another. If none of A, B, or C have shaken hands with each other, then they form a group of three who have not shaken hands with one another.\n\nSo in either case, we must have either a group of three who have shaken hands with one another or a group of three who have not shaken hands with one another.\n\nNow let's find the minimum number of handshakes needed. If each person shakes hands with 2 other people, there will be a total of (6 * 2) / 2 = 6 handshakes. However, this configuration does not guarantee the condition we want. If we add one more handshake, we will have a total of 7 handshakes. In this case, at least one person will have shaken hands with 3 other people, which, as we showed earlier, guarantees that either a group of three who have shaken hands with one another or a group of three who have not shaken hands with one another will exist.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of handshakes needed is 7."
