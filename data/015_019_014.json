    "message_2": "The Henon-Heiles system is a Hamiltonian system with the following Hamiltonian:\n\nH(x, y, px, py) = 1/2 (px^2 + py^2) + 1/2 (x^2 + y^2) + x^2*y - 1/3*y^3\n\nGiven the initial conditions x=0, y=0, px=0.2, and py=0.2, we can calculate the initial energy value:\n\nH(0, 0, 0.2, 0.2) = 1/2 (0.2^2 + 0.2^2) + 1/2 (0^2 + 0^2) + 0^2*0 - 1/3*0^3\nH(0, 0, 0.2, 0.2) = 1/2 (0.04 + 0.04)\nH(0, 0, 0.2, 0.2) = 1/2 (0.08)\nH(0, 0, 0.2, 0.2) = 0.04\n\nThe initial energy value is 0.04. Since the Henon-Heiles system is a conservative system, the energy value will remain constant throughout the motion. Therefore, the maximum energy value that the system can reach with these initial conditions is 0.04."
