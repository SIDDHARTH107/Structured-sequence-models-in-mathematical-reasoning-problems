    "message_2": "To find the area of a regular hexagon, we can divide it into equilateral triangles and find the area of one of those triangles, then multiply by 6 (since there are 6 equilateral triangles in a hexagon).\n\nThe side length of each equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the hexagon, which is 8 cm. To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (side length² * √3) / 4\n\nPlugging in the side length of 8 cm:\n\nArea = (8² * √3) / 4\nArea = (64 * √3) / 4\nArea = 16√3 square centimeters\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one equilateral triangle by 6 to find the area of the hexagon:\n\nArea of hexagon = 6 * (16√3)\nArea of hexagon = 96√3 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the hexagon is 96√3 square centimeters."
