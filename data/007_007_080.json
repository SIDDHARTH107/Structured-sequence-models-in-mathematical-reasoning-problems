    "message_2": "To find the integer solutions for the equation 2x + 7y = 101, we can use the Diophantine equation method.\n\nFirst, we check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the coefficients of x and y (2 and 7) divides the constant term (101). Since the GCD of 2 and 7 is 1, and 1 divides 101, there exist integer solutions for this equation.\n\nNow, we need to find a particular solution. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 7.\n\n2 * 4 = 8 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nSo, the modular inverse of 2 modulo 7 is 4.\n\nNow, multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n4 * (2x + 7y) = 4 * 101\n8x + 28y = 404\n\nNow, reduce the equation modulo 7:\n\nx ≡ 4 * 101 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 404 (mod 7)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nSo, one particular solution for x is 3. To find the corresponding value for y, substitute x = 3 into the original equation:\n\n2 * 3 + 7y = 101\n6 + 7y = 101\n7y = 95\ny = 95 / 7\ny = 13\n\nSo, one particular solution is (x, y) = (3, 13).\n\nNow, we can find the general solution for the equation. The general solution is given by:\n\nx = x0 + 7t\ny = y0 - 2t\n\nwhere (x0, y0) is the particular solution we found, and t is an integer.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nx = 3 + 7t\ny = 13 - 2t\n\nFor different values of t, we get different integer solutions:\n\nt = 0: (x, y) = (3, 13)\nt = 1: (x, y) = (10, 11)\nt = -1: (x, y) = (-4, 15)\n\nAnd so on. These are the integer solutions for the given equation."
