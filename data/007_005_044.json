    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 24, 30, 36, and 48, we first need to find the prime factors of each number:\n\n24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n30 = 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n48 = 2^4 * 3^1\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:\n\n2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1\n\nFinally, we multiply these prime factors together to get the LCM:\n\n2^4 * 3^2 * 5^1 = 16 * 9 * 5 = 1440\n\nSo, the LCM of 24, 30, 36, and 48 is 1440."
