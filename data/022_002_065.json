    "message_2": "To find the image of the unit circle under the conformal map $f(z) = \\frac{1}{z}$, we first parameterize the unit circle as $z = e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle in radians and $0 \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi$. Now, we apply the conformal map to this parameterization:\n\n$$f(z) = f(e^{i\\theta}) = \\frac{1}{e^{i\\theta}} = e^{-i\\theta}$$\n\nSince $|e^{-i\\theta}| = 1$, the image of the unit circle under the conformal map is still a circle with radius 1. However, the orientation of the circle is reversed, as the angle $\\theta$ is negated. This means that the image of the unit circle is another unit circle centered at the origin, but with the orientation reversed.\n\nTo sketch this in the complex plane, simply draw a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. The orientation reversal is not visible in the sketch, as it only affects the traversal direction along the circle."
