    "message_2": "To determine how many widgets the machine can produce in an hour, we first need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 60 by 10:\n\n60 minutes / 10 minutes = 6 intervals\n\nSince the machine can produce 5 widgets in 10 minutes, we multiply the number of widgets by the number of intervals to find the total number of widgets produced in an hour:\n\n5 widgets * 6 intervals = 30 widgets\n\nThe machine can produce 30 widgets in an hour."
