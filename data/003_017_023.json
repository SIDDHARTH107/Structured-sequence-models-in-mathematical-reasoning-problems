    "message_1": "A lighthouse shines its light in a circular pattern, with its beam covering an area of 120°. The height of the lighthouse is 100 meters. What is the average value of the sine function for angles in the region covered by the lighthouse beam?",
    "message_2": "To find the average value of the sine function for angles in the region covered by the lighthouse beam, we need to integrate the sine function over the interval and then divide by the length of the interval.\n\nThe lighthouse beam covers an area of 120°, which is equivalent to (120/180)π radians or (2/3)π radians. Since the beam is symmetric around the vertical axis, we can consider the interval from 0 to (1/3)π radians and then multiply the result by 2.\n\nThe average value of the sine function over the interval [0, (1/3)π] can be found using the following formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/((1/3)π - 0)) * ∫[sin(x) dx] from 0 to (1/3)π\n\nFirst, we need to find the integral of sin(x) with respect to x:\n\n∫[sin(x) dx] = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the integral at the bounds 0 and (1/3)π:\n\n[-cos((1/3)π) + C] - [-cos(0) + C] = -cos((1/3)π) + cos(0)\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the average value formula:\n\nAverage value = (1/((1/3)π)) * (-cos((1/3)π) + cos(0))\n\nAverage value = (3/π) * (-cos((1/3)π) + cos(0))\n\nAverage value = (3/π) * (-(-1/2) + 1)\n\nAverage value = (3/π) * (1/2 + 1)\n\nAverage value = (3/π) * (3/2)\n\nNow, we need to multiply this result by 2 since we only considered half of the interval:\n\nFinal average value = 2 * (3/π) * (3/2) = (9/π)\n\nSo, the average value of the sine function for angles in the region covered by the lighthouse beam is 9/π."
