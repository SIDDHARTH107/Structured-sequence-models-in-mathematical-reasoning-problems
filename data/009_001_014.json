    "message_1": "A species of bacteria has an initial population of 300 and grows at a rate proportional to its population size. It is observed that after 5 hours, the population has grown to 600. \n\nWhat is the population of the bacteria 10 hours after the initial observation?",
    "message_2": "Let P(t) be the population of the bacteria at time t. Since the growth rate is proportional to the population size, we can model the growth using the exponential growth equation:\n\nP(t) = P(0) * e^(kt)\n\nwhere P(0) is the initial population, k is the growth constant, and t is the time in hours.\n\nWe are given that P(0) = 300 and P(5) = 600. We can use this information to find the growth constant k.\n\n600 = 300 * e^(5k)\n\nDivide both sides by 300:\n\n2 = e^(5k)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = 5k\n\nNow, solve for k:\n\nk = ln(2) / 5\n\nNow that we have the growth constant k, we can find the population 10 hours after the initial observation, which is 15 hours after the start:\n\nP(15) = 300 * e^(15 * (ln(2) / 5))\n\nP(15) ≈ 300 * e^(3 * ln(2))\n\nP(15) ≈ 300 * 2^3\n\nP(15) ≈ 300 * 8\n\nP(15) ≈ 2400\n\nSo, the population of the bacteria 10 hours after the initial observation is approximately 2400."
