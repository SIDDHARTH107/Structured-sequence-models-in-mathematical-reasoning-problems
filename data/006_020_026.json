    "message_1": "Consider a small town with a population of 5000 people. Out of these, 60% are men and 40% are women. If a social event is organized and 30% of men and 50% of women attend the event, what is the probability that a person chosen at random in this town has attended the social event? Round your answer to two decimal places.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find out how many men and women are in the town.\n\nMen: 5000 * 0.60 = 3000\nWomen: 5000 * 0.40 = 2000\n\nNow, let's find out how many men and women attended the event.\n\nMen attending the event: 3000 * 0.30 = 900\nWomen attending the event: 2000 * 0.50 = 1000\n\nTotal attendees: 900 (men) + 1000 (women) = 1900\n\nNow, we can find the probability that a person chosen at random in this town has attended the social event.\n\nProbability = (Total attendees) / (Total population) = 1900 / 5000 = 0.38\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the probability is 0.38 or 38%."
