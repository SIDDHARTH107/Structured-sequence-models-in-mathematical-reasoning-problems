    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Stirling numbers of the second kind, which represent the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 6 items and k = 4 boxes. The Stirling number of the second kind is denoted as S(n, k).\n\nUsing the formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nWe can calculate the values for S(6, 4):\n\nS(6, 4) = 4 * S(5, 4) + S(5, 3)\n\nTo find S(5, 4) and S(5, 3), we can use the same formula:\n\nS(5, 4) = 4 * S(4, 4) + S(4, 3)\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\n\nNow, we need to find S(4, 4), S(4, 3), and S(4, 2):\n\nS(4, 4) = 1 (since there's only one way to put 4 items into 4 boxes with no box empty)\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)\n\nContinuing with the calculations:\n\nS(3, 3) = 1 (since there's only one way to put 3 items into 3 boxes with no box empty)\nS(3, 2) = 3 (since there are 3 ways to put 3 items into 2 boxes with no box empty)\nS(3, 1) = 1 (since there's only one way to put 3 items into 1 box)\n\nNow we can find S(4, 3) and S(4, 2):\n\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(4, 2) = 2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1) = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7\n\nFinally, we can find S(5, 4) and S(5, 3):\n\nS(5, 4) = 4 * S(4, 4) + S(4, 3) = 4 * 1 + 6 = 10\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2) = 3 * 6 + 7 = 25\n\nNow we can find S(6, 4):\n\nS(6, 4) = 4 * S(5, 4) + S(5, 3) = 4 * 10 + 25 = 65\n\nSo there are 65 ways to put 6 items into 4 distinct boxes such that no box remains empty."
