    "message_2": "Euler's totient function, φ(n), counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. To compute φ(n) for a given number n, we can use the formula:\n\nφ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n.\n\nFor the number 30, the prime factors are 2, 3, and 5. So, we can calculate φ(30) as follows:\n\nφ(30) = 30 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/5)\nφ(30) = 30 * (1/2) * (2/3) * (4/5)\nφ(30) = 30 * (1/3) * (4/5)\nφ(30) = 30 * (4/15)\nφ(30) = 8\n\nSo, the value of Euler's totient function for the number 30 is 8."
