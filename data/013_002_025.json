Jane can also choose between two strategies: strategy C or strategy D. The payoff matrix for the game is as follows:\n\n    |  C  |  D  |\n----|----|----|\nA   |  1  | -1  |\n----|----|----|\nB   | -2  |  3  |\n\nWhat is the Nash equilibrium of this game?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to identify the best responses for each player given the other player's strategy.\n\n1. If Jane chooses strategy C, John's best response is strategy A, as 1 > -2.\n2. If Jane chooses strategy D, John's best response is strategy B, as 3 > -1.\n\nNow, let's look at Jane's best responses:\n\n1. If John chooses strategy A, Jane's best response is strategy C, as 1 > -1.\n2. If John chooses strategy B, Jane's best response is strategy D, as 3 > -2.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both players choose their best response given the other player's strategy. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is (A, C), where John chooses strategy A and Jane chooses strategy C. The payoff for this equilibrium is 1 for both players."
