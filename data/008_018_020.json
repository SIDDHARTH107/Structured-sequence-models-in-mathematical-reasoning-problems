    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using block matrices, we first need to rewrite the system in matrix form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables (x, y, z), and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 3  2 -1 |\n    | 1 -1  2 |\n    | 4  3 -2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nB = | 10 |\n    | -1 |\n    | 16 |\n\nNow, we can use the block matrix method to solve for X. The block matrix method involves finding the inverse of matrix A and then multiplying it by matrix B to get the solution matrix X.\n\nFirst, let's find the inverse of matrix A. To do this, we'll use the formula A^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where det(A) is the determinant of A and adj(A) is the adjugate of A.\n\nStep 1: Find the determinant of A.\ndet(A) = 3((-1)(-2) - (2)(3)) - 2((1)(-2) - (2)(4)) - (-1)((1)(3) - (-1)(4))\n       = 3(4 - 6) - 2(-2 - 8) - (-1)(3 + 4)\n       = 3(-2) + 2(10) + 7\n       = -6 + 20 + 7\n       = 21\n\nStep 2: Find the adjugate of A.\nadj(A) = | (-1)(-2) - (2)(3)   (1)(-2) - (2)(4)   (1)(3) - (-1)(4) |\n         | (2)(-2) - (3)(-1)   (3)(-2) - (4)(1)   (4)(3) - (3)(2)  |\n         | (2)(2) - (-1)(-1)   (1)(2) - (4)(-1)   (1)(1) - (4)(2)  |\n\nadj(A) = | -4 + 6   -2 + 8   3 + 4 |\n         | -4 + 3   -6 + 4   12 - 6 |\n         |  4 - 1    2 + 4   1 - 8  |\n\nadj(A) = |  2   6   7 |\n         | -1  -2   6 |\n         |  3   6  -7 |\n\nStep 3: Find the inverse of A.\nA^(-1) = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)\n       = (1/21) * |  2   6   7 |\n                  | -1  -2   6 |\n                  |  3   6  -7 |\n\nStep 4: Multiply A^(-1) by B to get X.\nX = A^(-1) * B\n  = (1/21) * |  2   6   7 | * | 10 |\n             | -1  -2   6 |   | -1 |\n             |  3   6  -7 |   | 16 |\n\n  = (1/21) * | 2(10) + 6(-1) + 7(16) |\n             | -1(10) - 2(-1) + 6(16) |\n             | 3(10) + 6(-1) - 7(16) |\n\n  = (1/21) * | 20 - 6 + 112 |\n             | -10 + 2 + 96  |\n             | 30 - 6 - 112  |\n\n  = (1/21) * | 126 |\n             |  88  |\n             | -88  |\n\n  = | 6 |\n    | 4 |\n    | -4 |\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is x = 6, y = 4, and z = -4."
