    "message_2": "To determine the number of edges in graph G, we can use the Handshaking Lemma. The Handshaking Lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, the degree sequence is {3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1}. We can find the sum of the degrees:\n\n3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 12\n\nNow, we can use the Handshaking Lemma:\n\nSum of degrees = 2 * number of edges\n\n12 = 2 * number of edges\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nnumber of edges = 6\n\nSo, the graph G has 6 edges."
