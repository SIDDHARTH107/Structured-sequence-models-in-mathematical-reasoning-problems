    "message_2": "Let's denote the people as A, B, C, D, E, and F. We can represent the friendships between them using a graph, where each person is a vertex and an edge between two vertices represents a friendship.\n\nSince each person is friends with at least 3 others, we can start by connecting A to B, C, and D. Now, we need to make sure B, C, and D have at least 3 friends as well. If B is friends with both C and D, then we already have a group of 3 people who are all friends with each other (A, B, and C or A, B, and D). So, to minimize the number of such groups, we can assume that B is not friends with C or D. Instead, B can be friends with E and F.\n\nNow, we have the following friendships: A-B, A-C, A-D, B-E, and B-F. We still need to make sure C, D, E, and F have at least 3 friends each. If C is friends with D, then we have a group of 3 people who are all friends with each other (A, C, and D). So, to minimize the number of such groups, we can assume that C is not friends with D. Instead, C can be friends with E and F.\n\nNow, we have the following friendships: A-B, A-C, A-D, B-E, B-F, C-E, and C-F. We still need to make sure D, E, and F have at least 3 friends each. If D is friends with E or F, then we have a group of 3 people who are all friends with each other (A, D, and E or A, D, and F). So, to minimize the number of such groups, we can assume that D is not friends with E or F. Instead, D can be friends with G.\n\nHowever, we only have 6 people in the group, so we cannot add a new person G. Therefore, D must be friends with either E or F. Without loss of generality, let's assume D is friends with E. Now, we have a group of 3 people who are all friends with each other (A, D, and E).\n\nThus, the minimum number of groups of 3 people that need to be formed to ensure that there is at least one group where all members are friends with each other is 1."
