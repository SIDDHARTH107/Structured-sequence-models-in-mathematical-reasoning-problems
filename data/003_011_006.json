    "message_1": "A student is standing at the bottom of a hill, 200 feet away from the base of the hill. The angle of elevation to the top of the hill is 30 degrees. How tall is the hill?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, we have the angle of elevation (30 degrees) and the distance from the student to the base of the hill (200 feet). We want to find the height of the hill, which is the side opposite the angle.\n\nWe can set up the equation using the tangent function:\n\ntan(30°) = height / 200 feet\n\nTo find the height, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 200 feet:\n\nheight = 200 feet * tan(30°)\n\nNow, we can use a calculator to find the tangent of 30 degrees:\n\ntan(30°) ≈ 0.577\n\nNow, we can plug this value back into our equation:\n\nheight ≈ 200 feet * 0.577\n\nheight ≈ 115.4 feet\n\nSo, the height of the hill is approximately 115.4 feet."
