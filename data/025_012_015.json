    "message_2": "To find the group of rational points on the elliptic curve defined by $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$ over the field of rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$), we can use the Mordell-Weil theorem. The theorem states that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve over a number field is finitely generated. In other words, it is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\nThe group of rational points on the elliptic curve can be written as $E(\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T$, where $r$ is the rank of the curve and $T$ is the torsion subgroup consisting of points of finite order.\n\nTo find the torsion subgroup, we can use the Mazur's torsion theorem, which states that the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $1 \\leq n \\leq 10$ or $n = 12$\n2. $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $1 \\leq n \\leq 4$\n\nTo find the rank, we can use the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, which relates the rank to the order of vanishing of the L-function associated with the elliptic curve at the point 1. However, this conjecture is still unproven for general elliptic curves, and finding the rank in general is a difficult problem.\n\nFor this specific elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 7$, we can use a computer algebra system like SageMath or PARI/GP to find the torsion subgroup and the rank. Using SageMath, we can find that the torsion subgroup is trivial (i.e., it consists only of the point at infinity), and the rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the group of rational points on the elliptic curve is $E(\\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Z}$."
