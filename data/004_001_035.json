    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 4, we will apply the power rule for each term. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nFor the first term, 5x^3:\nThe derivative is 3 * 5x^(3-1) = 15x^2.\n\nFor the second term, -2x^2:\nThe derivative is 2 * -2x^(2-1) = -4x.\n\nFor the third term, 7x:\nThe derivative is 1 * 7x^(1-1) = 7.\n\nFor the fourth term, -4:\nSince it's a constant, its derivative is 0.\n\nNow, we add up the derivatives of each term to find the derivative of the entire function:\n\nf'(x) = 15x^2 - 4x + 7"
