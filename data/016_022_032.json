    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron, is a fractal formed by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedra. In each stage, the number of equilateral triangles increases by a factor of 4.\n\nIn the first stage, there is 1 equilateral triangle (the original tetrahedron).\nIn the second stage, there are 4 equilateral triangles.\nIn the third stage, there are 4^2 = 16 equilateral triangles.\nIn the fourth stage, there are 4^3 = 64 equilateral triangles.\n\nSo, in the fifth stage of the Sierpinski pyramid construction, there are 4^4 = 256 equilateral triangles."
