    "message_1": "Sure, here's a possible problem:\n\nA sample of a radioactive material has a half-life of 20 years. If the initial mass of the sample was 500 g, find the mass of the sample after 80 years. Round your answer to the nearest gram.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for radioactive decay:\n\nFinal mass = Initial mass * (1/2)^(time elapsed / half-life)\n\nIn this case, the initial mass is 500 g, the half-life is 20 years, and the time elapsed is 80 years. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^(80 / 20)\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/2)^4\n\nFinal mass = 500 * (1/16)\n\nFinal mass = 31.25 g\n\nRounding to the nearest gram, the mass of the sample after 80 years is approximately 31 g."
