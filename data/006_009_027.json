    "message_2": "To find the expected number of people with the medical condition, you can multiply the population size by the probability of having the condition:\n\nExpected number = Population size × Probability of having the condition\n\nExpected number = 5000 × 0.025\n\nExpected number = 125\n\nSo, the expected number of people in this population who have the medical condition is 125."
