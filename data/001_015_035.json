    "message_2": "To solve the exponential equation 3^(2x+1) = 27, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Rewrite the equation with the same base on both sides\nSince 27 is a power of 3 (27 = 3^3), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3^(2x+1) = 3^3\n\nStep 2: Set the exponents equal to each other\nSince the bases are equal, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n2x + 1 = 3\n\nStep 3: Solve for x\nSubtract 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2x = 2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the exponential equation 3^(2x+1) = 27 is x = 1."
