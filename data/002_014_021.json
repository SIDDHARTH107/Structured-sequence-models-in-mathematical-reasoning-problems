    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 8 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm. What is the total surface area of the rectangular prism?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to find the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area (SA) of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSA = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: l = 8 cm, w = 6 cm, and h = 4 cm.\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\nSA = 2(8)(6) + 2(8)(4) + 2(6)(4)\nSA = 96 + 64 + 48\nSA = 208\n\nThe total surface area of the rectangular prism is 208 square centimeters."
