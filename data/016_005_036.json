    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set obtained by removing the middle third of a line segment of length 1, then removing the middle thirds of the two line segments that remain, and so on, can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1 / r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Cantor set, after each iteration, there are N = 2 self-similar pieces, and the scaling factor is r = 1/3 (since we remove the middle third of each segment).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) is:\n\nD = log(2) / log(1 / (1/3))\nD = log(2) / log(3)\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the Cantor set is approximately 0.6309."
