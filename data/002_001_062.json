    "message_1": "A triangle has a base of 8 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is the area of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base is 8 cm and the height is 12 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nArea = (8 * 12) / 2\n\nArea = 96 / 2\n\nArea = 48 square centimeters\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 48 square centimeters."
