    "message_1": "Consider the following system of linear equations:\n\n2x + 3y + 4z = 10\n\n5x + 6y + 7z = 20\n\n8x + 9y + 10z = 30\n\nUsing Gaussian elimination, find the values of x, y and z that satisfy the above system of linear equations.",
    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we will first write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n|  2  3  4 | 10 |\n|  5  6  7 | 20 |\n|  8  9 10 | 30 |\n\nNow, we will perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (row-echelon form).\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2.5 times the first row from the second row, and 4 times the first row from the third row:\n\n|  2   3   4 | 10 |\n|  0  -1.5 -3 | -5 |\n|  0  -3  -6 | -10 |\n\nStep 2: Multiply the second row by -2/3 to make the pivot element in the second row equal to 1:\n\n|  2   3    4 |  10 |\n|  0   1    2 |   5 |\n|  0  -3   -6 | -10 |\n\nStep 3: Add 3 times the second row to the third row:\n\n|  2   3   4 |  10 |\n|  0   1   2 |   5 |\n|  0   0   0 |   5 |\n\nNow, we can see that the third row represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 5, which is a contradiction. This means that the given system of linear equations has no solution."
