    "message_2": "a) Since the order of G is 9, by the Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow 3-subgroup H of order 3 in G. Let n_3 be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups in G. By the third Sylow theorem, n_3 must divide the order of G (which is 9) and n_3 must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The only possibility for n_3 is 1, which means that there is a unique subgroup of order 3 in G, say H.\n\nb) If H is normal in G, then we can consider the quotient group G/H. Since the order of G is 9 and the order of H is 3, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of G/H is 9/3 = 3. Therefore, G/H is a cyclic group of order 3, say G/H = <xH>.\n\nNow, let g be an element in G. Since G/H is generated by xH, there exists an integer n such that gH = (xH)^n = x^nH. This implies that g is in the coset x^nH, which means g = x^n * h for some h in H. Since H has order 3, h can be one of the following: e (identity), h_1, or h_2, where h_1 and h_2 are the non-identity elements of H. Thus, every element in G can be written as a product of a power of x and an element of H.\n\nNow, let's consider the element x^3. Since G/H has order 3, x^3H = H, which implies that x^3 is in H. Since H has order 3, x^3 must be equal to either e, h_1, or h_2. If x^3 = h_1 or x^3 = h_2, then x^6 = h_1^2 or x^6 = h_2^2, which contradicts the fact that x^6H = H. Thus, x^3 = e, and x has order 9 in G. Therefore, G is generated by x and is isomorphic to the cyclic group C9.\n\nc) If H is not normal in G, then G cannot be abelian, as all subgroups of an abelian group are normal. Since G has order 9, by the classification of finite abelian groups, the only abelian group of order 9 is the cyclic group C9. Since G is not abelian, it cannot be isomorphic to C9.\n\nNow, let's consider the multiplication of elements in G. Since every element in G can be written as a product of a power of x and an element of H, the multiplication in G can be described by the following rule:\n\n(x^a * h_i)(x^b * h_j) = x^(a+b) * h_k,\n\nwhere a, b are integers modulo 9, and i, j, k are integers modulo 3. This multiplication rule defines a non-abelian group of order 9, which we will call N9. Since G is not abelian and has order 9, it must be isomorphic to N9."
