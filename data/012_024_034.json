    "message_2": "To determine the genus of the graph, we can use the Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2 - 2g\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, F is the number of faces, and g is the genus of the graph.\n\nIn this graph, we have:\nV = 8 (vertices: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H)\nE = 11 (edges: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, BE, DE, DF, EF, EG, GH)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of faces (F) in the graph. We can do this by counting the number of regions enclosed by the edges of the graph. In this case, we have 5 faces: ABCDA, ADEG, DEBC, DEHF, and EFGH.\n\nNow we can plug these values into Euler's formula:\n\n8 - 11 + 5 = 2 - 2g\n2 = 2 - 2g\ng = 0\n\nThe genus of the graph is 0, which means it is a planar graph. Therefore, the minimum number of non-intersecting closed curves that can be drawn on the surface without cutting through any of the edges of the graph is 0."
