    "message_2": "Let A be a connected subset of Y, and let B be the closure of A in Y (i.e., the smallest closed subset of Y containing A). We want to show that B is connected.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that B is not connected. Then there exist non-empty open sets U and V in the subspace topology of Y such that B = U ∪ V, and U ∩ V = ∅. Since U and V are open in Y, there exist open sets U' and V' in the topology T of X such that U = U' ∩ Y and V = V' ∩ Y.\n\nNow, consider the sets A ∩ U and A ∩ V. These sets are non-empty (since A ⊆ U ∪ V), and open in A (since A is connected). Moreover, A = (A ∩ U) ∪ (A ∩ V), and (A ∩ U) ∩ (A ∩ V) = ∅. This contradicts the fact that A is connected, so our assumption that B is not connected must be false.\n\nTherefore, the closure of a connected subset of Y is connected."
