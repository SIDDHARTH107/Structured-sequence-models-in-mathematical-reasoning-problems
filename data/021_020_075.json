    "message_1": "A company produces two products, A and B, and has a production capacity of 800 units per week. Product A requires 4 hours of machine time and 2 hours of labor per unit, while Product B requires 3 hours of machine time and 4 hours of labor per unit. The company makes a profit of $10 per unit of A and $15 per unit of B. \n\nUsing the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm, what is the maximum profit the company can achieve per week?",
    "message_2": "The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees. To apply the ABC algorithm to this problem, we need to define the objective function, constraints, and parameters for the algorithm.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 10 * A + 15 * B\n\nConstraints:\n1. A + B <= 800 (production capacity constraint)\n2. 4A + 3B <= machine time constraint\n3. 2A + 4B <= labor time constraint\n\nParameters for the ABC algorithm:\n- Number of employed bees\n- Number of onlooker bees\n- Maximum number of iterations\n- Limit for abandoning a food source\n\nNow, we can apply the ABC algorithm to search for the optimal solution. However, as a mathematician, I cannot execute the ABC algorithm directly. Instead, I can provide you with the linear programming solution to this problem, which can be solved using the simplex method or other optimization techniques.\n\nLet's first find the constraints in terms of machine time and labor time:\n\nMachine time constraint: Let's assume the company has M hours of machine time available per week.\n4A + 3B <= M\n\nLabor time constraint: Let's assume the company has L hours of labor time available per week.\n2A + 4B <= L\n\nNow, we can solve the linear programming problem using the simplex method or other optimization techniques. The optimal solution will give us the maximum profit the company can achieve per week.\n\nPlease provide the available machine time (M) and labor time (L) per week, and I can help you find the optimal solution and maximum profit."
