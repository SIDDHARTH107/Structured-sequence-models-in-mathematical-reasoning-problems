    "message_2": "The total length of a Hilbert Curve of order n can be calculated using the formula L = 4^n, where L is the total length and n is the order of the curve. \n\nFor a Hilbert Curve of order 4, the total length would be:\n\nL = 4^4 = 256\n\nSo, the total length of the Hilbert Curve of order 4 with each segment of length 1 is 256."
