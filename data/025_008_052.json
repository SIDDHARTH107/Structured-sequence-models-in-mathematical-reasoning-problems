    "message_2": "Using Hodge theory, we can relate the dimension of the vector space of holomorphic one-forms on X to the genus g of the curve. For a smooth projective algebraic curve X of genus g, the Hodge diamond is given by:\n\n```\n  1\n  g\n  1\n```\n\nThe Hodge diamond represents the Hodge numbers h^{p,q} of the curve, where h^{p,q} is the dimension of the vector space of (p,q)-forms on X. In our case, we are interested in the dimension of the vector space of holomorphic one-forms, which corresponds to the Hodge number h^{1,0}.\n\nFrom the Hodge diamond, we can see that h^{1,0} = g. Since the genus g of the curve X is given as 3, the dimension of the vector space of holomorphic one-forms on X is also 3."
