    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 using nonlinear programming techniques, we can use the first and second derivative tests.\n\nFirst, we find the first derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d(2x^2 - 5x + 3)/dx = 4x - 5\n\nNow, we set the first derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n4x - 5 = 0\n4x = 5\nx = 5/4\n\nNext, we find the second derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf''(x) = d(4x - 5)/dx = 4\n\nSince the second derivative f''(x) is positive, the critical point x = 5/4 corresponds to a local minimum. As the function is a parabola, this local minimum is also the global minimum.\n\nFinally, we find the minimum value of f(x) by plugging the critical point x = 5/4 back into the original function:\n\nf(5/4) = 2(5/4)^2 - 5(5/4) + 3\n       = 2(25/16) - 25/4 + 3\n       = 50/16 - 100/16 + 48/16\n       = -2/16\n       = -1/8\n\nSo, the minimum value of f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x + 3 is -1/8."
