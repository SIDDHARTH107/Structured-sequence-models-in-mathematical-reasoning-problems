    "message_2": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Add 7 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -7:\n4x - 7 + 7 = 11 + 7\n4x = 18\n\n2. Now, divide both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate x:\n4x / 4 = 18 / 4\nx = 4.5\n\nSo, the solution is x = 4.5."
