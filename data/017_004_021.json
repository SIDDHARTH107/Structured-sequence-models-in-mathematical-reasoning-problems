By the Sylow theorems, the number of 7-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_7, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_7 divides the index [G : P], where P is a 7-Sylow subgroup, so n_7 divides 49/7 = 7.\n2. n_7 is congruent to 1 modulo 7, so n_7 = 1 + 7k for some integer k.\n\nFrom these conditions, we have two possibilities for n_7: either n_7 = 1 or n_7 = 7.\n\nCase 1: n_7 = 1\nIn this case, there is only one 7-Sylow subgroup, which we denote by P. By the Sylow theorems, P is normal in G. Since |P| = 7, P is a cyclic group of order 7 (generated by an element of order 7). Since G has only one proper nontrivial subgroup (P), G must be a cyclic group generated by an element of order 49. Thus, G is cyclic in this case.\n\nCase 2: n_7 = 7\nIn this case, there are 7 distinct 7-Sylow subgroups in G. Let P and Q be two distinct 7-Sylow subgroups. Since |P| = |Q| = 7, both P and Q are cyclic groups of order 7. Note that the intersection of P and Q is trivial, i.e., P ∩ Q = {e}, where e is the identity element of G.\n\nNow, consider the set PQ = {pq | p ∈ P, q ∈ Q}. We claim that |PQ| = 49. To see this, note that for each p ∈ P, the map φ_p: Q → PQ given by φ_p(q) = pq is injective. Indeed, if φ_p(q_1) = φ_p(q_2), then pq_1 = pq_2, which implies that q_1 = q_2. Thus, there are 7 distinct elements of the form pq for each p ∈ P. Since there are 7 elements in P, we have a total of 7 * 7 = 49 elements in PQ.\n\nSince |PQ| = |G|, we have that PQ = G. Moreover, since P and Q are normal in G (by the Sylow theorems), we can form the direct product P × Q, which is a group of order 49. The map ψ: P × Q → G given by ψ(p, q) = pq is a well-defined isomorphism, as it is bijective (by the above argument) and respects the group operation. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7 in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 7."
