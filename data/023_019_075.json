    "message_2": "To find the output of the system using Fourier transform analysis, we first need to find the Fourier transforms of the input x(t) and the impulse response h(t). Then, we will multiply these Fourier transforms and take the inverse Fourier transform of the result to obtain the output y(t).\n\n1. Find the Fourier transform of h(t):\n\nh(t) = e^(-2t)u(t)\n\nH(jω) = ∫[e^(-2t)u(t)e^(-jωt)] dt (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nSince u(t) is the unit step function, the integral starts from 0:\n\nH(jω) = ∫[e^(-2t)e^(-jωt)] dt (from 0 to ∞)\n\nNow, combine the exponentials:\n\nH(jω) = ∫[e^((-2-jω)t)] dt (from 0 to ∞)\n\nIntegrate with respect to t:\n\nH(jω) = [-1/(2+jω)e^((-2-jω)t)] (from 0 to ∞)\n\nEvaluate the limits:\n\nH(jω) = (-1/(2+jω)e^(-∞)) - (-1/(2+jω)e^(0))\n\nH(jω) = 0 - (-1/(2+jω))\n\nH(jω) = 1/(2+jω)\n\n2. Find the Fourier transform of x(t):\n\nx(t) = 4sin(3t)u(t)\n\nX(jω) = ∫[4sin(3t)u(t)e^(-jωt)] dt (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nSince u(t) is the unit step function, the integral starts from 0:\n\nX(jω) = ∫[4sin(3t)e^(-jωt)] dt (from 0 to ∞)\n\nNow, use the Euler's identity sin(3t) = (e^(j3t) - e^(-j3t))/(2j):\n\nX(jω) = 2∫[(e^(j3t) - e^(-j3t))e^(-jωt)] dt (from 0 to ∞)\n\nSeparate the integrals:\n\nX(jω) = 2[∫(e^(j(3-ω)t) - e^(j(-3-ω)t)) dt (from 0 to ∞)]\n\nIntegrate with respect to t:\n\nX(jω) = 2[(1/(j(3-ω))e^(j(3-ω)t) - 1/(j(-3-ω))e^(j(-3-ω)t)) (from 0 to ∞)]\n\nEvaluate the limits:\n\nX(jω) = 2[(1/(j(3-ω)) - 1/(j(-3-ω)))]\n\n3. Multiply H(jω) and X(jω):\n\nY(jω) = H(jω)X(jω)\n\nY(jω) = (1/(2+jω)) * 2[(1/(j(3-ω)) - 1/(j(-3-ω)))]\n\nY(jω) = [(1/(j(3-ω)) - 1/(j(-3-ω)))]/(1/2+jω/2)\n\n4. Take the inverse Fourier transform of Y(jω) to obtain y(t):\n\ny(t) = 2π * ∫[Y(jω)e^(jωt) dω] (from -∞ to ∞)\n\ny(t) = 2π * ∫[[(1/(j(3-ω)) - 1/(j(-3-ω)))]/(1/2+jω/2) * e^(jωt) dω] (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nThe inverse Fourier transform of Y(jω) is difficult to compute analytically. However, you can use numerical methods or software tools like MATLAB or Mathematica to compute the inverse Fourier transform and obtain the output y(t)."
