    "message_2": "To solve the Schrödinger equation for the harmonic oscillator with the given parameters, we first need to write down the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a harmonic oscillator:\n\n(-ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) + (1/2) * m * ω^2 * x^2 * ψ(x) = E * ψ(x)\n\nGiven the mass m = 1 and angular frequency ω = 2, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n(-ħ^2 / 2) * (d^2ψ(x) / dx^2) + 2 * x^2 * ψ(x) = E * ψ(x)\n\nNow, we need to solve this differential equation. The general solution to this equation involves Hermite polynomials and Gaussian functions. The energy eigenvalues for a harmonic oscillator are given by:\n\nE_n = (n + 1/2) * ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are given by:\n\nψ_n(x) = (1 / sqrt(2^n * n! * sqrt(π) * a)) * H_n(x/a) * exp(-x^2 / (2a^2))\n\nwhere a = sqrt(ħ / (mω)) and H_n(x) are the Hermite polynomials.\n\nHowever, the initial conditions given are ψ(x,0) = 0 and ψ'(x,0) = 1, which do not correspond to any of the energy eigenstates. To satisfy these initial conditions, we need to construct a linear combination of the eigenfunctions:\n\nψ(x,t) = Σ c_n * ψ_n(x) * exp(-i * E_n * t / ħ)\n\nTo find the coefficients c_n, we need to use the initial conditions. Since ψ(x,0) = 0, we have:\n\n0 = Σ c_n * ψ_n(x)\n\nThis condition cannot be satisfied by any linear combination of the eigenfunctions, as the eigenfunctions are orthogonal and non-zero.\n\nSimilarly, the condition ψ'(x,0) = 1 also cannot be satisfied by any linear combination of the eigenfunctions, as the derivatives of the eigenfunctions are not constant.\n\nThus, the given initial conditions are not compatible with the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions, and the problem cannot be solved using the standard approach."
