    "message_2": "To find the closed-form expression for the given recurrence relation, we first need to find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for the given recurrence relation is:\n\n$r^2 - 5r + 6 = 0$\n\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as:\n\n$(r - 2)(r - 3) = 0$\n\nThe solutions to this equation are r = 2 and r = 3. Since we have two distinct roots, the general solution for the recurrence relation is:\n\n$a_n = A(2^n) + B(3^n)$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of A and B using the initial conditions:\n\nFor $a_0 = 1$:\n\n$1 = A(2^0) + B(3^0)$\n$1 = A + B$\n\nFor $a_1 = 2$:\n\n$2 = A(2^1) + B(3^1)$\n$2 = 2A + 3B$\n\nNow, we can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of A and B. From the first equation, we have:\n\n$B = 1 - A$\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\n$2 = 2A + 3(1 - A)$\n$2 = 2A + 3 - 3A$\n$2 - 3 = -A$\n$A = 1$\n\nNow, substituting the value of A back into the equation for B:\n\n$B = 1 - 1 = 0$\n\nSo, the closed-form expression for $a_n$ is:\n\n$a_n = 1(2^n) + 0(3^n)$\n$a_n = 2^n$"
