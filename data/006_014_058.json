    "message_1": "In a particular manufacturing process, the probability of a technological failure occurring in a component is 0.05. If the system consists of 100 such components, what is the probability that at least 4 components will fail in the process?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (failures in this case) in n trials (components)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (failure in this case) for each trial (component)\n- n is the number of trials (components)\n- k is the number of successes (failures in this case)\n\nWe want to find the probability that at least 4 components will fail, which means we need to find the probability of 4, 5, 6, ..., 100 failures. Instead of calculating each of these probabilities separately and summing them, it's easier to find the probability of 0, 1, 2, and 3 failures and subtract that from 1.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, and 3 failures:\n\nP(X = 0) = C(100, 0) * 0.05^0 * (1-0.05)^(100-0)\nP(X = 1) = C(100, 1) * 0.05^1 * (1-0.05)^(100-1)\nP(X = 2) = C(100, 2) * 0.05^2 * (1-0.05)^(100-2)\nP(X = 3) = C(100, 3) * 0.05^3 * (1-0.05)^(100-3)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of at least 4 failures:\n\nP(X >= 4) = 1 - (P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3))\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\nP(X = 0) ≈ 0.00592\nP(X = 1) ≈ 0.03116\nP(X = 2) ≈ 0.08118\nP(X = 3) ≈ 0.13981\n\nP(X >= 4) ≈ 1 - (0.00592 + 0.03116 + 0.08118 + 0.13981) ≈ 1 - 0.25807 ≈ 0.74193\n\nSo, the probability that at least 4 components will fail in the process is approximately 0.74193 or 74.19%."
