    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point $(1,1,\\sqrt{2})$, we first need to find the gradient of the surface at that point. The gradient is given by the partial derivatives of the surface equation with respect to each variable.\n\nThe surface equation is $F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 4 = 0$. We will find the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2x$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = 2y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z} = 2z$\n\nNow, we will evaluate these partial derivatives at the point $(1,1,\\sqrt{2})$:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}(1,1,\\sqrt{2}) = 2(1) = 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}(1,1,\\sqrt{2}) = 2(1) = 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial z}(1,1,\\sqrt{2}) = 2(\\sqrt{2}) = 2\\sqrt{2}$\n\nThe gradient of the surface at the point $(1,1,\\sqrt{2})$ is given by the vector $\\nabla F(1,1,\\sqrt{2}) = (2, 2, 2\\sqrt{2})$. This gradient vector is normal to the tangent plane at the point $(1,1,\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the point-normal form:\n\n$(x - x_0, y - y_0, z - z_0) \\cdot (2, 2, 2\\sqrt{2}) = 0$\n\nSubstituting the point $(1,1,\\sqrt{2})$:\n\n$(x - 1, y - 1, z - \\sqrt{2}) \\cdot (2, 2, 2\\sqrt{2}) = 0$\n\nExpanding the dot product:\n\n$2(x - 1) + 2(y - 1) + 2\\sqrt{2}(z - \\sqrt{2}) = 0$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$2x - 2 + 2y - 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}z - 4 = 0$\n\nFinally, the equation of the tangent plane is:\n\n$2x + 2y + 2\\sqrt{2}z - 8 = 0$"
