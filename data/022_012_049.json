    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem a student can solve:\n\nLet f(z) = (z-3)/(z+1) be a meromorphic function. Find the singularities of the function and classify each one as a pole or a removable singularity. Also, find the residue of f at each pole.\n\nHint: A singularity of a function is a point where it is not defined or is not continuous. A pole is a type of singularity where the function's absolute value tends to infinity as z approaches the singularity. A removable singularity is a type of singularity where the function can be extended to be continuous at the singularity.",
    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z-3)/(z+1), we need to find the values of z for which the function is not defined. The function will be undefined when the denominator is equal to zero. So, we need to solve the equation:\n\nz + 1 = 0\n\nz = -1\n\nSo, there is one singularity at z = -1.\n\nNow, we need to classify this singularity as a pole or a removable singularity. Since the numerator (z-3) does not have a zero at z = -1, the singularity is a pole. In this case, it is a simple pole because the denominator has a linear factor (z+1).\n\nNext, we need to find the residue of f at the pole z = -1. To do this, we can use the formula for the residue of a simple pole:\n\nRes(f, -1) = lim (z -> -1) [(z - (-1))(z-3)/(z+1)]\n\nRes(f, -1) = lim (z -> -1) [(z + 1)(z-3)/(z+1)]\n\nSince the (z+1) term in the numerator and denominator cancel out, we are left with:\n\nRes(f, -1) = lim (z -> -1) (z-3)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the limit as z approaches -1:\n\nRes(f, -1) = (-1) - 3 = -4\n\nSo, the residue of f at the pole z = -1 is -4."
