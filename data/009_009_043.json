    "message_2": "To find the energy levels of a particle confined in a one-dimensional box, we can use the formula for the energy levels of a particle in a box:\n\nE_n = (n^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)\n\nwhere E_n is the energy of the nth level, n is the energy level (1, 2, 3, ...), h is the Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), m is the mass of the particle, and L is the width of the box.\n\nGiven the width of the box L = 2.0 nm = 2.0 x 10^-9 m and the mass of the particle m = 9.11 x 10^-31 kg, we can find the first two energy levels (n = 1 and n = 2).\n\nFor n = 1:\nE_1 = (1^2 * (6.626 x 10^-34)^2) / (8 * 9.11 x 10^-31 * (2.0 x 10^-9)^2)\nE_1 = (6.626 x 10^-34)^2 / (8 * 9.11 x 10^-31 * 4.0 x 10^-18)\nE_1 ≈ 6.024 x 10^-19 J\n\nFor n = 2:\nE_2 = (2^2 * (6.626 x 10^-34)^2) / (8 * 9.11 x 10^-31 * (2.0 x 10^-9)^2)\nE_2 = 4 * (6.626 x 10^-34)^2 / (8 * 9.11 x 10^-31 * 4.0 x 10^-18)\nE_2 ≈ 24.096 x 10^-19 J\n\nSo, the first two energy levels of the particle are approximately 6.024 x 10^-19 J and 24.096 x 10^-19 J."
