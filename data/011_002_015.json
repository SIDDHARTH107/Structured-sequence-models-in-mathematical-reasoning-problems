    "message_2": "The binomial coefficient, also known as \"n choose k\" or C(n, k), can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n! denotes the factorial of n.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and k = 3, so we have:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the factorials:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6\n(10-3)! = 7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5,040\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nC(10, 3) = 3,628,800 / (6 × 5,040) = 3,628,800 / 30,240 = 120\n\nSo, the value of the binomial coefficient C(10, 3) is 120."
