    "message_2": "The forced van der Pol oscillator is described by the following differential equation:\n\nx''(t) - μ(1 - x^2(t))x'(t) + x(t) = F0 * cos(ωt)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement, x'(t) is the velocity, x''(t) is the acceleration, μ is the damping parameter, F0 is the amplitude of the forcing function, and ω is the forcing frequency.\n\nWe are given the values of the damping parameter μ = 1/2 and the forcing frequency ω = 2π. To find the maximum amplitude reached by the oscillator, we need to find the amplitude of the steady-state response.\n\nThe steady-state response of a forced van der Pol oscillator can be approximated by the following equation:\n\nX = F0 / sqrt((k - mω^2)^2 + (cω)^2)\n\nwhere X is the amplitude of the steady-state response, k is the stiffness of the oscillator, m is the mass of the oscillator, and c is the damping coefficient.\n\nFor a van der Pol oscillator, the stiffness k = 1, the mass m = 1, and the damping coefficient c = μ(1 - x^2(t)). Since we are looking for the maximum amplitude, we can assume that x^2(t) is at its maximum value, which is 1. Therefore, c = μ(1 - 1) = 0.\n\nNow we can plug in the given values and solve for X:\n\nX = F0 / sqrt((1 - 1(2π)^2)^2 + (0 * 2π)^2)\n\nX = F0 / sqrt((-4π^2)^2)\n\nX = F0 / (4π^2)\n\nThe maximum amplitude reached by the forced van der Pol oscillator depends on the amplitude of the forcing function F0. The relationship between the maximum amplitude X and the forcing amplitude F0 is given by:\n\nX = F0 / (4π^2)"
