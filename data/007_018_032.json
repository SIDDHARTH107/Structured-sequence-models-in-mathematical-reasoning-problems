    "message_2": "The smallest prime gap between two consecutive prime numbers greater than 200 is 2. The prime numbers are 211 and 213. However, 213 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3 and 71. The correct pair of consecutive prime numbers greater than 200 with the smallest gap is 223 and 227, with a gap of 4."
