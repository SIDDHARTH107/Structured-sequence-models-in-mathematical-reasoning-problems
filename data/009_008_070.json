Determine the solution $u(x,t)$ at time $t=0.5$ and position $x=\\frac{1}{4}$.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume the solution has the form:\n\n$$u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$$\n\nSubstitute this into the wave equation:\n\n$$X(x)T''(t) = c^2 X''(x)T(t)$$\n\nNow, divide both sides by $c^2 X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call $-\\lambda^2$:\n\n$$\\frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda^2$$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$X''(x) + \\lambda^2 X(x) = 0$$\n$$T''(t) + c^2 \\lambda^2 T(t) = 0$$\n\nSolve the first equation for $X(x)$:\n\n$$X(x) = A\\cos(\\lambda x) + B\\sin(\\lambda x)$$\n\nApply the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(l,t) = 0$:\n\n$$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$$\n$$X(l) = A\\cos(\\lambda l) + B\\sin(\\lambda l) = B\\sin(\\lambda l) = 0$$\n\nSince $B$ cannot be zero (otherwise the solution would be trivial), we must have $\\sin(\\lambda l) = 0$. This implies that $\\lambda l = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. Thus, $\\lambda = n\\pi/l = n\\pi$ since $l=1$. So, the solution for $X(x)$ is:\n\n$$X(x) = B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nNow, solve the second equation for $T(t)$:\n\n$$T''(t) + 4\\pi^2 n^2 T(t) = 0$$\n\nThe general solution for this equation is:\n\n$$T(t) = C_n\\cos(2\\pi n t) + D_n\\sin(2\\pi n t)$$\n\nNow, apply the initial condition $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = X(x)T'(0) = B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)(-2\\pi n C_n\\sin(0) + 2\\pi n D_n\\cos(0)) = 2\\pi n B_n D_n\\sin(n\\pi x) = 0$$\n\nSince we don't want a trivial solution, we must have $D_n = 0$. Thus, the solution for $T(t)$ is:\n\n$$T(t) = C_n\\cos(2\\pi n t)$$\n\nNow, the general solution for the wave equation is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)\\cos(2\\pi n t)$$\n\nApply the initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(4\\pi x)$:\n\n$$\\sin(4\\pi x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n B_n\\sin(n\\pi x)$$\n\nComparing the two sides, we see that $C_n B_n = 0$ for $n \\neq 4$ and $C_4 B_4 = 1$. We can choose $C_4 = 1$ and $B_4 = 1$. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n$$u(x,t) = \\sin(4\\pi x)\\cos(8\\pi t)$$\n\nFinally, we can find the solution at $t=0.5$ and $x=\\frac{1}{4}$:\n\n$$u\\left(\\frac{1}{4}, 0.5\\right) = \\sin\\left(4\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\cos\\left(8\\pi \\cdot 0.5\\right) = \\sin(\\pi)\\cos(4\\pi) = 0$$"
