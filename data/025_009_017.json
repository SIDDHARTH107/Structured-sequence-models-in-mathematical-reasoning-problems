    "message_2": "The dimension of the tangent space to the moduli space of smooth algebraic curves $M_g$ at a curve $C$ of genus $g$ can be computed using the Riemann-Roch theorem. \n\nFor a curve $C$ of genus $g$, the dimension of the space of holomorphic differentials (also known as the space of abelian differentials) is equal to the genus $g$. These holomorphic differentials can be thought of as infinitesimal deformations of the curve $C$. \n\nHowever, not all of these deformations are distinct, as some of them correspond to the action of the mapping class group (i.e., the group of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving self-homeomorphisms of the curve). To account for this, we need to subtract the dimension of the space of infinitesimal automorphisms of the curve $C$.\n\nFor a curve of genus $g \\geq 2$, the space of infinitesimal automorphisms is 3-dimensional, corresponding to the infinitesimal action of the MÃ¶bius transformations (i.e., the group of orientation-preserving conformal self-maps of the Riemann sphere). \n\nThus, the dimension of the tangent space to $M_g$ at a curve $C$ of genus $g$ is given by:\n\ndim(T_C M_g) = g - 3\n\nIn our case, $g = 4$, so the dimension of the tangent space to $M_4$ at $C$ is:\n\ndim(T_C M_4) = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the tangent space to $M_4$ at $C$ is 1."
