    "message_2": "To find the cross product of two vectors A and B using trigonometry, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the magnitudes of the vectors A and B.\n2. Find the angle θ between the vectors A and B.\n3. Calculate the cross product magnitude.\n4. Find the direction of the cross product.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. Magnitudes of A and B:\n‖A‖ = √(6² + (-3)² + 2²) = √(36 + 9 + 4) = √49 = 7\n‖B‖ = √(4² + (-1)² + 5²) = √(16 + 1 + 25) = √42\n\n2. Angle θ between A and B:\nTo find the angle between A and B, we can use the dot product formula:\nA · B = ‖A‖‖B‖cos(θ)\nθ = arccos((A · B) / (‖A‖‖B‖))\n\nFirst, calculate the dot product A · B:\nA · B = (6 * 4) + (-3 * -1) + (2 * 5) = 24 + 3 + 10 = 37\n\nNow, find the angle θ:\nθ = arccos(37 / (7 * √42)) ≈ 0.507 radians\n\n3. Cross product magnitude:\n‖A x B‖ = ‖A‖‖B‖sin(θ)\n‖A x B‖ = 7 * √42 * sin(0.507) ≈ 18.97\n\n4. Direction of the cross product:\nTo find the direction of the cross product, we can use the formula:\nA x B = (AyBz - AzBy, AzBx - AxBz, AxBy - AyBx)\n\nA x B = ((-3)(5) - (2)(-1), (2)(4) - (6)(5), (6)(-1) - (-3)(4))\nA x B = (-15 + 2, 8 - 30, -6 + 12)\nA x B = (-13, -22, 6)\n\nSo, the cross product of the vectors A and B is A x B = (-13, -22, 6)."
