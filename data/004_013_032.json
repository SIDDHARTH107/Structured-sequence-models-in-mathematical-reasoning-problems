    "message_1": "A cable of 20 feet is to be cut into two pieces. One piece will be used to make a square and the other piece will be used to make a rectangle with length twice its width. \na) What should be the dimensions of the square and rectangle in order to maximize the total area?\nb) What is the maximum area?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the length of the cable used to make the square, and let y be the length of the cable used to make the rectangle. We know that x + y = 20.\n\nThe perimeter of the square is x, so the side length of the square is x/4. The area of the square is then (x/4)^2 = x^2/16.\n\nFor the rectangle, let the width be w and the length be 2w. The perimeter of the rectangle is y, so 2w + 4w = y, which means 6w = y. Therefore, w = y/6 and the length is 2(y/6) = y/3. The area of the rectangle is w * (2w) = (y/6) * (y/3) = y^2/18.\n\nThe total area of the square and rectangle is A = x^2/16 + y^2/18. We want to maximize this area given the constraint x + y = 20.\n\nUsing the constraint, we can solve for y in terms of x: y = 20 - x. Now, substitute this expression for y in the area function:\n\nA(x) = x^2/16 + (20 - x)^2/18\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A(x) with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nA'(x) = (2x/16) - (2(20 - x)/18) = x/8 - (20 - x)/9\n\nSetting A'(x) = 0 and solving for x:\n\nx/8 - (20 - x)/9 = 0\n9x - 8(20 - x) = 0\n9x - 160 + 8x = 0\n17x = 160\nx = 160/17 ≈ 9.41\n\nNow, we can find y:\n\ny = 20 - x ≈ 20 - 9.41 ≈ 10.59\n\nSo, the dimensions of the square are approximately 9.41/4 ≈ 2.35 feet per side, and the dimensions of the rectangle are approximately 10.59/6 ≈ 1.76 feet for the width and 10.59/3 ≈ 3.53 feet for the length.\n\nNow, we can find the maximum area:\n\nA_max = x^2/16 + y^2/18 ≈ (9.41^2)/16 + (10.59^2)/18 ≈ 27.64\n\nThe maximum area is approximately 27.64 square feet."
