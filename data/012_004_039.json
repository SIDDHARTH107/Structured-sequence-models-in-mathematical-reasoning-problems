    "message_2": "To find the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty graph to build the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the edges to the minimum spanning tree in the sorted order, making sure that adding the edge does not form a cycle.\n\nSorted edges by weight: (e-f, 2), (b-e, 1), (c-d, 1), (a-e, 3), (a-b, 4), (b-c, 5), (a-f, 5), (e-d, 5), (c-f, 6)\n\nNow, let's add the edges one by one:\n\n1. Add edge (e-f, 2) to the minimum spanning tree.\n2. Add edge (b-e, 1) to the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add edge (c-d, 1) to the minimum spanning tree.\n4. Add edge (a-e, 3) to the minimum spanning tree. Adding this edge does not form a cycle.\n5. Skip edge (a-b, 4) since adding it would form a cycle (a-b-e-a).\n6. Skip edge (b-c, 5) since adding it would form a cycle (b-e-c-d-b).\n7. Skip edge (a-f, 5) since adding it would form a cycle (a-e-f-a).\n8. Skip edge (e-d, 5) since adding it would form a cycle (e-b-c-d-e).\n9. Skip edge (c-f, 6) since adding it would form a cycle (c-d-e-f-c).\n\nThe minimum spanning tree is now complete and consists of the following edges:\n\n```\n    3\n 𝑎──────𝑒\n |     /  |\n |  1 /   |\n |  / \\   |1\n 𝑏──────𝑐\n       /  |\n    1 /   |\n    / \\   |2\n 𝑓──────𝑑\n```\n\nEdges in the minimum spanning tree: (e-f, 2), (b-e, 1), (c-d, 1), (a-e, 3)\n\nTotal weight of the minimum spanning tree: 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 7"
