    "message_2": "To find the minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 1 subject to the constraint x + y >= 5, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nLet g(x, y) = x + y - 5, then the constraint can be written as g(x, y) >= 0.\n\nNow, we form the Lagrangian function L(x, y, λ) = f(x) + λg(x, y) = 2x^2 - 4x + 1 + λ(x + y - 5).\n\nTo find the minimum value, we need to find the gradient of L and set it to zero:\n\n∇L = (∂L/∂x, ∂L/∂y, ∂L/∂λ) = (4x - 4 + λ, λ - 1, x + y - 5).\n\nSetting the gradient to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n1) 4x - 4 + λ = 0\n2) λ - 1 = 0\n3) x + y - 5 = 0\n\nFrom equation (2), we get λ = 1. Substituting this into equation (1), we get:\n\n4x - 4 + 1 = 0\n4x = 3\nx = 3/4\n\nNow, substituting the value of x into equation (3), we get:\n\n3/4 + y - 5 = 0\ny = 5 - 3/4\ny = 17/4\n\nSo, the values of x and y that minimize the function while satisfying the constraint are x = 3/4 and y = 17/4.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the function f(x) at these points:\n\nf(3/4) = 2(3/4)^2 - 4(3/4) + 1 = 2(9/16) - 3 + 1 = 9/8 - 2 = 1/8\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the quadratic function f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 1 subject to the constraint x + y >= 5 is 1/8."
