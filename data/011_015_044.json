    "message_2": "Let's use the Pigeonhole Principle to solve this problem. We need to find the minimum number of handshakes to guarantee either a group of 3 people who have all shaken hands with each other or a group of 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other.\n\nConsider a single person in the group. There are 5 other people they can shake hands with or not shake hands with. Let's divide these 5 people into two groups: those who have shaken hands with the person (Group A) and those who have not (Group B).\n\nNow, if either Group A or Group B has 3 or more people, we are done. This is because if Group A has 3 people, then those 3 people have all shaken hands with the person, and if Group B has 3 people, then those 3 people have not shaken hands with the person.\n\nSo, let's assume that neither Group A nor Group B has 3 or more people. This means that Group A has 2 people and Group B has 3 people. In this case, the person has shaken hands with 2 people and not shaken hands with 3 people.\n\nNow, let's consider the 3 people in Group B. If any pair of them have shaken hands with each other, then we have a group of 3 people who have all shaken hands with each other (the person and the pair from Group B). If none of the pairs in Group B have shaken hands with each other, then we have a group of 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other (Group B).\n\nThus, in the worst-case scenario, we need 3 handshakes (the person shaking hands with 2 people in Group A) to guarantee either a group of 3 people who have all shaken hands with each other or a group of 3 people who have not shaken hands with each other."
