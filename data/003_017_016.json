    "message_2": "To find the average temperature, we need to first find the equation of the sine curve that represents the temperature. Let T(t) be the temperature at time t (in hours), where t ranges from 0 to 24.\n\nSince the maximum temperature is 32°C and the minimum temperature is 20°C, the amplitude of the sine curve is (32 - 20)/2 = 6°C. The average temperature is the vertical shift of the sine curve, which is (32 + 20)/2 = 26°C.\n\nThe sine curve has a period of 24 hours, so the angular frequency (ω) is 2π/24.\n\nNow we can write the equation for the temperature as a function of time:\n\nT(t) = 6 * sin(ωt + φ) + 26\n\nWe don't know the phase shift (φ) yet, but since we're looking for the average temperature, it won't affect the result.\n\nTo find the average temperature, we need to integrate T(t) over one period (24 hours) and divide by the length of the period:\n\nAverage temperature = (1/24) * ∫[6 * sin(ωt + φ) + 26] dt from 0 to 24\n\nSince the integral of sin(ωt + φ) over one period is 0, the average temperature is:\n\nAverage temperature = (1/24) * ∫26 dt from 0 to 24\n= (1/24) * [26t] from 0 to 24\n= (1/24) * (26 * 24 - 26 * 0)\n= 26\n\nSo, the average temperature during the day is 26°C."
