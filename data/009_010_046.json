    "message_1": "A stock is currently priced at $100 per share. The annualized volatility of the stock price is 20%, and the risk-free interest rate is 3% per annum. Use the Black-Scholes equation to find the fair price of a European call option with a strike price of $110, expiring in 90 days.",
    "message_2": "To find the fair price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes equation, we need to use the following formula:\n\nCall option price = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\n\nwhere:\nS = current stock price = $100\nX = strike price = $110\nr = risk-free interest rate = 0.03 (3% per annum)\nT = time to expiration (in years) = 90 days / 365 days = 0.246575\nN(d) = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\ne = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(S/X) + (r + (σ^2)/2) * T) / (σ * √T)\nd2 = d1 - σ * √T\n\nwhere:\nln = natural logarithm\nσ = annualized volatility = 0.20 (20%)\n\nNow, let's calculate d1 and d2:\n\nd1 = (ln(100/110) + (0.03 + (0.20^2)/2) * 0.246575) / (0.20 * √0.246575)\nd1 = (-0.09531 + (0.03 + 0.02) * 0.246575) / (0.20 * 0.496558)\nd1 = (-0.09531 + 0.01232) / 0.099312\nd1 = -0.08299 / 0.099312\nd1 ≈ -0.836\n\nd2 = d1 - σ * √T\nd2 = -0.836 - 0.20 * √0.246575\nd2 ≈ -0.836 - 0.099312\nd2 ≈ -0.935\n\nNow, we need to find N(d1) and N(d2). These values can be found using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator with a built-in cumulative distribution function. For this example, we will use the following approximate values:\n\nN(-0.836) ≈ 0.202\nN(-0.935) ≈ 0.175\n\nFinally, let's calculate the call option price:\n\nCall option price = S * N(d1) - X * e^(-rT) * N(d2)\nCall option price = 100 * 0.202 - 110 * e^(-0.03 * 0.246575) * 0.175\nCall option price = 20.2 - 110 * 0.9927 * 0.175\nCall option price = 20.2 - 110 * 0.1738\nCall option price = 20.2 - 19.118\nCall option price ≈ $1.082\n\nThus, the fair price of the European call option with a strike price of $110, expiring in 90 days, is approximately $1.082."
