    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. In other words, it is the union of the sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nFirst, let's find the union of A and B (A ∪ B):\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 3, 5, 7} ∪ {3, 6, 9} = {1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 9}\n\nNext, let's find the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B):\n\nA ∩ B = {1, 3, 5, 7} ∩ {3, 6, 9} = {3}\n\nNow, we can find the symmetric difference of A and B (A Δ B):\n\nA Δ B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 9} - {3} = {1, 5, 7, 6, 9}\n\nNow let's show that the symmetric difference is commutative. This means that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nThe union and intersection of sets are commutative, so:\n\nB ∪ A = A ∪ B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 9}\nB ∩ A = A ∩ B = {3}\n\nNow we can find the symmetric difference of B and A (B Δ A):\n\nB Δ A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 9} - {3} = {1, 5, 7, 6, 9}\n\nAs we can see, A Δ B = {1, 5, 7, 6, 9} and B Δ A = {1, 5, 7, 6, 9}, which means the symmetric difference is commutative."
