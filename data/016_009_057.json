    "message_2": "The self-similarity dimension (D) of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nD = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Dragon curve, after each iteration, the number of segments (N) doubles, and the scaling factor (s) is the square root of 2.\n\nAfter 8 iterations, the number of segments will be N = 2^8 = 256.\n\nNow, we can calculate the self-similarity dimension:\n\nD = log(256) / log(√2) ≈ 8 / 0.5 = 16\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the self-similarity dimension is not an integer value for most fractals, and the Dragon curve is no exception. The value calculated above is an approximation based on the number of iterations and scaling factor. The true self-similarity dimension of the Dragon curve is approximately 1.5236."
