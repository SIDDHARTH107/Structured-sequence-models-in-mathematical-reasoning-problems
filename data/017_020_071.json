    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 40, we first need to analyze the possible structures of groups of order 40. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. Using the Sylow theorems, we can determine the possible structures of Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor the Sylow 2-subgroups, there are two possibilities: either there is one Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 (which we denote as n_2 = 1) or there are five Sylow 2-subgroups of order 8 (n_2 = 5). For the Sylow 5-subgroups, there is only one possibility: there is one Sylow 5-subgroup of order 5 (n_5 = 1).\n\nNow, we can analyze the possible structures of the groups:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_5 = 1, then the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are both normal. In this case, the group is isomorphic to either C_8 × C_5 or D_8 × C_5, where C_n denotes the cyclic group of order n and D_n denotes the dihedral group of order 2n. Both of these groups are abelian, so we don't consider them further.\n\n2. If n_2 = 5 and n_5 = 1, then the group has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup, but its Sylow 2-subgroups are not normal. In this case, we can use the semidirect product to construct non-abelian groups. The automorphism group of the Sylow 5-subgroup, Aut(C_5), is isomorphic to C_4. There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from the Sylow 2-subgroup (which is either C_8 or D_8) to Aut(C_5): one of order 2 and one of order 4.\n\nIf the Sylow 2-subgroup is C_8, then there are two non-abelian semidirect products: one corresponding to the homomorphism of order 2 and one corresponding to the homomorphism of order 4. These two groups are not isomorphic to each other.\n\nIf the Sylow 2-subgroup is D_8, then there is only one non-abelian semidirect product, corresponding to the homomorphism of order 2. The homomorphism of order 4 does not yield a non-abelian group in this case.\n\nIn total, there are three non-abelian groups of order 40, and their isomorphism classes are as follows:\n\n1. The semidirect product of C_8 and C_5 corresponding to the homomorphism of order 2.\n2. The semidirect product of C_8 and C_5 corresponding to the homomorphism of order 4.\n3. The semidirect product of D_8 and C_5 corresponding to the homomorphism of order 2."
