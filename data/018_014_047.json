    "message_1": "Given two sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 4}, find the Cartesian product of the two sets, and then find the complement of the resulting set. Finally, show that the Cartesian product of the complement of A and the complement of B is not equal to the complement of the Cartesian product of A and B.",
    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product of the two sets A and B. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.\n\nA × B = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\n\nNow, let's find the complement of the resulting set. The complement of a set is the set of all elements that are not in the original set. To find the complement of the Cartesian product A × B, we need to know the universal set. Since it is not given, we cannot find the complement of A × B.\n\nNext, let's find the complement of A and the complement of B. The complement of a set is the set of all elements that are not in the original set. Again, we need to know the universal set to find the complement of A and B. Since it is not given, we cannot find the complement of A and B.\n\nAs we cannot find the complement of A × B and the Cartesian product of the complement of A and the complement of B without the universal set, we cannot show that they are not equal."
