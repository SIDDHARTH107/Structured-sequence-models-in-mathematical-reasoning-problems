    "message_1": "A math student is given a surface defined by the equation $z = 2x^2 + y^2$, and is asked to find the geodesic path between the points $(1,0,3)$ and $(0,1,4)$. What is the equation of the geodesic curve in terms of $t$?",
    "message_2": "To find the geodesic path between two points on a surface, we need to minimize the arc length between the points. Let's parameterize the curve on the surface as $\\mathbf{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$, where $t$ varies from $0$ to $1$ such that $\\mathbf{r}(0) = (1, 0, 3)$ and $\\mathbf{r}(1) = (0, 1, 4)$.\n\nThe arc length $L$ of the curve is given by:\n\n$$L = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{(\\frac{dx}{dt})^2 + (\\frac{dy}{dt})^2 + (\\frac{dz}{dt})^2} dt$$\n\nSince $z = 2x^2 + y^2$, we have $\\frac{dz}{dt} = 4x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt}$. Now, we need to find the curve that minimizes the arc length. This is a problem in the calculus of variations, and we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation to find the extremal curve.\n\nLet $F(x, y, x', y') = \\sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2 + (4x x' + 2y y')^2}$, where $x' = \\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $y' = \\frac{dy}{dt}$. The Euler-Lagrange equations for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} - \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x'} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = 0$$\n\nSolving these equations is quite involved and typically requires numerical methods. However, we can simplify the problem by assuming that the geodesic path lies in the plane containing the two points and the origin, i.e., $(1, 0, 3)$, $(0, 1, 4)$, and $(0, 0, 0)$. In this case, the geodesic path will be a straight line in the $xy$-plane, and we can parameterize it as:\n\n$$x(t) = 1 - t$$\n$$y(t) = t$$\n\nNow, we can find $z(t)$ using the surface equation:\n\n$$z(t) = 2x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = 2(1 - t)^2 + t^2 = 2 - 4t + 3t^2$$\n\nThus, the equation of the geodesic curve in terms of $t$ is:\n\n$$\\mathbf{r}(t) = (1 - t, t, 2 - 4t + 3t^2)$$"
