    "message_1": "A company can produce two products: Product A and Product B. The profit from each unit of Product A is $5 and from Product B is $7. Each product requires a certain amount of resources, and the company has a total of 500 units of resources available. The production of one unit of Product A requires 2 units of resources and the production of one unit of Product B requires 3 units of resources. What is the maximum profit the company can make by allocating the resources optimally between the productions of Product A and Product B?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of Product A produced and y be the number of units of Product B produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 7y, subject to the constraint that the total resources used do not exceed 500 units. The constraint can be written as 2x + 3y ≤ 500.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the method of integer linear programming. We will first find the feasible region for the production of Product A and Product B, and then find the maximum profit within this region.\n\nThe feasible region can be found by graphing the constraint 2x + 3y ≤ 500. The boundary line is given by 2x + 3y = 500. To find the intercepts, we can set x = 0 and y = 0:\n\nWhen x = 0: 2(0) + 3y = 500 => y = 500/3 ≈ 166.67\nWhen y = 0: 2x + 3(0) = 500 => x = 250\n\nSo, the boundary line passes through the points (0, 166.67) and (250, 0). Since we are looking for the region where 2x + 3y ≤ 500, the feasible region is the area below the line, including the line itself.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum profit within this feasible region. Since both x and y must be integers (as we cannot produce a fraction of a product), we can use integer linear programming to find the optimal solution.\n\nWe can start by checking the integer points along the boundary line and within the feasible region. The points with the highest profit will be our optimal solution.\n\nSome integer points close to the boundary line are (0, 166), (83, 111), (166, 56), and (250, 0). Let's calculate the profit for each of these points:\n\nP(0, 166) = 5(0) + 7(166) = 0 + 1162 = 1162\nP(83, 111) = 5(83) + 7(111) = 415 + 777 = 1192\nP(166, 56) = 5(166) + 7(56) = 830 + 392 = 1222\nP(250, 0) = 5(250) + 7(0) = 1250 + 0 = 1250\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 250 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B, resulting in a profit of $1250."
