    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for the student to solve:\n\nA company makes two products, X and Y. Each X product brings in a profit of $5 and requires 2 units of raw material, while each Y product brings in a profit of $4 and requires 3 units of raw material. The company has 100 units of raw material available. If the company wants to maximize their profit, how many of each product should they produce?\n\nHint: You can use quasi-Newton optimization methods to find the solution.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of X products and y be the number of Y products. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 4y, subject to the constraint that 2x + 3y ≤ 100 (due to the raw material limitation).\n\nWe can solve this problem using integer linear programming, as the products must be whole numbers. However, we can first get an idea of the solution by solving the linear programming problem without the integer constraint.\n\nThe constraint can be rewritten as y ≤ (100 - 2x) / 3. We can now find the critical points by setting the gradient of the profit function equal to zero:\n\n∇P(x, y) = (5, 4)\n\nSince the gradient is constant, there are no critical points within the feasible region. Therefore, the maximum must occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region. The vertices are (0, 0), (0, 33), and (50, 0).\n\nEvaluating the profit function at these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = 0\nP(0, 33) = 5(0) + 4(33) = 132\nP(50, 0) = 5(50) + 4(0) = 250\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when producing 50 units of X and 0 units of Y, with a profit of $250. However, this is the solution to the linear programming problem, not the integer linear programming problem.\n\nTo find the integer solution, we can check the nearby integer points:\n\nP(49, 1) = 5(49) + 4(1) = 249\nP(48, 2) = 5(48) + 4(2) = 248\n\nThe integer solution is still to produce 50 units of X and 0 units of Y, with a profit of $250."
