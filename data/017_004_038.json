    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 25. Since 25 = 5^2 and 5 is a prime number, we can apply the Sylow Theorems. In particular, we know that the number of 5-Sylow subgroups in G, denoted by n_5, satisfies:\n\n1. n_5 divides the index [G : P], where P is a 5-Sylow subgroup of G, and\n2. n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5.\n\nSince the order of G is 25, the index [G : P] is (25/5) = 5. Thus, n_5 divides 5, and the only divisors of 5 are 1 and 5. We also know that n_5 is congruent to 1 modulo 5, so the only possibility is that n_5 = 1. This means that there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup in G, which we will denote by P.\n\nSince P is the unique 5-Sylow subgroup of G, it must be normal in G (by Sylow's Theorem). The order of P is 5 (since it is a 5-Sylow subgroup), and since 5 is a prime number, P must be a cyclic group of order 5, generated by some element a with a^5 = e (the identity element of G).\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/P. Since the order of G is 25 and the order of P is 5, the order of G/P is (25/5) = 5. Since 5 is a prime number, G/P must be a cyclic group of order 5, generated by some coset bP with (bP)^5 = P.\n\nWe will now show that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nCase 1: G is cyclic.\nIf G is cyclic, then it is generated by a single element, say g, with g^25 = e. In this case, G is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 25, and we are done.\n\nCase 2: G is not cyclic.\nIf G is not cyclic, then no element in G has order 25. We will show that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nConsider the element ab, where a is a generator of P and b is a representative of the coset bP that generates G/P. We have (ab)^5 = a^5b^5 = ee = e, since a^5 = e and b^5 âˆˆ P (by the definition of G/P). Thus, the order of ab is at most 5. Since G is not cyclic, the order of ab cannot be 25, so it must be exactly 5.\n\nNow, consider the subgroup H generated by the elements a and ab. Since a and ab both have order 5, H is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5. We will show that H = G, which implies that G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nThe order of H is the least common multiple of the orders of a and ab, which is 5 * 5 = 25 (since a and ab have relatively prime orders). Since the order of H is equal to the order of G, we must have H = G. Therefore, G is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5.\n\nIn conclusion, a group of order 25 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5."
