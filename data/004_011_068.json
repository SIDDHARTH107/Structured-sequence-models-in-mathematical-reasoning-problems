    "message_1": "A ladder 15 feet long rests against a vertical wall. If the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of 2 feet per second, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 9 feet from the wall? (Use calculus to solve)",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and y be the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. We are given that the ladder is 15 feet long, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 15^2\n\nNow, we are given that dx/dt = 2 feet per second (the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall). We want to find dy/dt (the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall) when x = 9 feet.\n\nFirst, we'll differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:\n\nd(x^2)/dt + d(y^2)/dt = d(15^2)/dt\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can plug in the given information:\n\n2(9)(2) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nTo find y when x = 9, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n9^2 + y^2 = 15^2\n81 + y^2 = 225\ny^2 = 144\ny = 12\n\nNow, we can plug in y = 12 into the equation:\n\n2(9)(2) + 2(12)(dy/dt) = 0\n36 + 24(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for dy/dt:\n\n24(dy/dt) = -36\ndy/dt = -36/24\ndy/dt = -3/2\n\nSo, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of -3/2 feet per second (negative sign indicates downward direction) when the bottom of the ladder is 9 feet from the wall."
