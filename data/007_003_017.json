    "message_2": "We are given the following congruences:\n\n1) 17 ≡ 6 (mod m)\n2) 23 ≡ 12 (mod m)\n\nWe can rewrite these congruences as:\n\n1) 17 - 6 ≡ 0 (mod m) => 11 ≡ 0 (mod m)\n2) 23 - 12 ≡ 0 (mod m) => 11 ≡ 0 (mod m)\n\nSince both congruences are equivalent, we can conclude that m is a divisor of 11. The divisors of 11 are 1 and 11. However, m cannot be 1, as this would mean that all integers are congruent to each other, which is not the case in this problem. Therefore, the value of m is 11."
