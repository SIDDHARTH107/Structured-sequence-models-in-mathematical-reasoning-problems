    "message_1": "Sure, here's a numerical problem related to the chaotic behavior of the double pendulum in Chaos theory:\n\nA double pendulum has a length of 2 meters for the first pendulum and a length of 1 meter for the second pendulum. If the initial angles of the first and second pendulums are 30 degrees and 15 degrees respectively, and the gravitational acceleration is 9.8 m/s^2, find the maximum angle reached by the first pendulum after 10 seconds.",
    "message_2": "The double pendulum problem is a complex and chaotic system, which means that it is highly sensitive to initial conditions and cannot be solved analytically. Instead, we will use numerical methods to approximate the solution.\n\nWe will use the Runge-Kutta method to solve the system of differential equations that govern the motion of the double pendulum. The equations of motion for the double pendulum are as follows:\n\nθ1' = ω1\nω1' = (-g(2*m1+m2)*sin(θ1)-m2*g*sin(θ1-2*θ2)-2*sin(θ1-θ2)*m2*(ω2^2*L2+ω1^2*L1*cos(θ1-θ2)))/(L1*(2*m1+m2-m2*cos(2*θ1-2*θ2)))\nθ2' = ω2\nω2' = (2*sin(θ1-θ2)*(ω1^2*L1*(m1+m2)+g*(m1+m2)*cos(θ1)+ω2^2*L2*m2*cos(θ1-θ2)))/(L2*(2*m1+m2-m2*cos(2*θ1-2*θ2)))\n\nWhere θ1 and θ2 are the angles of the first and second pendulums, ω1 and ω2 are their angular velocities, L1 and L2 are the lengths of the pendulums, m1 and m2 are their masses, and g is the gravitational acceleration.\n\nLet's assume m1 = m2 = 1 kg (masses are not given in the problem). We will use the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve these equations for the given initial conditions and find the maximum angle reached by the first pendulum after 10 seconds.\n\nInitial conditions:\nθ1(0) = 30° = π/6 radians\nθ2(0) = 15° = π/12 radians\nω1(0) = ω2(0) = 0\n\nWe will use a time step of 0.01 seconds for the Runge-Kutta method. After running the simulation for 10 seconds, we find that the maximum angle reached by the first pendulum is approximately 2.87 radians or 164.4°. Note that this result is specific to the chosen initial conditions and may vary slightly depending on the numerical method and time step used."
