    "message_2": "To find the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 3t^2 + 6t + 4 using complex analysis methods, we first need to recall the definition of the Laplace transform:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st) f(t) dt\n\nNow, we will find the Laplace transform of each term in the function f(t) separately and then add them together.\n\n1. Laplace transform of 3t^2:\n\nL{3t^2} = ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st) (3t^2) dt\n\nTo solve this integral, we will use integration by parts twice. Let u = t^2 and dv = e^(-st) dt. Then, du = 2t dt and v = -1/s * e^(-st).\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n∫[0, ∞] e^(-st) (3t^2) dt = -3/s * [t^2 * e^(-st)] [0, ∞] + 3/s * ∫[0, ∞] 2t * e^(-st) dt\n\nNow, we will use integration by parts again on the second integral. Let u = t and dv = e^(-st) dt. Then, du = dt and v = -1/s * e^(-st).\n\n∫[0, ∞] 2t * e^(-st) dt = -2/s * [t * e^(-st)] [0, ∞] + 2/s * ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st) dt\n\nNow, we can integrate the last integral:\n\n∫[0, ∞] e^(-st) dt = -1/s * e^(-st) [0, ∞] = 1/s\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nL{3t^2} = -3/s * [0 - 0] + 3/s * (-2/s * [0 - 0] + 2/s * 1/s) = 6/s^3\n\n2. Laplace transform of 6t:\n\nL{6t} = ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st) (6t) dt\n\nUsing integration by parts with u = t and dv = e^(-st) dt, we get:\n\nL{6t} = -6/s * [t * e^(-st)] [0, ∞] + 6/s * ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st) dt = 6/s^2\n\n3. Laplace transform of 4:\n\nL{4} = ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st) (4) dt = 4 * ∫[0, ∞] e^(-st) dt = 4 * (-1/s * e^(-st) [0, ∞]) = 4/s\n\nNow, we can add the Laplace transforms of each term together:\n\nL{f(t)} = L{3t^2} + L{6t} + L{4} = 6/s^3 + 6/s^2 + 4/s\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 3t^2 + 6t + 4 is:\n\nF(s) = 6/s^3 + 6/s^2 + 4/s"
