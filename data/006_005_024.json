    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k defective units\n- n is the total number of units produced (in this case, 500)\n- k is the number of defective units we want to find the probability for (in this case, 3)\n- p is the probability of a unit being defective (in this case, 0.005)\n- 1-p is the probability of a unit not being defective (in this case, 0.995)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k defective units from n total units, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X = 3) = (500C3) * (0.005^3) * (0.995^497)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 500C3:\n\n500C3 = 500! / (3!(500-3)!)\n= 500! / (3! * 497!)\n= (500 * 499 * 498) / (3 * 2 * 1)\n= 20708500\n\nNow, let's calculate the rest of the equation:\n\nP(X = 3) = 20708500 * (0.005^3) * (0.995^497)\n= 20708500 * 0.000125 * 0.995^497\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\n0.995^497 ≈ 0.000045\n\nNow, multiply all the values together:\n\nP(X = 3) = 20708500 * 0.000125 * 0.000045\n≈ 0.139\n\nSo, the probability of having exactly 3 defective units in a given day is approximately 0.139 or 13.9%."
