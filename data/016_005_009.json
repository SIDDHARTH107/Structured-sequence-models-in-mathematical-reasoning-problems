    "message_2": "The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each interval. Let's analyze the lengths of the remaining intervals after each step:\n\n1. Start with an interval of length 1.\n2. After the first step, we remove the middle third, leaving two intervals of length 1/3 each. The total length is now 2 * (1/3) = 2/3.\n3. In the second step, we remove the middle third of each of the two remaining intervals, leaving four intervals of length 1/9 each. The total length is now 4 * (1/9) = 4/9.\n4. In the third step, we remove the middle third of each of the four remaining intervals, leaving eight intervals of length 1/27 each. The total length is now 8 * (1/27) = 8/27.\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging. After n steps, we have 2^n intervals, each of length (1/3)^n. The total length of the remaining intervals after n steps is:\n\n(2^n) * (1/3)^n = (2/3)^n\n\nAs we continue the process infinitely (n approaches infinity), the total length of the remaining intervals approaches:\n\nlim (n -> âˆž) (2/3)^n = 0\n\nSo, the total length of the remaining intervals in the Cantor set is 0."
