    "message_2": "The isometry group of a 2-dimensional manifold M, in this case, the surface of a sphere S^2 with radius 3, is the group of all rigid motions (rotations and reflections) that preserve distances between points on M.\n\nThe isometry group of S^2 is O(3), the orthogonal group in 3 dimensions. O(3) consists of all 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1 (rotations) and determinant -1 (reflections). The subgroup of O(3) consisting of rotations is called SO(3), the special orthogonal group in 3 dimensions.\n\nNow, let's determine the non-trivial isometries of M. A non-trivial isometry is an isometry that is not the identity map (i.e., it moves at least one point on the sphere). The non-trivial isometries of S^2 can be described by the action of the elements of O(3) on the sphere.\n\nThe sphere S^2 has a high degree of symmetry, and its non-trivial isometries can be described by the action of rotations and reflections about axes passing through the origin. In particular, we can consider the action of the elements of O(3) corresponding to the symmetries of a regular icosahedron inscribed in the sphere. The icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces.\n\nThe non-trivial isometries of S^2 corresponding to the symmetries of the icosahedron are:\n\n1. Rotations:\n   a. 72°, 144°, 216°, and 288° rotations about the axes passing through pairs of opposite vertices (5 axes, 4 rotations each, total of 20 rotations).\n   b. 120° and 240° rotations about the axes passing through the midpoints of opposite edges (15 axes, 2 rotations each, total of 30 rotations).\n   c. 180° rotations about the axes passing through the centers of opposite faces (10 axes, 1 rotation each, total of 10 rotations).\n\n2. Reflections:\n   a. Reflections about planes passing through opposite vertices and the midpoints of the edges connecting them (5 planes).\n   b. Reflections about planes passing through the midpoints of opposite edges and the centers of the faces adjacent to them (15 planes).\n   c. Reflections about planes passing through the centers of opposite faces and the midpoints of the edges connecting them (10 planes).\n\nIn total, there are 20 + 30 + 10 + 5 + 15 + 10 = 90 non-trivial isometries of S^2 corresponding to the symmetries of the icosahedron. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of all non-trivial isometries of S^2, but it gives a good idea of the types of symmetries that the sphere possesses."
