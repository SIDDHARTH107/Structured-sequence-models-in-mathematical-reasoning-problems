    "message_1": "A local bakery has 60 pounds of flour and 48 pounds of sugar to make two types of cakes: chocolate cakes and lemon cakes. Each chocolate cake requires 2 pounds of flour and 3 pounds of sugar, while each lemon cake requires 4 pounds of flour and 2 pounds of sugar. The bakery wants to maximize its profit by selling all the cakes it can make from the available ingredients. The profit for each chocolate cake is $5 and the profit for each lemon cake is $4. How many chocolate cakes and lemon cakes should the bakery make to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of chocolate cakes and y be the number of lemon cakes.\n\nThe bakery has 60 pounds of flour and 48 pounds of sugar. So, we have the following constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 60 (flour constraint)\n3x + 2y ≤ 48 (sugar constraint)\n\nWe also have the non-negativity constraints:\n\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 4y\n\nFirst, we'll solve the constraint inequalities for y:\n\nFlour constraint: y ≤ (60 - 2x) / 4\nSugar constraint: y ≤ (48 - 3x) / 2\n\nNow, we'll find the feasible region by plotting these inequalities on a graph:\n\n1. For the flour constraint: y ≤ (60 - 2x) / 4\nWhen x = 0, y = 15\nWhen y = 0, x = 30\n\n2. For the sugar constraint: y ≤ (48 - 3x) / 2\nWhen x = 0, y = 24\nWhen y = 0, x = 16\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at points A(0, 0), B(0, 15), C(12, 12), and D(16, 0).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 4y at each vertex:\n\nA(0, 0): P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 4(0) = $0\nB(0, 15): P(0, 15) = 5(0) + 4(15) = $60\nC(12, 12): P(12, 12) = 5(12) + 4(12) = $108\nD(16, 0): P(16, 0) = 5(16) + 4(0) = $80\n\nThe maximum profit is $108, which occurs when the bakery makes 12 chocolate cakes and 12 lemon cakes."
