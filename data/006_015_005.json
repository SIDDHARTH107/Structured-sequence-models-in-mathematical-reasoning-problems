    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of a ransomware attack within a year, we can use the historical data provided. \n\nIn the last 5 years, there have been 12 ransomware attacks on the network. We can assume that the probability of an attack remains constant over time. \n\nFirst, we need to find the average number of attacks per year:\n\nTotal number of attacks = 12\nTotal number of years = 5\n\nAverage number of attacks per year = Total number of attacks / Total number of years\nAverage number of attacks per year = 12 / 5\nAverage number of attacks per year = 2.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of a ransomware attack within a year using the Poisson distribution formula:\n\nP(x) = (e^(-λ) * λ^x) / x!\n\nWhere:\nP(x) is the probability of x attacks in a year\nλ (lambda) is the average number of attacks per year (2.4 in this case)\nx is the number of attacks we want to find the probability for (1 attack in this case)\ne is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nFor 1 attack within a year:\n\nP(1) = (e^(-2.4) * 2.4^1) / 1!\nP(1) = (0.0907 * 2.4) / 1\nP(1) = 0.2177\n\nSo, the probability of a network experiencing a ransomware attack within a year is approximately 21.77%."
