    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, two sides are of length 10 cm each and the angle between them is 60 degrees. What is the length of the third side of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the third side of the isosceles triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle C between sides a and b, the following equation holds:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, the isosceles triangle has two sides of length 10 cm each (a = b = 10 cm) and an angle of 60 degrees between them (C = 60 degrees). First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians:\n\n60 degrees * (π/180) = π/3 radians\n\nNow we can apply the Law of Cosines:\n\nc² = 10² + 10² - 2 * 10 * 10 * cos(π/3)\nc² = 100 + 100 - 200 * (1/2)\nc² = 200 - 100\nc² = 100\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nc = √100\nc = 10 cm\n\nSo, the length of the third side of the isosceles triangle is 10 cm."
