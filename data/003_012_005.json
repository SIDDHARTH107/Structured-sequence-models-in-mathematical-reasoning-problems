    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry. We have the angle of elevation (60 degrees) and the height of the tower (40 meters). We can use the tangent function to find the distance between the point on the ground and the base of the tower.\n\nThe tangent function is defined as the ratio of the opposite side (height of the tower) to the adjacent side (distance between the point and the base of the tower). In this case, we have:\n\ntan(60°) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(60°) = 40 meters / distance\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3, so we have:\n\n√3 = 40 meters / distance\n\nNow, we can solve for the distance:\n\ndistance = 40 meters / √3\ndistance ≈ 40 meters / 1.732\ndistance ≈ 23.094 meters\n\nRounding to the nearest meter, the distance between the point on the ground and the base of the tower is approximately 23 meters."
