    "message_2": "The statement is true. \n\nFor any two real numbers x and y, we can find the average by adding them together and dividing by 2. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nz = (x + y) / 2\n\nSince x and y are real numbers, their sum (x + y) is also a real number. Dividing a real number by 2 will also result in a real number. Therefore, there exists a real number z that is the average of x and y."
