    "message_2": "The method of least squares is used to find the best fit line for a set of data points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals (the difference between the observed value and the fitted value). However, in this problem, we are given a system of linear equations, not a set of data points. Therefore, the method of least squares is not applicable here.\n\nInstead, we can solve this system of linear equations using other methods, such as Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion. I will use the matrix inversion method to solve the system.\n\nFirst, let's write the system of linear equations in matrix form:\n\n```\n[ 5  2 -3 ] [x]   [12]\n[-4  3  1 ] [y] = [ 8]\n[ 2  1  1 ] [z]   [ 3]\n```\n\nLet A be the matrix of coefficients, X be the column vector of variables (x, y, z), and B be the column vector of constants (12, 8, 3):\n\nA = |  5  2 -3 |\n    | -4  3  1 |\n    |  2  1  1 |\n\nB = | 12 |\n    |  8 |\n    |  3 |\n\nTo find X, we can use the formula X = A^(-1) * B, where A^(-1) is the inverse of matrix A.\n\nFirst, we need to find the inverse of matrix A. Using a matrix calculator or by hand, we find that:\n\nA^(-1) = |  1/13  2/13  3/13 |\n         |  4/13  5/13 -6/13 |\n         | -2/13  1/13  4/13 |\n\nNow, we can multiply A^(-1) by B:\n\nX = A^(-1) * B = |  1/13  2/13  3/13 |   | 12 |\n                 |  4/13  5/13 -6/13 | * |  8 |\n                 | -2/13  1/13  4/13 |   |  3 |\n\nX = | 1 |\n    | 2 |\n    | 1 |\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 2, and z = 1. Note that the noise level of 2% is not relevant to solving this system of linear equations, as it would only be applicable in a least squares problem with a set of data points."
