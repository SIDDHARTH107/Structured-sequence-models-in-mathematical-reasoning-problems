    "message_2": "To find the diagonal matrix D and the invertible matrix P, we need to diagonalize the matrix A. We will first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.\n\n1. Find the eigenvalues:\nTo find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0, where λ represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nA - λI = [[2 - λ, -1], [4, 5 - λ]]\n\ndet(A - λI) = (2 - λ)(5 - λ) - (-1)(4) = λ^2 - 7λ + 10 + 4 = λ^2 - 7λ + 14\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of the characteristic polynomial:\n\nλ^2 - 7λ + 14 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nλ = (7 ± √(49 - 56))/2 = (7 ± √(-7))/2\n\nSince the eigenvalues are complex, we cannot diagonalize the matrix A with real numbers. Therefore, it is not possible to find a diagonal matrix D and an invertible matrix P such that A = PDP^(-1) using real numbers."
