    "message_2": "To find the number of lines contained in the hypersurface $Q$, we will use the intersection theory on the Fano variety $V$ of lines in $\\mathbb{P}^4$. \n\nFirst, let's compute the class of the hypersurface $Q$. The degree of the polynomial defining $Q$ is $3$, so the class of $Q$ in the Chow ring of $\\mathbb{P}^4$ is $3H$, where $H$ is the class of a hyperplane.\n\nNow, let's consider the incidence correspondence $I \\subset V \\times \\mathbb{P}^4$, which is the set of pairs $(l, p)$, where $l$ is a line in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ and $p$ is a point on $l$. The projection maps are $\\pi_1: I \\to V$ and $\\pi_2: I \\to \\mathbb{P}^4$. The class of the incidence correspondence in the Chow ring of $V \\times \\mathbb{P}^4$ is given by $\\pi_1^*([V]) \\cdot \\pi_2^*(3H)$.\n\nWe want to compute the intersection number $[V] \\cdot Q = \\pi_1^*([V]) \\cdot \\pi_2^*(3H) \\cdot [V]$. To do this, we use the following formula:\n\n$$[V] \\cdot Q = \\int_V \\pi_{1*}(\\pi_2^*(3H) \\cdot [V])$$\n\nNow, we need to compute the pushforward $\\pi_{1*}(\\pi_2^*(3H) \\cdot [V])$. Since the Fano variety $V$ of lines in $\\mathbb{P}^4$ has dimension $4$, the pushforward will be a $4$-cycle on $V$. \n\nLet $l$ be a line in $\\mathbb{P}^4$. The intersection of $l$ with the hypersurface $Q$ is given by the intersection of $l$ with the divisor $3H$. Since $l$ is a line, it has degree $1$, so the intersection number is $3$. Therefore, the pushforward is given by:\n\n$$\\pi_{1*}(\\pi_2^*(3H) \\cdot [V]) = 3[V]$$\n\nFinally, we compute the intersection number:\n\n$$[V] \\cdot Q = \\int_V 3[V] = 3 \\int_V [V]$$\n\nThe integral $\\int_V [V]$ is the top self-intersection number of the Fano variety $V$, which is equal to the number of lines in a general quintic threefold. This number is known to be $2875$ (see, for example, Harris's \"Algebraic Geometry: A First Course\", Exercise 18.21). Therefore, the number of lines contained in the hypersurface $Q$ is:\n\n$$[V] \\cdot Q = 3 \\cdot 2875 = 8625$$\n\nSo there are $8625$ lines contained in the hypersurface $Q$."
