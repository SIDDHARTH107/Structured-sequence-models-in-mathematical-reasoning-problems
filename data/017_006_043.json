    "message_2": "A group of order 35 has a structure that is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7. This is because 35 is the product of two distinct prime numbers, 5 and 7. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, a group of order 35 must be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups.\n\nIn this case, the Sylow 5-subgroup has order 5 and the Sylow 7-subgroup has order 7. Since both of these subgroups are cyclic (as they have prime order), their direct product will also be cyclic. Therefore, a group of order 35 is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 5 and 7, and it is also cyclic."
