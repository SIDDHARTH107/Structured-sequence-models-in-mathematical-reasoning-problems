    "message_2": "An orthogonal array is denoted by OA(n, k, s, t), where n is the number of rows, k is the number of columns, s is the number of symbols (or levels), and t is the strength of the array.\n\nIn this case, we have k = 3 and s = 4. To find the number of rows (n), we need to consider the strength (t) of the array. For a strength t = 1, the number of rows n can be calculated using the formula:\n\nn ≥ s^t\n\nFor t = 1, we have:\n\nn ≥ 4^1\nn ≥ 4\n\nSo, the minimum number of rows for an orthogonal array with k = 3, s = 4, and t = 1 is 4. However, the actual number of rows may be higher depending on the specific orthogonal array."
