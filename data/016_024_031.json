    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal that is formed by recursively removing squares from a larger square. In each iteration, the remaining squares from the previous iteration are divided into 9 equal smaller squares, and the central square is removed.\n\nThe number of removed squares in each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRemoved squares = (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nWhere n is the iteration number.\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nRemoved squares = (8^5 - 1) / 7\nRemoved squares = (32768 - 1) / 7\nRemoved squares = 32767 / 7\nRemoved squares = 4681\n\nSo, in the 5th iteration, there are 4681 removed squares. Since the initial square is considered as one square, the total number of squares in the 5th iteration is:\n\nTotal squares = Initial square - Removed squares\nTotal squares = 1 - 4681\nTotal squares = -4680\n\nHowever, this answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the number of squares cannot be negative. The formula used above calculates the number of removed squares, not the remaining squares.\n\nTo find the remaining squares, we can use the following formula:\n\nRemaining squares = 8^n - (8^n - 1) / 7\n\nFor the 5th iteration:\n\nRemaining squares = 8^5 - (8^5 - 1) / 7\nRemaining squares = 32768 - 4681\nRemaining squares = 28087\n\nSo, there are 28087 squares in the 5th iteration of the Sierpinski carpet fractal."
