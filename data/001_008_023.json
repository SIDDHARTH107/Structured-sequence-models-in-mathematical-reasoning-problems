    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 5 < 17, follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n2x + 5 - 5 < 17 - 5\n2x < 12\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\n(2x)/2 < 12/2\nx < 6\n\nThe solution to the inequality is x < 6.\n\nTo graph the solution on a number line:\n\n1. Draw a number line with numbers from 0 to 10 (you can extend it further if you want, but this range is enough for our solution).\n\n2. Locate the number 6 on the number line.\n\n3. Since the inequality is \"x < 6\" (less than 6), draw an open circle at 6 to indicate that 6 is not included in the solution.\n\n4. Shade the region to the left of the open circle, indicating that all numbers less than 6 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph of the solution will have an open circle at 6 and the shaded region extending to the left of the circle, representing all numbers less than 6."
