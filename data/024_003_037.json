    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parametrize the surface by the position vector r(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2), where u = x and v = y.\n\nNow, we find the first partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\nr_u = ∂r/∂u = (1, 0, 2u)\nr_v = ∂r/∂v = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nNext, we find the second partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v:\nr_uu = ∂²r/∂u² = (0, 0, 2)\nr_uv = ∂²r/∂u∂v = (0, 0, 0)\nr_vv = ∂²r/∂v² = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the first fundamental form (E, F, and G) and the second fundamental form (L, M, and N):\nE = r_u • r_u = (1, 0, 2u) • (1, 0, 2u) = 1 + 4u^2\nF = r_u • r_v = (1, 0, 2u) • (0, 1, 2v) = 4uv\nG = r_v • r_v = (0, 1, 2v) • (0, 1, 2v) = 1 + 4v^2\n\nL = r_uu • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, 0, 1) = 2\nM = r_uv • N = (0, 0, 0) • (0, 0, 1) = 0\nN = r_vv • N = (0, 0, 2) • (0, 0, 1) = 2\n\nHere, N is the unit normal vector to the surface.\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 1, 2), we have u = 1 and v = 1, so we can substitute these values into the coefficients:\n\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\n\nL = 2\nM = 0\nN = 2\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\n\nK = (2 * 2 - 0^2) / (5 * 5 - 4^2) = 4 / 9\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1, 1, 2) is K = 4/9."
