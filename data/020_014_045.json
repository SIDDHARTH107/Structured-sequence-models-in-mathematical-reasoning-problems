    "message_1": "A manufacturing company needs to decide how many units of a certain product to produce in order to maximize profits. The cost of producing each unit is given by the function C(x) = 100x + 100/x, where x is the number of units produced. The selling price P(x) is given by the function P(x) = 300 - 2x. How many units should the company produce to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize profit, we need to find the difference between the selling price and the cost of producing each unit, which is the profit function. Let's denote the profit function as R(x).\n\nR(x) = P(x) - C(x)\n\nSubstitute the given functions:\n\nR(x) = (300 - 2x) - (100x + 100/x)\n\nNow, to find the maximum profit, we need to find the critical points of the profit function by taking its derivative and setting it to zero.\n\nR'(x) = d/dx [(300 - 2x) - (100x + 100/x)]\n\nR'(x) = -2 - 100 + (-100/x^2)\n\nSet R'(x) to 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = -2 - 100 + (-100/x^2)\n\n102 = 100/x^2\n\nMultiply both sides by x^2:\n\n102x^2 = 100\n\nDivide both sides by 102:\n\nx^2 = 100/102\n\nx^2 = 50/51\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nx = sqrt(50/51)\n\nx â‰ˆ 0.987\n\nSince x represents the number of units produced, it should be a whole number. We can check the profit function for x = 1 and x = 2 to see which one gives a higher profit:\n\nR(1) = (300 - 2(1)) - (100(1) + 100/1) = 198 - 200 = -2\nR(2) = (300 - 2(2)) - (100(2) + 100/2) = 296 - 250 = 46\n\nSince R(2) is greater than R(1), the company should produce 2 units to maximize its profit."
