    "message_1": "Two accomplices, A and B, are arrested for a bank robbery. They are taken to separate rooms and cannot communicate with each other. The prosecutor explains that if one of them confesses and the other remains silent, the confessor will be rewarded with a reduced sentence and the silent one will receive the maximum sentence. If both confess, they will both receive a moderate sentence. If both remain silent, they will both get a lighter sentence. The prosecutor offers each of them a deal: If one confesses and implicates the other, the confessor will get a reduced sentence of 3 years, while the other serves 10 years. If neither of them confesses, they'll each serve 5 years for a lesser crime that the prosecutor can prove. What should they do to minimize their collective prison time?",
    "message_2": "To minimize their collective prison time, both accomplices A and B should remain silent. If they both remain silent, they will each serve 5 years for a total of 10 years of collective prison time. In any other scenario, their collective prison time will be greater than 10 years."
