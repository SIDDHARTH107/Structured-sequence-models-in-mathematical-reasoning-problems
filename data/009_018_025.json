    "message_2": "To determine the amplitude and period of the steady-state oscillation of the Duffing oscillator, we first need to find the steady-state solution of the given differential equation. In the steady-state, the driving force $F(t)$ will have the same frequency as the response of the oscillator. Therefore, we assume a solution of the form:\n\n$x(t) = X \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$\n\nwhere $X$ is the amplitude, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\phi$ is the phase shift. Since $F(t) = 2\\sin(t)$, we have $\\omega = 1$.\n\nNow, we need to find the first and second derivatives of $x(t)$:\n\n$\\dot{x}(t) = X\\omega \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$\n\n$\\ddot{x}(t) = -X\\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$\n\nSubstitute these derivatives and the given parameter values into the Duffing equation:\n\n$-X\\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi) + 2\\gamma X\\omega \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) + 2X\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi) - 0.1X^3\\sin^3(\\omega t + \\phi) = 2\\sin(t)$\n\nSince $\\omega = 1$, we have:\n\n$-X \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi) + 0.6X \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi) + 2X\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi) - 0.1X^3\\sin^3(\\omega t + \\phi) = 2\\sin(t)$\n\nNow, equate the coefficients of $\\sin(t)$ and $\\cos(t)$ on both sides:\n\n$(-X + 2X) = 2$\n\n$0.6X = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $X = 0$. However, this is a trivial solution and does not represent the steady-state oscillation. Therefore, we need to consider the nonlinear term $-0.1X^3\\sin^3(\\omega t + \\phi)$, which makes the problem more complex and requires numerical methods to solve for $X$ and $\\phi$.\n\nTo find the amplitude and period of the steady-state oscillation, we can use numerical methods such as the shooting method or continuation method to solve the Duffing equation with the given parameter values. The period of the oscillation will be $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} = 2\\pi$."
