    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cone, we need to calculate the area of the base (a circle) and the lateral area (a sector of a circle), and then add them together.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of the base:\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr², where A is the area and r is the radius.\nIn this case, the radius of the base is 8 cm.\n\nA_base = π(8 cm)² = 64π cm²\n\nNow, let's find the lateral area:\nThe formula for the lateral area of a cone is A_lateral = πrs, where r is the radius and s is the slant height.\nIn this case, the radius is 8 cm and the slant height is 15 cm.\n\nA_lateral = π(8 cm)(15 cm) = 120π cm²\n\nFinally, let's add the base area and the lateral area to find the total surface area of the cone:\n\nA_total = A_base + A_lateral = 64π cm² + 120π cm² = 184π cm²\n\nSo, the surface area of the cone is 184π cm²."
