    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with a construction parameter of N = 3, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn this case, the Vicsek fractal is created by starting with an equilateral triangle and replacing each line segment with a smaller equilateral triangle. This results in 3 self-similar pieces (N = 3), and each piece is scaled down by a factor of 2 (s = 2).\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nD = log(3) / log(2)\n\nD â‰ˆ 1.5849625\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension of the Vicsek fractal with a construction parameter of N = 3 is approximately 1.585."
