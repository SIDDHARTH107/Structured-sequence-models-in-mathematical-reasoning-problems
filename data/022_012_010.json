    "message_2": "To find the poles of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 4)/(z^2 + 4), we need to find the values of z for which the denominator becomes zero. \n\nThe denominator is z^2 + 4. To find the zeros, we set the denominator equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 4 = 0\n\nz^2 = -4\n\nz = ±√(-4) = ±2i\n\nSo, the poles of the function f(z) are at z = 2i and z = -2i.\n\nNow, we need to determine the order of these poles. The order of a pole is the number of times the denominator becomes zero at that point. In this case, the denominator is a quadratic polynomial, and each pole appears only once in the denominator. Therefore, the order of both poles is 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) = (z^2 - 4)/(z^2 + 4) has two poles at z = 2i and z = -2i, and both poles have order 1."
