    "message_2": "To find the cosine value of a 30-degree angle using the unit circle, we can use the fact that a 30-degree angle is equivalent to π/6 radians. In the unit circle, the cosine value represents the x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the circle.\n\nFor a 30-degree angle (π/6 radians), the cosine value is:\n\ncos(30°) = cos(π/6) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866\n\nSo, the cosine value of a 30-degree angle is approximately 0.866."
