    "message_1": "In a certain region, the probability of a hurricane occurring in any given year is 0.03, while the probability of an earthquake occurring is 0.02. What is the probability that in a given year, either a hurricane or an earthquake (or both) will occur in the region?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of either a hurricane or an earthquake (or both) occurring in a given year, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A is the event of a hurricane occurring, B is the event of an earthquake occurring, and A ∩ B is the event of both a hurricane and an earthquake occurring.\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of both a hurricane and an earthquake occurring in the same year. We can assume that the events are independent, so we can multiply their probabilities:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.03 * 0.02 = 0.0006\n\nNow we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.03 + 0.02 - 0.0006 = 0.0494\n\nSo, the probability that in a given year, either a hurricane or an earthquake (or both) will occur in the region is 0.0494 or 4.94%."
