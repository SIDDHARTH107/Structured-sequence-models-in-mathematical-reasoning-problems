    "message_1": "In an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides each measure 5 cm. If the perimeter of the triangle is 15 cm, what is the length of the remaining side?",
    "message_2": "If the perimeter of the triangle is 15 cm and the two equal sides each measure 5 cm, then the remaining side can be found using the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:\n\nPerimeter = Side1 + Side2 + Side3\n\nIn this case, the perimeter is 15 cm, and the two equal sides are 5 cm each:\n\n15 = 5 + 5 + Side3\n\nTo find the length of the remaining side (Side3), subtract the sum of the two equal sides from the perimeter:\n\n15 - (5 + 5) = Side3\n15 - 10 = Side3\n5 = Side3\n\nSo, the length of the remaining side is 5 cm."
