    "message_1": "Suppose we have a message to encrypt using the ElGamal cryptosystem, with public key (p = 13, g = 3, y = 4), where p is a prime number, g is a primitive root modulo p, and y = g^x mod p for some private key x. The message is m = 5. \n\nDetermine the values of the ephemeral key k and the ciphertext (a,b) produced by ElGamal encryption, where a = g^k mod p and b = m*y^k mod p.",
    "message_2": "To determine the values of the ephemeral key k and the ciphertext (a, b) produced by ElGamal encryption, we first need to choose a random value for k. Let's choose k = 7 (you can choose any other value between 1 and p-2, but for this example, we will use 7).\n\nNow, we can compute a and b using the formulas provided:\n\na = g^k mod p\na = 3^7 mod 13\na = 2187 mod 13\na = 3\n\nb = m*y^k mod p\nb = 5*4^7 mod 13\nb = 5*16384 mod 13\nb = 81920 mod 13\nb = 12\n\nSo, the ephemeral key k is 7, and the ciphertext (a, b) produced by ElGamal encryption is (3, 12)."
