    "message_2": "We can rewrite the given equation as:\n\n$(z^2 + 10z + 25) = 0$\n\nNow, we can observe that this is a perfect square trinomial. It can be factored as:\n\n$(z + 5)^2 = 0$\n\nTo find the complex roots of the equation, we set the factor equal to zero:\n\n$z + 5 = 0$\n\nSolving for $z$, we get:\n\n$z = -5$\n\nSince this is a quadratic equation, it has two roots. However, in this case, both roots are the same:\n\n$z_1 = -5$ and $z_2 = -5$\n\nSo, the complex roots of the given equation are $z_1 = -5$ and $z_2 = -5$."
