    "message_2": "To find the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 coin flips, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- n is the total number of coin flips (10 in this case)\n- k is the number of successful outcomes (6 heads)\n- p is the probability of success (0.5 for heads)\n- q is the probability of failure (0.5 for tails)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 6) = (10C6) * (0.5^6) * (0.5^4)\n\nFirst, we calculate 10C6:\n\n10C6 = 10! / (6!(10-6)!)\n= 10! / (6!4!)\n= (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 210\n\nNow, we calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.5^6) = 0.015625\n(0.5^4) = 0.0625\n\nFinally, we multiply all the values together:\n\nP(X = 6) = 210 * 0.015625 * 0.0625\n= 0.205078125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 6 heads in 10 coin flips is approximately 0.2051 or 20.51%."
