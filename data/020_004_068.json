    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $20,000 to allocate between two marketing campaigns: TV ads and social media ads. The cost of airing a TV ad is $1000 and the cost of promoting an ad on social media is $100. The company wants to maximize the number of people reached, and it is estimated that for every TV ad, 500 people will see it, and for every social media ad, 100 people will see it. However, the company has a limit of 20 ads that they can air in total. What is the maximum number of people the company can reach, and how many ads of each type should they allocate to reach this maximum?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of TV ads and y be the number of social media ads. We have the following constraints:\n\n1. The total cost constraint: 1000x + 100y ≤ 20,000\n2. The total number of ads constraint: x + y ≤ 20\n3. The non-negativity constraints: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0\n\nWe want to maximize the number of people reached, which is given by the objective function: P = 500x + 100y.\n\nFirst, we will solve the total cost constraint for y:\n\n1000x + 100y ≤ 20,000\ny ≤ (20,000 - 1000x) / 100\ny ≤ 200 - 10x\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by plotting the constraints on a graph:\n\n1. y ≤ 200 - 10x\n2. y ≤ 20 - x\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 20), (2, 18), and (20, 0).\n\nNow, we will evaluate the objective function P = 500x + 100y at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 0) = 500(0) + 100(0) = 0\n2. P(0, 20) = 500(0) + 100(20) = 2000\n3. P(2, 18) = 500(2) + 100(18) = 1000(2) + 1800 = 3800\n4. P(20, 0) = 500(20) + 100(0) = 10,000\n\nThe maximum number of people reached is 10,000, which occurs when the company allocates 20 TV ads and 0 social media ads."
