    "message_2": "To prove that there is only one group of order 20 up to isomorphism, we will use the Sylow theorems. Let G be a group of order 20. Since 20 = 2^2 * 5, by the Sylow theorems, we know that G has a 2-Sylow subgroup P of order 4 and a 5-Sylow subgroup Q of order 5.\n\nBy the Sylow theorems, the number of 5-Sylow subgroups, n_5, divides 4 and is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Thus, n_5 = 1, which means that Q is a normal subgroup of G. Similarly, the number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, divides 5 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 5.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1\nIf n_2 = 1, then P is also a normal subgroup of G. Since P and Q are both normal subgroups of G, and their orders are relatively prime, G is isomorphic to the direct product of P and Q, i.e., G ≅ P × Q. Since P has order 4 and Q has order 5, G is isomorphic to either Z_4 × Z_5 or Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_5. However, Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_5 is not a group of order 20, so G must be isomorphic to Z_4 × Z_5, which is isomorphic to Z_20.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 5\nIf n_2 = 5, then there are 5 distinct 2-Sylow subgroups of G. Let P_1, P_2, ..., P_5 be these subgroups. Since the intersection of any two distinct 2-Sylow subgroups is trivial, we have that |P_1 ∩ P_2 ∩ ... ∩ P_5| = 1. Now, consider the normalizer N(P_i) of each P_i in G. By the Sylow theorems, the index of N(P_i) in G is equal to n_2, i.e., [G : N(P_i)] = 5. Thus, |N(P_i)| = 4 for each i. Since Q is a normal subgroup of G of order 5, we have Q ≤ N(P_i) for each i. Therefore, N(P_i) = P_iQ for each i.\n\nNow, consider the action of G on the set of 2-Sylow subgroups by conjugation. This action induces a homomorphism φ: G → S_5. The kernel of φ, K, is the largest normal subgroup of G contained in all N(P_i), i.e., K = ⋂ N(P_i) = ⋂ P_iQ. Since |P_iQ| = 20 for each i, we have |K| = 20/5 = 4. Thus, K is a 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Since K is normal in G, we have G/K ≅ φ(G) ≤ S_5. Therefore, |G/K| divides |S_5| = 120. But |G/K| = |G|/|K| = 20/4 = 5, so G/K is a group of order 5. Thus, G/K is cyclic, and G is an extension of K by a cyclic group of order 5. It follows that G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of K and Q, i.e., G ≅ K ⋊ Q. Since K is isomorphic to Z_4 and Q is isomorphic to Z_5, G is isomorphic to Z_4 ⋊ Z_5. However, there is only one nontrivial action of Z_5 on Z_4, which corresponds to the automorphism of Z_4 given by inversion. This action gives rise to the dihedral group D_10 of order 20.\n\nIn both cases, we see that G is either isomorphic to Z_20 or D_10. Since Z_20 and D_10 are not isomorphic to each other, there is only one group of order 20 up to isomorphism."
