    "message_2": "To find a birational map from the curve C to the line y = 0, we need to find a rational function that maps points on C to points on the line y = 0. We can start by finding a rational function that maps points on C to points on the projective plane.\n\nLet's consider the projective closure of C in the projective plane P^2. We can homogenize the equation of C by introducing a new variable z:\n\ny^2z + xyz + x^3 = 0.\n\nNow, we can find a rational function that maps points on the projective closure of C to points on the projective line P^1. We can use the rational function φ : (x : y : z) ↦ (x : y), which maps points on the projective closure of C to points on the projective line P^1.\n\nNow, we need to find a rational function that maps points on the projective line P^1 to points on the line y = 0. We can use the rational function ψ : (x : y) ↦ (x : 0), which maps points on the projective line P^1 to points on the line y = 0.\n\nFinally, we can compose the rational functions φ and ψ to obtain a birational map from C to the line y = 0:\n\nψ ◦ φ : (x : y : z) ↦ (x : 0).\n\nThis birational map sends points on the curve C to points on the line y = 0. Note that this map is not defined at the point (0 : 1 : 0) on C, which corresponds to the point at infinity in the projective closure of C. However, since birational maps are only required to be defined on an open subset of the domain, this map is still a valid birational map from C to the line y = 0."
