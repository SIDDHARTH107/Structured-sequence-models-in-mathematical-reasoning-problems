    "message_1": "A company wants to determine the optimal price for a new product. The cost to produce the product is $50 per unit, and the demand function for the product is given by the equation P = 200 - 4Q, where P is the price of the product and Q is the quantity demanded in thousands. What should be the price per unit for the company to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal quantity (Q) first, and then we can find the optimal price (P) using the demand function.\n\nThe profit function can be defined as:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n\nRevenue = Price × Quantity = P × Q\nCost = Cost per unit × Quantity = $50 × Q\n\nSo, Profit = (P × Q) - ($50 × Q)\n\nNow, we need to substitute the demand function (P = 200 - 4Q) into the profit function:\n\nProfit = ((200 - 4Q) × Q) - ($50 × Q)\n\nNext, we need to find the derivative of the profit function with respect to Q and set it equal to zero to find the optimal quantity:\n\nd(Profit)/dQ = 0\n\nLet's find the derivative:\n\nd(Profit)/dQ = d((200Q - 4Q^2) - 50Q)/dQ\nd(Profit)/dQ = 200 - 8Q - 50\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero and solve for Q:\n\n0 = 200 - 8Q - 50\n8Q = 150\nQ = 18.75 (in thousands)\n\nNow that we have the optimal quantity, we can find the optimal price using the demand function:\n\nP = 200 - 4Q\nP = 200 - 4(18.75)\nP = 200 - 75\nP = $125\n\nSo, the optimal price per unit for the company to maximize their profit is $125."
