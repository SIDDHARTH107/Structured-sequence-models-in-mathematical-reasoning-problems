    "message_1": "Consider a principal who hires an agent to do a task that could generate a net income of $5,000 with probability 0.8 and a net income of $2,000 with probability of 0.2. However, the agent has the option to loaf on the job, and this shirking activity generates a payoff of $1,000 with probability 1. Determine the amount of money that the principal should offer the agent as a salary to keep the agent motivated to complete the task. Assume that the agent's effort cannot be monitored directly.",
    "message_2": "To determine the amount of money the principal should offer the agent as a salary to keep the agent motivated to complete the task, we need to ensure that the expected payoff from working is greater than or equal to the payoff from shirking.\n\nLet W be the salary offered to the agent if the task generates a net income of $5,000, and let L be the salary offered if the task generates a net income of $2,000. The expected payoff from working is given by:\n\nExpected payoff (working) = 0.8 * W + 0.2 * L\n\nSince the agent gets a payoff of $1,000 with probability 1 when shirking, the expected payoff from shirking is:\n\nExpected payoff (shirking) = $1,000\n\nTo keep the agent motivated, the expected payoff from working should be greater than or equal to the expected payoff from shirking:\n\n0.8 * W + 0.2 * L ≥ $1,000\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum values of W and L that satisfy this inequality. Since the principal wants to minimize the salary costs, we can assume that the principal will offer the same salary for both outcomes, i.e., W = L. Let S be the salary offered for both outcomes:\n\n0.8 * S + 0.2 * S ≥ $1,000\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\nS ≥ $1,000\n\nTherefore, the principal should offer the agent a salary of at least $1,000 to keep the agent motivated to complete the task."
