    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point (1, 3), we first need to find the derivative of the given equation with respect to x. This will give us the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.\n\nGiven equation: y^2 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to x using the chain rule:\n\n2y(dy/dx) = 3x^2 + 6x + 3\n\nNow, solve for dy/dx (the slope of the tangent line):\n\ndy/dx = (3x^2 + 6x + 3) / (2y)\n\nWe are given the point (1, 3), so substitute x = 1 and y = 3 into the equation:\n\ndy/dx = (3(1)^2 + 6(1) + 3) / (2(3))\n\ndy/dx = (3 + 6 + 3) / 6\n\ndy/dx = 12 / 6\n\ndy/dx = 2\n\nNow that we have the slope of the tangent line at the point (1, 3), we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is the given point (1, 3) and m is the slope 2:\n\ny - 3 = 2(x - 1)\n\nNow, simplify the equation:\n\ny - 3 = 2x - 2\n\ny = 2x + 1\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point (1, 3) is y = 2x + 1."
