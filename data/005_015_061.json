Apply k-means clustering algorithm to group these customers into 3 clusters based on their income and age.\n\nThe recorded data is given in the following table:\n\n| Customer | Annual Income (in thousands of dollars) | Age (in years) |\n|----------|----------------------------------------|----------------|\n| 1        | 75                                     | 32             |\n| 2        | 80                                     | 30             |\n| 3        | 45                                     | 28             |\n| 4        | 90                                     | 40             |\n| 5        | 80                                     | 36             |\n| ...      | ...                                    | ...            |\n| 100      | 65                                     | 26             |\n\nUse the k-means clustering algorithm to group these customers into 3 clusters based on their income and age.",
    "message_2": "To apply the k-means clustering algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the centroids: Randomly select 3 data points as the initial centroids. For example, let's choose customers 1, 2, and 3 as the initial centroids.\n\n2. Calculate the distance between each data point and the centroids: Use the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between each customer's data point (annual income and age) and the centroids.\n\n3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid: Based on the calculated distances, assign each customer to the centroid that is closest to their data point.\n\n4. Update the centroids: Calculate the mean of the data points assigned to each centroid and update the centroid coordinates to the mean values.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence: Continue iterating through steps 2-4 until the centroids' positions no longer change significantly or a predetermined number of iterations have been completed.\n\nSince the dataset is not fully provided, I cannot perform the calculations for you. However, you can use a programming language like Python with libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn to perform the k-means clustering algorithm on the complete dataset. Here's a sample code snippet to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\n# Replace this with the actual dataset\ndata = np.array([\n    [75, 32],\n    [80, 30],\n    [45, 28],\n    [90, 40],\n    [80, 36],\n    # ...\n    [65, 26]\n])\n\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0).fit(data)\nlabels = kmeans.labels_\ncentroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_\n```\n\nAfter running the k-means clustering algorithm, you'll have the cluster assignments in the `labels` variable and the final centroids in the `centroids` variable."
