Now, we will graph this solution on a number line.\n\n1. Draw a number line with an arrow on the right side, indicating that the line extends infinitely in the positive direction.\n2. Place a point at 2 on the number line.\n3. Since x > 2, we will draw an open circle at 2 (indicating that 2 is not included in the solution) and shade the region to the right of 2 (indicating that all numbers greater than 2 are part of the solution).\n\nThe graph of the solution on the number line will look like this:\n\n------(2)----->"
