    "message_2": "A twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number. To find the largest twin prime less than 100, we will first list down the prime numbers less than 100 and then identify the twin primes.\n\nPrime numbers less than 100 are:\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\n\nNow, let's identify the twin primes:\n(3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41, 43), (59, 61), (71, 73)\n\nThe largest twin prime pair less than 100 is (71, 73). Since both numbers are twin primes, either of them can be considered the largest twin prime less than 100. However, since the question asks for the largest twin prime, the answer is 73."
