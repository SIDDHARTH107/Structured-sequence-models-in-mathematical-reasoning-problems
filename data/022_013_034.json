    "message_2": "To determine if f(z) is an analytic function, we need to check if it is differentiable everywhere in the complex plane. Let z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. Then we can rewrite f(z) as:\n\nf(z) = (x + yi)^2 + i(x + yi) - 1\n     = (x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy) + (ix - y) - 1\n     = (x^2 - y^2 - 1) + i(2xy + x - y)\n\nNow, let u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 1 and v(x, y) = 2xy + x - y. Then f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y). To check if f(z) is analytic, we need to verify if the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold:\n\n∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x\n\nLet's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂u/∂x = 2x\n∂u/∂y = -2y\n∂v/∂x = 2y + 1\n∂v/∂y = 2x - 1\n\nNow, let's check if the Cauchy-Riemann equations hold:\n\n∂u/∂x = 2x = 2x - 1 = ∂v/∂y\n∂u/∂y = -2y = -(2y + 1) = -∂v/∂x\n\nThe Cauchy-Riemann equations do not hold, so f(z) is not an analytic function on the complex plane."
