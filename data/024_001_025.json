    "message_2": "To find the curvature and torsion of the given space curve, we first need to find the first and second derivatives of the parametric equations with respect to the parameter t. Then, we will use the formulas for curvature and torsion.\n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of x(t), y(t), and z(t):\n\nx(t) = t^3 - 3t\nx'(t) = 3t^2 - 3\nx''(t) = 6t\n\ny(t) = t^2 - 2\ny'(t) = 2t\ny''(t) = 2\n\nz(t) = 2t + 1\nz'(t) = 2\nz''(t) = 0\n\nNow, let's find the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) using the following formulas:\n\nCurvature (k) = ||T'(t)|| / ||r'(t)||\nTorsion (τ) = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • T'(t) / ||T'(t)||^3\n\nwhere r'(t) = <x'(t), y'(t), z'(t)> and r''(t) = <x''(t), y''(t), z''(t)> are the first and second derivatives of the position vector r(t) = <x(t), y(t), z(t)>, and T'(t) is the derivative of the unit tangent vector T(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||.\n\nFirst, let's find r'(t) and r''(t) at t = 1:\n\nr'(1) = <x'(1), y'(1), z'(1)> = <3(1)^2 - 3, 2(1), 2> = <0, 2, 2>\nr''(1) = <x''(1), y''(1), z''(1)> = <6(1), 2, 0> = <6, 2, 0>\n\nNow, let's find the unit tangent vector T(t) and its derivative T'(t):\n\nT(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||\nT(1) = <0, 2, 2> / ||<0, 2, 2>|| = <0, 2, 2> / √(0^2 + 2^2 + 2^2) = <0, 2, 2> / √8 = <0, 1/√2, 1/√2>\n\nNow, let's find T'(t). We can use the formula:\n\nT'(t) = (r'(t) x r''(t)) / ||r'(t)||^2\n\nT'(1) = <0, 2, 2> x <6, 2, 0> / ||<0, 2, 2>||^2 = <-4, -12, 12> / 8 = <-1/2, -3/2, 3/2>\n\nNow, let's find the curvature k:\n\nk = ||T'(t)|| / ||r'(t)||\nk(1) = ||<-1/2, -3/2, 3/2>|| / ||<0, 2, 2>||\nk(1) = √((-1/2)^2 + (-3/2)^2 + (3/2)^2) / √8 = √(1/4 + 9/4 + 9/4) / √8 = √(19/4) / √8 = √(19/32)\n\nFinally, let's find the torsion τ:\n\nτ = (r'(t) x r''(t)) • T'(t) / ||T'(t)||^3\nτ(1) = (<0, 2, 2> x <6, 2, 0>) • <-1/2, -3/2, 3/2> / ||<-1/2, -3/2, 3/2>||^3\nτ(1) = <-4, -12, 12> • <-1/2, -3/2, 3/2> / (19/4)^(3/2)\nτ(1) = (2 + 18 + 18) / (19/4)^(3/2) = 38 / (19/4)^(3/2) = 2 / (19/4)^(1/2) = 2√(4/19)\n\nSo, the curvature k at t = 1 is k(1) = √(19/32) and the torsion τ at t = 1 is τ(1) = 2√(4/19)."
