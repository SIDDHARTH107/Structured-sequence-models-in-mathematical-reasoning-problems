    "message_1": "Sure, here's a specific problem for a math student to solve:\n\nA metal plate has an initial temperature of 100°C. At time t=0, it is placed in a room where the temperature is constant at 20°C. The temperature of the plate is modeled by the diffusion equation:\n\n∂u/∂t = k(∂²u/∂x²)\n\nwhere u is the temperature, t is time, x is distance on the plate, and k is the thermal diffusivity of the metal (k = 0.01 m²/s). The plate is 1 m by 1 m, and the initial temperature distribution is given by:\n\nu(x,y,0) = 100 sin(πx) sin(πy)\n\nDetermine the temperature distribution u(x,y,t) at time t = 5 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the method of separation of variables. We assume that the solution u(x, y, t) can be written as a product of functions of x, y, and t:\n\nu(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the diffusion equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)dT(t)/dt = k(X''(x)Y(y)T(t))\n\nDividing both sides by kXYT, we get:\n\n(1/kT)dT(t)/dt = X''(x)/X(x) = Y''(y)/Y(y) = -λ\n\nwhere λ is a separation constant. Now we have three ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. X''(x) + λX(x) = 0\n2. Y''(y) + λY(y) = 0\n3. dT(t)/dt + kλT(t) = 0\n\nSolving the first two equations, we get:\n\nX(x) = A sin(√λx) + B cos(√λx)\nY(y) = C sin(√λy) + D cos(√λy)\n\nSince the temperature is constant at the edges of the plate, we have the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, y, t) = u(1, y, t) = u(x, 0, t) = u(x, 1, t) = 0\n\nApplying these boundary conditions, we get B = D = 0 and √λ = nπ for some integer n. Thus, the solutions for X(x) and Y(y) are:\n\nX(x) = A sin(nπx)\nY(y) = C sin(nπy)\n\nNow, we solve the third equation:\n\ndT(t)/dt + kλT(t) = 0\n\nThis is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is:\n\nT(t) = E * exp(-kλt)\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as:\n\nu(x, y, t) = ∑[A_n * sin(nπx) * sin(nπy) * exp(-k(nπ)²t)]\n\nTo find the coefficients A_n, we use the initial condition:\n\nu(x, y, 0) = 100 sin(πx) sin(πy)\n\nComparing this with the general solution, we see that A_1 = 100 and A_n = 0 for n ≠ 1. Thus, the temperature distribution at time t = 5 seconds is:\n\nu(x, y, 5) = 100 * sin(πx) * sin(πy) * exp(-k(π)² * 5)\n\nSubstituting k = 0.01 m²/s, we get:\n\nu(x, y, 5) = 100 * sin(πx) * sin(πy) * exp(-0.01 * π² * 5)"
