    "message_2": "The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. It is used to find the global minimum of complex optimization problems. However, for the given quadratic function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8, we can easily find the minimum value using basic calculus methods without the need for WOA.\n\nTo find the minimum value of f(x), we can find the critical points by taking the first derivative of the function and setting it to zero:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 6\n\nSetting f'(x) to zero:\n\n2x - 6 = 0\n2x = 6\nx = 3\n\nNow, we can find the second derivative to check if this critical point is a minimum:\n\nf''(x) = 2\n\nSince f''(x) is positive, the critical point x = 3 is a minimum. Now, we can find the minimum value of the function by plugging x = 3 back into the original function:\n\nf(3) = (3)^2 - 6(3) + 8\nf(3) = 9 - 18 + 8\nf(3) = -1\n\nSo, the minimum value of the function f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8 is -1."
