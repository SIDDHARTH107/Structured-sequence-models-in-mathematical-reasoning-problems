    "message_2": "To find the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = log(z) on the domain D = {z: -1 < arg(z) < 1}, we first need to define the principal branch of the logarithm function. The principal branch of the logarithm function is given by:\n\nLog(z) = ln|z| + i*Arg(z),\n\nwhere ln|z| denotes the natural logarithm of the absolute value of z, and Arg(z) is the principal argument of z, which lies in the interval (-π, π].\n\nNow, we are given that f(z) is holomorphic on D and f(2) = log(2). Since f(2) = log(2), we can write:\n\nf(z) = Log(z) + 2πik,\n\nwhere k is an integer.\n\nSince f(z) is holomorphic on D = {z: -1 < arg(z) < 1}, we need to find the appropriate value of k such that the function f(z) satisfies the given domain. The principal argument of z, Arg(z), lies in the interval (-π, π]. Therefore, we have:\n\n-1 < Arg(z) + 2πik < 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the integer k that satisfies this inequality. Since Arg(z) lies in the interval (-π, π], we can consider the following cases:\n\n1. If Arg(z) is close to -π, then -1 < -π + 2πik < 1. In this case, k = 0 is the appropriate choice, as it satisfies the inequality.\n\n2. If Arg(z) is close to π, then -1 < π + 2πik < 1. In this case, k = -1 is the appropriate choice, as it satisfies the inequality.\n\nTherefore, the analytic continuation of the function f(z) = log(z) on the domain D = {z: -1 < arg(z) < 1} is given by:\n\nf(z) = Log(z) + 2πi(-1) = Log(z) - 2πi, for z with arg(z) close to π,\n\nand\n\nf(z) = Log(z) + 2πi(0) = Log(z), for z with arg(z) close to -π."
