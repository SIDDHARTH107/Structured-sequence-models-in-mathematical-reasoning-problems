    "message_1": "Let's say a Non-monotonic logic system has 7 rules. The truth value of each rule is either \"True\" or \"False\". If a conclusion is reached by applying those rules and its truth value is \"True\", then what is the minimum number of rules that must be true in order to guarantee the truth value of the conclusion?",
    "message_2": "In a non-monotonic logic system, adding new information can change the truth value of a conclusion. Therefore, it is not possible to guarantee the truth value of the conclusion based on the number of true rules alone. \n\nHowever, if we assume that the conclusion is reached by applying the rules in such a way that the truth value of the conclusion is \"True,\" then we can consider a scenario where the minimum number of true rules is required.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, each rule would be independent and contribute to the conclusion. In this case, at least one rule must be true to guarantee the truth value of the conclusion. So, the minimum number of rules that must be true is 1."
