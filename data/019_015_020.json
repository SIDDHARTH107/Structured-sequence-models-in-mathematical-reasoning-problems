    "message_1": "Here is a precise numerical problem on Type Theory for a math student to solve:\n\nLet's consider three types X, Y, and Z in a Type Theory system. Suppose we have a function f: X → Y and a function g: Y → Z such that g ∘ f is defined. If we have 15 elements in X and 25 elements in Y, how many elements can Z have at the maximum?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum number of elements in Z, we need to consider the maximum number of distinct elements that can be produced by the composition of functions g ∘ f.\n\nSince there are 15 elements in X, the function f: X → Y can map these 15 elements to at most 15 distinct elements in Y (assuming f is injective). Now, we need to consider the function g: Y → Z. Since f maps X to at most 15 distinct elements in Y, g will take at most 15 distinct elements as input.\n\nTo maximize the number of elements in Z, we need g to map these 15 distinct elements in Y to 15 distinct elements in Z (assuming g is also injective). Therefore, the maximum number of elements in Z is 15."
