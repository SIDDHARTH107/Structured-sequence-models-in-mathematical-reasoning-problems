    "message_2": "To determine the value of g, we can use the formula for the Euler characteristic (χ) of a compact connected surface:\n\nχ = 2 - 2g\n\nThe self-intersection number (p) is related to the Euler characteristic by the formula:\n\np = 3χ - 3\n\nWe are given that the self-intersection number is 3, so we can substitute this value into the formula:\n\n3 = 3χ - 3\n\nNow, we can solve for the Euler characteristic:\n\n3 + 3 = 3χ\n6 = 3χ\nχ = 2\n\nNow that we have the Euler characteristic, we can substitute it back into the formula for the genus:\n\n2 = 2 - 2g\n\nSolve for g:\n\n2g = 0\ng = 0\n\nSo, the genus g of the compact connected surface X with a self-intersection number of 3 is 0."
