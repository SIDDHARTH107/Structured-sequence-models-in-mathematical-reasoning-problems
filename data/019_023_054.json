    "message_1": "If the first five terms of a sequence are 1, 3, 7, 13, and 21, what is the formula to find the nth term in the sequence using inductive logic?",
    "message_2": "To find the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we first need to identify the pattern in the given sequence. Let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n3 - 1 = 2\n7 - 3 = 4\n13 - 7 = 6\n21 - 13 = 8\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are increasing by 2 each time. This indicates that the sequence is a quadratic sequence. Let's denote the nth term as T(n). Since it's a quadratic sequence, we can represent it in the form:\n\nT(n) = an^2 + bn + c\n\nNow, we can use the given terms to find the values of a, b, and c:\n\n1. T(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 1\n2. T(2) = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 3\n3. T(3) = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 7\n\nNow we can solve this system of equations. From equation 1, we have:\n\na + b + c = 1\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n4a + 2b + c = 3\n\nFrom equation 3:\n\n9a + 3b + c = 7\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations. Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n3a + b = 2\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\n8a + 2b = 6\n\nNow, we can solve for a by subtracting 2 times equation 3 from equation 4:\n\n2a = 2\na = 1\n\nNow, substitute the value of a back into equation 3:\n\n3(1) + b = 2\nb = -1\n\nFinally, substitute the values of a and b back into equation 1:\n\n1 + (-1) + c = 1\nc = 1\n\nNow we have the values of a, b, and c:\n\na = 1, b = -1, c = 1\n\nSo, the formula for the nth term of the sequence is:\n\nT(n) = n^2 - n + 1"
