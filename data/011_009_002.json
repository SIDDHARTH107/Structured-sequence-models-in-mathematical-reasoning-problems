    "message_2": "A partition of a set is a way of dividing the set into non-empty, non-overlapping subsets. The number of partitions of a set with n elements is given by the Bell number B(n). \n\nFor a set with 6 elements, we need to find the Bell number B(6). The first few Bell numbers are B(0) = 1, B(1) = 1, B(2) = 2, B(3) = 5, B(4) = 15, and B(5) = 52. \n\nThere are several ways to compute Bell numbers, but one common method is to use the Bell triangle. The Bell triangle is constructed by starting with B(0) in the first row, and then each subsequent row starts with the last number of the previous row. The other numbers in the row are obtained by adding the number to the left and the number above it.\n\nHere's the Bell triangle for the first few rows:\n\n1\n1  2\n2  3  5\n5  7 10 15\n15 20 27 37 52\n\nFrom the Bell triangle, we can see that B(6) is the last number in the next row. To find it, we can continue constructing the triangle:\n\n52 67 87 114 151 203\n\nSo, the number of different partitions for a set with 6 elements is B(6) = 203."
