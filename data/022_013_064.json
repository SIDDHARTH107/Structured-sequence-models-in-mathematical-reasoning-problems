    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1, we will differentiate each term with respect to z.\n\nThe derivative of z^2 with respect to z is 2z.\nThe derivative of 2z with respect to z is 2.\nThe derivative of 1 (a constant) with respect to z is 0.\n\nSo, the derivative of f(z) is: f'(z) = 2z + 2.\n\nNow, we will evaluate the derivative at the point z = 3 + i:\n\nf'(3 + i) = 2(3 + i) + 2\n= 6 + 2i + 2\n= 8 + 2i\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the function f(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1 at the point z = 3 + i is 8 + 2i."
