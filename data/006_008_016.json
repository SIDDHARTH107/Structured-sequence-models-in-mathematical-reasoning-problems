    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in a week)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (day), which is 0.3 in this case\n- n is the number of trials (days in a week), which is 7\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days), which we want at least 4\n\nSince we want the probability of at least 4 rainy days, we need to calculate the probabilities for 4, 5, 6, and 7 rainy days and sum them up.\n\nP(X ≥ 4) = P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7)\n\nLet's calculate each probability:\n\n1. P(X = 4):\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4!3!) = 35\nP(X = 4) = 35 * (0.3)^4 * (1-0.3)^(7-4) = 35 * (0.3)^4 * (0.7)^3 ≈ 0.2668\n\n2. P(X = 5):\nC(7, 5) = 7! / (5!2!) = 21\nP(X = 5) = 21 * (0.3)^5 * (1-0.3)^(7-5) = 21 * (0.3)^5 * (0.7)^2 ≈ 0.1029\n\n3. P(X = 6):\nC(7, 6) = 7! / (6!1!) = 7\nP(X = 6) = 7 * (0.3)^6 * (1-0.3)^(7-6) = 7 * (0.3)^6 * (0.7)^1 ≈ 0.0204\n\n4. P(X = 7):\nC(7, 7) = 7! / (7!0!) = 1\nP(X = 7) = 1 * (0.3)^7 * (1-0.3)^(7-7) = 1 * (0.3)^7 * (0.7)^0 ≈ 0.0016\n\nNow, let's sum up these probabilities:\n\nP(X ≥ 4) = 0.2668 + 0.1029 + 0.0204 + 0.0016 ≈ 0.3917\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least 4 rainy days out of a 7-day week is approximately 0.3917 or 39.17%."
