    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in epistemic logic:\n\nConsider two mathematicians, Alice and Bob, who are each given a number from the set {1, 2, 3}. Alice knows the sum of the two numbers, while Bob knows the product of the two numbers. They have the following conversation:\n\n- Alice: \"I don't know what your number is.\"\n- Bob: \"I already knew you didn't know.\"\n\nWhat are the possible numbers that Alice and Bob have been given?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the conversation step by step:\n\n1. Alice: \"I don't know what your number is.\"\nThis means that the sum of the numbers cannot be unique. If the sum was 4, then the only possible combination would be (1, 3) or (3, 1), and Alice would know Bob's number. So, the sum must be either 3 or 5. The possible combinations are:\n- (1, 2) with a sum of 3\n- (2, 1) with a sum of 3\n- (2, 3) with a sum of 5\n- (3, 2) with a sum of 5\n\n2. Bob: \"I already knew you didn't know.\"\nThis means that the product of the numbers cannot be unique. If the product was 2 or 3, then Bob would not be certain that Alice couldn't know his number. So, the product must be 1. The only possible combination is:\n- (1, 1) with a sum of 2 and a product of 1\n\nTherefore, the possible numbers that Alice and Bob have been given are both 1."
