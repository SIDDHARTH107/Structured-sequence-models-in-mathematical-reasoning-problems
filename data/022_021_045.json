    "message_2": "The Laplace transform of a function f(t) is defined as:\n\nL{f(t)} = F(s) = ∫[0,∞] e^(-st)f(t) dt\n\nWe are given the function f(t) = 2e^(3t)sin(4t). We want to find the Laplace transform of this function, so we will plug it into the definition:\n\nF(s) = ∫[0,∞] e^(-st) * 2e^(3t)sin(4t) dt\n\nTo make the integration easier, we can combine the exponential terms:\n\nF(s) = 2∫[0,∞] e^((3-s)t)sin(4t) dt\n\nNow, we will use integration by parts to solve this integral. Let:\n\nu = e^((3-s)t)\ndv = sin(4t) dt\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = (3-s)e^((3-s)t) dt\nv = -1/4 cos(4t)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\nF(s) = 2[-1/4 e^((3-s)t) cos(4t) |(0 to ∞) - ∫[0,∞] -1/4 (3-s)e^((3-s)t) cos(4t) dt]\n\nNow, let's evaluate the first term:\n\nlim (t→∞) [-1/4 e^((3-s)t) cos(4t)] - [-1/4 e^(0) cos(0)] = 0 - (-1/4) = 1/4\n\nSo, the first term is 1/4. Now, we need to solve the remaining integral:\n\n∫[0,∞] (3-s)e^((3-s)t) cos(4t) dt\n\nWe will use integration by parts again. Let:\n\nu = e^((3-s)t)\ndv = (3-s)cos(4t) dt\n\nThen, we have:\n\ndu = (3-s)^2 e^((3-s)t) dt\nv = 1/4 sin(4t)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula again:\n\n∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du\n\n= 1/4 e^((3-s)t) sin(4t) |(0 to ∞) - ∫[0,∞] 1/4 (3-s)^2 e^((3-s)t) sin(4t) dt\n\nEvaluating the first term:\n\nlim (t→∞) [1/4 e^((3-s)t) sin(4t)] - [1/4 e^(0) sin(0)] = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nSo, the first term is 0. Now, we have:\n\nF(s) = 2[1/4 - 0 - 1/2 ∫[0,∞] (3-s)^2 e^((3-s)t) sin(4t) dt]\n\nF(s) = 1/2 - ∫[0,∞] (3-s)^2 e^((3-s)t) sin(4t) dt\n\nNow, we have an integral that looks similar to the original integral. However, this new integral has a higher power of (3-s) in it. We can continue using integration by parts, but it will result in an infinite series. Instead, we can use the Laplace transform formula for the product of an exponential function and a sine function:\n\nL{e^(at)sin(bt)} = b / ((s-a)^2 + b^2)\n\nIn our case, a = 3-s and b = 4:\n\nF(s) = 4 / ((s-(3-s))^2 + 4^2)\n\nF(s) = 4 / ((2s-3)^2 + 16)\n\nSo, the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = 2e^(3t)sin(4t) is:\n\nF(s) = 4 / ((2s-3)^2 + 16)"
