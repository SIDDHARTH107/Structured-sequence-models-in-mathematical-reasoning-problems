    "message_2": "To prove that f is a smooth function, we need to show that for any point p in M, there exists a smooth chart (U, φ) around p such that f ◦ φ⁻¹ is a smooth function from φ(U) ⊂ ℝ² to ℝ.\n\nLet p be an arbitrary point in M. Since M is homeomorphic to the sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin in ℝ³, there exists a homeomorphism h: M → S², where S² is the unit sphere in ℝ³. Let (V, ψ) be a smooth chart around h(p) in S², i.e., ψ: V → ℝ² is a smooth diffeomorphism between an open neighborhood V of h(p) in S² and an open set ψ(V) in ℝ².\n\nNow, consider the chart (U, φ) around p in M, where U = h⁻¹(V) and φ = ψ ◦ h. Since h is a homeomorphism and ψ is a diffeomorphism, φ is also a diffeomorphism between U and φ(U) ⊂ ℝ².\n\nWe want to show that f ◦ φ⁻¹ is a smooth function from φ(U) to ℝ. Let x be an arbitrary point in φ(U). Then, there exists a point q in U such that φ(q) = x. We have:\n\nf ◦ φ⁻¹(x) = f(φ⁻¹(x)) = f(q) = ||q||².\n\nNow, let's express q in terms of x. Since φ(q) = x, we have q = h⁻¹(ψ⁻¹(x)). Thus,\n\nf ◦ φ⁻¹(x) = ||h⁻¹(ψ⁻¹(x))||².\n\nSince h is a homeomorphism between M and S², ||h⁻¹(ψ⁻¹(x))|| = 1 for all x in φ(U). Therefore, f ◦ φ⁻¹(x) = 1 for all x in φ(U), which is a constant function.\n\nA constant function is always smooth, so f ◦ φ⁻¹ is a smooth function from φ(U) to ℝ. Since p was an arbitrary point in M, we have shown that for any point p in M, there exists a smooth chart (U, φ) around p such that f ◦ φ⁻¹ is a smooth function from φ(U) to ℝ. Therefore, f is a smooth function on M."
