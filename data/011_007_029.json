    "message_1": "A manufacturer produces socks in three colors: black, white, and gray. Initially, the manufacturer has 2 pairs of black socks, 3 pairs of white socks, and 1 pair of gray socks. From each existing pair of socks, the manufacturer can produce a new pair of socks twice a week. Given this information, how many pairs of black socks will the manufacturer have in 4 weeks?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nInitially, the manufacturer has 2 pairs of black socks. They can produce a new pair of socks from each existing pair twice a week.\n\nSo, in one week, they can produce 2 (new pairs per existing pair) * 2 (initial pairs of black socks) = 4 new pairs of black socks.\n\nIn 4 weeks, they can produce 4 (new pairs per week) * 4 (weeks) = 16 new pairs of black socks.\n\nAdding the initial 2 pairs of black socks, the manufacturer will have a total of 16 (new pairs) + 2 (initial pairs) = 18 pairs of black socks in 4 weeks."
