    "message_1": "Suppose an insurance company has two investment options: Option A and Option B. Option A has an annual return of 8%, while Option B has an annual return of 12%. The insurance company wants to invest a total of $5,000,000 in these options, with no more than $4,000,000 in either option. \n\nIf the insurance company wants to maximize its annual return, how much money should it invest in each option?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the annual return, the insurance company should invest as much as possible in Option B, which has a higher return rate of 12%. However, they cannot invest more than $4,000,000 in either option. Therefore, they should invest $4,000,000 in Option B.\n\nSince the total investment must be $5,000,000, the remaining amount to be invested is $5,000,000 - $4,000,000 = $1,000,000. This amount should be invested in Option A.\n\nSo, the insurance company should invest $1,000,000 in Option A and $4,000,000 in Option B to maximize its annual return."
