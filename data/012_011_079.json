    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn graph G, the cut vertices are B, C, and D. Removing any of these vertices will increase the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nThe bridges in graph G are the edges (B, C) and (C, D). Removing either of these edges will increase the number of connected components in the graph."
