    "message_1": "Consider a Cournot competition where two companies, A and B, produce identical products. The demand function for the product is given by P = 100 - Q, where P is the price and Q is the total quantity produced by both companies. The cost function for each company is C(Q) = 2Q.\n\nWhat will be the equilibrium quantity produced by each company and the market price in this Cournot competition?",
    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium quantity produced by each company and the market price in this Cournot competition, we first need to find the reaction functions for both companies. The reaction function shows the optimal quantity a company should produce given the quantity produced by the other company.\n\nLet qA and qB be the quantities produced by companies A and B, respectively. The total quantity produced, Q, is given by Q = qA + qB. The profit function for each company is given by π = PQ - C(Q), where π is the profit, P is the price, and C(Q) is the cost function.\n\nFor company A, the profit function is:\n\nπA = PqA - C(qA) = (100 - Q)qA - 2qA = (100 - (qA + qB))qA - 2qA\n\nTo find the reaction function for company A, we need to maximize its profit function with respect to qA. To do this, we take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to qA and set it equal to 0:\n\ndπA/dqA = (100 - 2qA - qB) - 2 = 0\n\nSolving for qA, we get the reaction function for company A:\n\nqA = (98 - qB)/2\n\nSimilarly, for company B, the profit function is:\n\nπB = PqB - C(qB) = (100 - Q)qB - 2qB = (100 - (qA + qB))qB - 2qB\n\nTaking the first derivative with respect to qB and setting it equal to 0:\n\ndπB/dqB = (100 - qA - 2qB) - 2 = 0\n\nSolving for qB, we get the reaction function for company B:\n\nqB = (98 - qA)/2\n\nNow, we can solve for the equilibrium quantities by setting the reaction functions equal to each other:\n\n(98 - qB)/2 = (98 - qA)/2\n\nSince both sides are equal, we can set qA = qB. Let q* be the equilibrium quantity for both companies:\n\nq* = (98 - q*)/2\n\nSolving for q*, we get:\n\n2q* = 98 - q*\n\n3q* = 98\n\nq* ≈ 32.67\n\nSo, the equilibrium quantity produced by each company is approximately 32.67 units. Now, we can find the market price by plugging the equilibrium quantities back into the demand function:\n\nP = 100 - Q = 100 - (qA + qB) = 100 - (32.67 + 32.67) ≈ 100 - 65.34 ≈ 34.66\n\nThus, the equilibrium market price in this Cournot competition is approximately $34.66."
