    "message_2": "To show that the sequence {xn} converges to 0 in the topological space X, we need to use the definition of convergence in topology. A sequence {xn} converges to a point x in a topological space X if for every open neighborhood U of x, there exists a natural number N such that for all n > N, xn ∈ U.\n\nLet x = 0, and let U be an open neighborhood of 0 in X. Since X is a subset of the real numbers, we can use the standard topology on the real numbers, which means that open neighborhoods of 0 are open intervals of the form (-ε, ε) for some ε > 0. Note that since X = [0,1], we can assume that ε ≤ 1.\n\nNow, we need to find a natural number N such that for all n > N, xn = 1/n ∈ U. Since 1/n > 0 for all n, we know that xn > 0 for all n. We want to find an N such that 1/n < ε for all n > N. \n\nBy the Archimedean property of the real numbers, for any ε > 0, there exists a natural number N such that 1/N < ε. Thus, for all n > N, we have 1/n ≤ 1/N < ε. This means that xn = 1/n ∈ (-ε, ε) for all n > N.\n\nTherefore, by the definition of convergence in topology, the sequence {xn} converges to 0 in the topological space X."
