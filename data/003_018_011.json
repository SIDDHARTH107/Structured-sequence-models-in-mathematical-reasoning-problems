    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x) - 4cos(x), we'll first find the derivative of each term with respect to x, and then evaluate the derivative at x = π/4.\n\nDerivative of 3sin(2x) with respect to x:\nUsing the chain rule, we have d/dx[3sin(2x)] = 3 * d/dx[sin(2x)] * d/dx[2x].\nThe derivative of sin(2x) with respect to 2x is cos(2x), and the derivative of 2x with respect to x is 2. So, d/dx[3sin(2x)] = 3 * cos(2x) * 2 = 6cos(2x).\n\nDerivative of -4cos(x) with respect to x:\nThe derivative of cos(x) with respect to x is -sin(x), so d/dx[-4cos(x)] = -4 * -sin(x) = 4sin(x).\n\nNow, we can find the derivative of the entire function:\nf'(x) = 6cos(2x) + 4sin(x).\n\nNow, we'll evaluate the derivative at x = π/4:\nf'(π/4) = 6cos(2(π/4)) + 4sin(π/4)\nf'(π/4) = 6cos(π/2) + 4sin(π/4)\nf'(π/4) = 6(0) + 4(√2/2)\nf'(π/4) = 4(√2/2)\nf'(π/4) = 2√2\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x) - 4cos(x) at x = π/4 is 2√2."
