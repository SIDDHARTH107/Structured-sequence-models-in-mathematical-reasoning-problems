    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4πr²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 8 cm, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4π(8²)\n\nSurface Area = 4π(64)\n\nSurface Area = 256π\n\nThe surface area of the sphere is 256π square centimeters."
