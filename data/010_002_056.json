    "message_2": "To show that {xn} is a Cauchy sequence in X, we need to prove that for every ε > 0, there exists an N ∈ ℕ such that for all n, m ∈ ℕ with n, m ≥ N, we have d(xn, xm) < ε.\n\nHowever, this is exactly the condition given in the problem statement. We are told that for every ε > 0, there exists an N ∈ ℕ such that d(xn, xm) < ε for all n, m ∈ ℕ satisfying n, m ≥ N.\n\nTherefore, the sequence {xn} is a Cauchy sequence in X by definition."
