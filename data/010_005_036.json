    "message_2": "First, let's visualize the set $S$. The condition $x^2 + y^2 \\le 4$ represents all points inside or on the circle with radius 2 centered at the origin. The condition $|x| \\le 1$ represents all points between the vertical lines $x = -1$ and $x = 1$. Therefore, the set $S$ consists of the intersection of these two regions, which is a \"slice\" of the circle between the two vertical lines.\n\nNow, let's consider the connectedness and path-connectedness of $S$.\n\nConnectedness: A set is connected if it cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty open subsets. In this case, it is clear that $S$ is connected, as there is no way to divide the \"slice\" of the circle into two disjoint nonempty open subsets. Any open subset of $S$ that contains a point on the boundary of the circle will also contain points inside the circle, and any open subset of $S$ that contains a point inside the circle will also contain points on the boundary of the circle.\n\nPath-connectedness: A set is path-connected if for any two points in the set, there exists a continuous path between them that lies entirely within the set. To show that $S$ is path-connected, consider any two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in $S$. Since both points lie within the \"slice\" of the circle, we can construct a continuous path between them by connecting them with a straight line segment. This line segment will lie entirely within $S$, as it is contained within the intersection of the circle and the vertical lines. Therefore, $S$ is path-connected.\n\nIn conclusion, the set $S$ is both connected and path-connected."
