    "message_2": "To compute the second de Rham cohomology group of the complement of the triangle in ℝ², we can use the fact that the de Rham cohomology groups are isomorphic to the singular cohomology groups with real coefficients.\n\nThe complement of the triangle in ℝ² is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of three circles (one for each edge of the triangle). To see this, imagine collapsing each edge of the triangle to a point, which results in a wedge sum of three circles.\n\nNow, we can compute the singular cohomology groups of this space. The second singular cohomology group of a bouquet of three circles is trivial, as the second homology group of a circle is trivial and the second homology group of a wedge sum is the direct sum of the second homology groups of the individual spaces.\n\nTherefore, the second de Rham cohomology group of the complement of the triangle in ℝ² is trivial, i.e., H^2 = {0}."
