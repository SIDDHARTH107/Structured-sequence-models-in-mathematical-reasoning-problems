    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE) using the finite element method (FEM), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Discretize the spatial domain and define the basis functions.\n2. Formulate the weak form of the PDE.\n3. Discretize the time domain and apply the time-stepping scheme.\n4. Assemble the global system of equations and solve for the unknown function at each time step.\n5. Evaluate the numerical solution at t = 1.\n\nStep 1: Discretize the spatial domain and define the basis functions\nWe are given a uniform grid with h = 0.1, so we have x_i = i * h for i = 0, 1, ..., 10. We will use linear piecewise basis functions, which are defined as:\n\nϕ_i(x) = (x - x_(i-1))/h for x_(i-1) <= x <= x_i\nϕ_i(x) = (x_(i+1) - x)/h for x_i <= x <= x_(i+1)\nϕ_i(x) = 0 otherwise\n\nStep 2: Formulate the weak form of the PDE\nWe multiply the PDE by a test function v(x) and integrate over the spatial domain [0, 1]:\n\n∫(∂(u)/∂(t) * v(x) - 2∂^2(u)/∂(x^2) * v(x) - cos(pi*t)*sin(pi*x) * v(x)) dx = 0\n\nStep 3: Discretize the time domain and apply the time-stepping scheme\nWe are given a uniform time grid with k = 0.01, so we have t_n = n * k for n = 0, 1, ..., 100. We will use the backward Euler method for time discretization:\n\nu^(n+1) = u^n + k * ∂(u^(n+1))/∂(t)\n\nSubstituting this into the weak form and using the basis functions for u and v, we get a system of linear equations:\n\nA * U^(n+1) = B * U^n + F^n\n\nwhere A and B are matrices, U^n is the vector of nodal values of u at time t_n, and F^n is the vector of nodal values of the forcing term at time t_n.\n\nStep 4: Assemble the global system of equations and solve for the unknown function at each time step\nWe will use the initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(pi*x) to compute U^0 and then solve the system of linear equations at each time step to obtain U^(n+1).\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the numerical solution at t = 1\nAfter solving for U^100, we can use the basis functions to compute the numerical solution u(x, 1) = ∑ U^100_i * ϕ_i(x).\n\nNote that the actual implementation of the finite element method requires the computation of the matrices A and B, the assembly of the global system of equations, and the solution of the linear system at each time step. This is typically done using specialized software or libraries."
