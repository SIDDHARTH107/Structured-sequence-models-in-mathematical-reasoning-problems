    "message_1": "Consider the two types of sets A and B, where A has 5 elements and B has 8 elements. If we define a function f that maps each element of A to exactly one element of B, how many possible functions can we create?",
    "message_2": "To determine the number of possible functions, we can use the concept of counting. For each element in set A, there are 8 choices in set B to map it to. Since there are 5 elements in set A, the total number of possible functions can be calculated as:\n\n8 choices for the 1st element of A * 8 choices for the 2nd element of A * 8 choices for the 3rd element of A * 8 choices for the 4th element of A * 8 choices for the 5th element of A\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n8^5 = 32,768\n\nSo, there are 32,768 possible functions that can be created by mapping each element of set A to exactly one element of set B."
