    "message_2": "The Gosper curve, also known as the Gosper Island or the flowsnake, is a fractal curve that increases its length with each iteration. The ratio of the perimeter of one iteration to the previous iteration is constant.\n\nFor the Gosper curve, this ratio is 7/3. Therefore, the ratio of the perimeter of the 4th iteration to the perimeter of the 3rd iteration is also 7/3."
