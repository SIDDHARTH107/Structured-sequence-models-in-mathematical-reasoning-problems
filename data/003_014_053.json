    "message_2": "a) To write the equation for the height, h, of the person above the ground as a function of time, t, in minutes, we can use the sinusoidal function:\n\nh(t) = A * sin(B * (t - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B is the angular frequency, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nIn this case, the amplitude (A) is half the diameter of the Ferris wheel, which is 25 meters. The angular frequency (B) can be found by multiplying the rate of rotation (0.1 revolutions per minute) by 2π, which gives 0.2π radians per minute. There is no phase shift (C = 0) since the person starts at the lowest point of the Ferris wheel. The vertical shift (D) is the height of the lowest point, which is 2 meters.\n\nSo the equation for the height of the person above the ground as a function of time is:\n\nh(t) = 25 * sin(0.2π * t) + 27\n\nb) The maximum and minimum heights that the person reaches while on the Ferris wheel can be found by adding and subtracting the amplitude from the vertical shift:\n\nMaximum height: 27 + 25 = 52 meters\nMinimum height: 27 - 25 = 2 meters\n\nc) To find the times at which the person is at a height of 25 meters above the ground, we can set h(t) equal to 25 and solve for t:\n\n25 = 25 * sin(0.2π * t) + 27\n\nSubtract 27 from both sides:\n\n-2 = 25 * sin(0.2π * t)\n\nDivide by 25:\n\n-0.08 = sin(0.2π * t)\n\nNow, we can find the inverse sine (arcsin) of -0.08:\n\narcsin(-0.08) = -0.2π * t\n\nDivide by -0.2π:\n\nt ≈ 0.127 / π ≈ 0.0404 minutes\n\nSince the Ferris wheel completes a full rotation in 10 minutes (1 / 0.1), we can find the second time by subtracting 0.0404 from 10:\n\nt ≈ 10 - 0.0404 ≈ 9.9596 minutes\n\nSo, the person is at a height of 25 meters above the ground at approximately 0.0404 and 9.9596 minutes."
