    "message_2": "To compute the dimension of the space of global sections of L, we will use the Riemann-Roch theorem for curves. The Riemann-Roch theorem states that for a divisor D on a smooth curve X of genus g, we have:\n\nh⁰(X, L) - h⁰(X, K - L) = deg(D) + 1 - g,\n\nwhere K is the canonical divisor on X, and deg(D) is the degree of the divisor D.\n\nFirst, we need to find the genus g of the curve X. Since X is a smooth plane curve of degree 3, we can use the formula for the genus of a smooth plane curve:\n\ng = (d - 1)(d - 2)/2,\n\nwhere d is the degree of the curve. In our case, d = 3, so:\n\ng = (3 - 1)(3 - 2)/2 = 2(1)/2 = 1.\n\nNow we need to find the degree of the divisor D. The divisor D is given by D = (1, 1) - (-1, -1). Since both points have multiplicity 1, the degree of D is the sum of the multiplicities, which is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNext, we need to find the canonical divisor K. For a smooth plane curve of degree d, the canonical divisor is given by:\n\nK = (d - 3)(d - 2)/2,\n\nIn our case, d = 3, so:\n\nK = (3 - 3)(3 - 2)/2 = 0(1)/2 = 0.\n\nNow we can apply the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n\nh⁰(X, L) - h⁰(X, K - L) = deg(D) + 1 - g.\n\nSince K = 0, we have K - L = -L. Also, deg(D) = 2 and g = 1, so:\n\nh⁰(X, L) - h⁰(X, -L) = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2.\n\nNow we need to find h⁰(X, -L). Since L is associated to the divisor D, -L is associated to the divisor -D. The degree of -D is -2, which is negative. A line bundle associated to a divisor of negative degree has no global sections, so h⁰(X, -L) = 0.\n\nFinally, we have:\n\nh⁰(X, L) = 2.\n\nSo the dimension of the space of global sections of L is 2."
