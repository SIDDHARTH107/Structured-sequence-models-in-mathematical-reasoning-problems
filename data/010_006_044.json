    "message_2": "Since $X$ is homeomorphic to $S^2 \\times S^1$, their fundamental groups will be isomorphic. To compute the fundamental group of $S^2 \\times S^1$, we can use the fact that the fundamental group of a product space is the direct product of the fundamental groups of the individual spaces.\n\nThe fundamental group of $S^2$ is trivial, i.e., $\\pi_1(S^2) = \\{e\\}$, because $S^2$ is simply connected. The fundamental group of $S^1$ is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., $\\pi_1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$, because $S^1$ is a circle with one \"hole\" and loops around it can be classified by the number of times they wind around the hole.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of $S^2 \\times S^1$ is the direct product of the fundamental groups of $S^2$ and $S^1$, which is $\\{e\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, the fundamental group of the topological space $X$ is $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
