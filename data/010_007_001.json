    "message_1": "Let X be a path-connected space with fundamental group π(X, x₀) where x₀ is a base point, and let p: Y → X be a covering map. Suppose that there exists a base point y₀ in p^{-1}(x₀) such that π(Y, y₀) is isomorphic to the group G of order 36. What are the possible isomorphism classes of the covering space p: Y → X?",
    "message_2": "To determine the possible isomorphism classes of the covering space p: Y → X, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. The fundamental group of a covering space is a subgroup of the fundamental group of the base space.\n2. The order of the subgroup π(Y, y₀) divides the order of the group π(X, x₀).\n3. The number of sheets in the covering space is equal to the index of the subgroup π(Y, y₀) in π(X, x₀).\n\nSince π(Y, y₀) is isomorphic to the group G of order 36, we know that the order of π(Y, y₀) is 36. Therefore, the order of π(X, x₀) must be a multiple of 36. Let's denote the order of π(X, x₀) as n * 36, where n is a positive integer.\n\nNow, we will consider the possible prime factorizations of 36:\n\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n\nThe possible subgroups of G can be determined by the divisors of 36:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36\n\nFor each divisor d, there exists a subgroup of G with order d. Since the covering space Y has a fundamental group isomorphic to G, the possible isomorphism classes of the covering space p: Y → X correspond to the possible subgroups of G.\n\nTherefore, the possible isomorphism classes of the covering space p: Y → X are:\n\n1. Trivial covering (order 1): X is homeomorphic to Y, and π(X, x₀) is isomorphic to G.\n2. Order 2: π(X, x₀) has a subgroup of order 18.\n3. Order 3: π(X, x₀) has a subgroup of order 12.\n4. Order 4: π(X, x₀) has a subgroup of order 9.\n5. Order 6: π(X, x₀) has a subgroup of order 6.\n6. Order 9: π(X, x₀) has a subgroup of order 4.\n7. Order 12: π(X, x₀) has a subgroup of order 3.\n8. Order 18: π(X, x₀) has a subgroup of order 2.\n9. Order 36: π(X, x₀) is isomorphic to G.\n\nThese are the possible isomorphism classes of the covering space p: Y → X, depending on the structure of the fundamental group π(X, x₀) and its subgroups."
