    "message_2": "To find the optimal solution, we first need to analyze the constraints and the positive semi-definite matrix condition.\n\n1. x1 + x2 ≤ 1\n2. x1 - 2x2 ≤ 2\n3. x1 ≥ 0, x2 ≥ 0\n4. [x1^2, x1x2; x1x2, x2^2] is a positive semi-definite matrix.\n\nFor a matrix to be positive semi-definite, all its eigenvalues must be non-negative. The eigenvalues of the given matrix are:\n\nλ1 = (x1^2 + x2^2)/2 + sqrt((x1^2 - x2^2)^2 + 4(x1x2)^2)/2\nλ2 = (x1^2 + x2^2)/2 - sqrt((x1^2 - x2^2)^2 + 4(x1x2)^2)/2\n\nSince x1 and x2 are non-negative, λ1 will always be non-negative. We need to ensure that λ2 is also non-negative:\n\nλ2 = (x1^2 + x2^2)/2 - sqrt((x1^2 - x2^2)^2 + 4(x1x2)^2)/2 ≥ 0\n\nThis inequality holds if and only if:\n\n(x1^2 - x2^2)^2 + 4(x1x2)^2 ≤ (x1^2 + x2^2)^2\n\nThis inequality is always true, so the positive semi-definite constraint is satisfied for all x1, x2 ≥ 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal solution within the feasible region defined by the constraints. We can visualize the feasible region by plotting the constraints:\n\n1. x1 + x2 ≤ 1: This is a line with slope -1 and y-intercept 1. The feasible region is below this line.\n2. x1 - 2x2 ≤ 2: This is a line with slope 1/2 and y-intercept 1. The feasible region is below this line.\n3. x1 ≥ 0, x2 ≥ 0: This constraint defines the first quadrant.\n\nThe feasible region is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 1), and (2/3, 1/3). Since the objective function is to maximize x1 + x2, the optimal solution will be at the vertex with the largest sum of x1 and x2. In this case, the optimal solution is at the vertex (2/3, 1/3), with an optimal value of x1 + x2 = 2/3 + 1/3 = 1."
