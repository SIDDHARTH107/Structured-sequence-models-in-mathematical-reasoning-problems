    "message_2": "To find the equation of the sinusoidal function, we need to determine the values of A, B, C, and D in the general equation:\n\ny = A * sin(B(x - C)) + D\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, B determines the period, C is the phase shift, and D is the vertical shift.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n1. Amplitude (A) = 4\n2. Period = π/2\n3. Phase shift (C) = π/6\n4. There is no mention of a vertical shift, so we can assume D = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of B. The period of a sinusoidal function is given by the formula:\n\nPeriod = 2π/B\n\nWe are given the period as π/2, so we can set up the equation:\n\nπ/2 = 2π/B\n\nTo solve for B, we can multiply both sides by B and then divide by π/2:\n\nB(π/2) = 2π\nB = 4\n\nNow we have all the values we need to write the equation of the sinusoidal function:\n\ny = 4 * sin(4(x - π/6))"
