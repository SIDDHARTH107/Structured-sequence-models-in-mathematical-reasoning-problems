    "message_2": "The volume V of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the radius r = 7 cm, we can calculate the volume as follows:\n\nV = (4/3)π(7³)\nV = (4/3)π(343)\nV = 4 * 343π / 3\nV ≈ 1436.03 cm³\n\nThe volume of the sphere with a radius of 7 cm is approximately 1436.03 cubic centimeters."
