    "message_2": "To calculate the treewidth of the given graph G, we first need to find a tree decomposition of the graph. A tree decomposition is a tree where each node is a bag containing a subset of vertices from the graph, and the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The union of all bags is equal to the set of vertices of the graph.\n2. For each edge (u, v) in the graph, there exists a bag containing both u and v.\n3. For each vertex v in the graph, the bags containing v form a connected subtree.\n\nA possible tree decomposition for the given graph G is:\n\n       {1,2,5}\n         |\n       {1,2,3}\n         |\n       {2,3,6}\n         |\n       {3,4,6}\n         |\n       {3,4,7}\n\nThe treewidth of a tree decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus 1. In this case, the largest bag has 3 vertices, so the treewidth of the given graph G is 3 - 1 = 2."
