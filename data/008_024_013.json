    "message_2": "First, we can notice that the second and third equations are just multiples of the first equation. We can divide the second equation by 2 and the third equation by 3 to see this more clearly:\n\n1. x + 2y - z = 5\n2. x + 2y - z = 5 (after dividing the second equation by 2)\n3. x + 2y - z = 5 (after dividing the third equation by 3)\n\nNow, we can see that all three equations are the same. This means that the system of equations has infinitely many solutions, as any solution that satisfies one equation will satisfy all three.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can express one variable in terms of the other two. For example, we can express x in terms of y and z:\n\nx = 5 - 2y + z\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as:\n\n(x, y, z) = (5 - 2y + z, y, z)\n\nHere, y and z can be any real numbers, and x will be determined by the values of y and z."
