    "message_1": "A candy company claims that their bags of candies contain 300 grams of candies on average with a standard deviation of 15 grams. A math student wants to determine if this claim is true. What is the 95% confidence interval for the true average weight of candies in the company's bags based on a sample of 25 bags that have a mean weight of 305 grams?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true average weight of candies in the company's bags, we will use the following formula:\n\nConfidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * Standard Error)\n\nIn this case, the sample mean is 305 grams, the critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table), and the standard error is calculated as:\n\nStandard Error = (Population Standard Deviation) / sqrt(Sample Size)\n\nStandard Error = (15 grams) / sqrt(25) = 15 grams / 5 = 3 grams\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence interval:\n\nConfidence Interval = 305 grams ± (1.96 * 3 grams)\n\nConfidence Interval = 305 grams ± 5.88 grams\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the true average weight of candies in the company's bags is approximately (299.12 grams, 310.88 grams)."
