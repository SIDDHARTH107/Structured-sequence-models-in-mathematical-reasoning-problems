    "message_1": "A student is asked to analyze the stability of a mechanical system given by the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 7 using Fourier transform. The system's response is defined as the convolution of the function f(x) with an impulse response function h(x) = e^-x u(x), where u(x) is the unit step function. Using the Fourier transform, find the frequency response function H(jw) of the system and determine if the system is stable, marginally stable or unstable.",
    "message_2": "To find the frequency response function H(jw), we first need to find the Fourier transform of the impulse response function h(x). Recall that the Fourier transform of a function g(x) is given by:\n\nG(jw) = ∫[g(x) * e^(-jwx)] dx\n\nNow, let's find the Fourier transform of h(x) = e^(-x)u(x):\n\nH(jw) = ∫[e^(-x)u(x) * e^(-jwx)] dx\n       = ∫[e^(-x) * e^(-jwx)] dx (from 0 to ∞, since u(x) is 0 for x < 0)\n\nNow, combine the exponentials:\n\nH(jw) = ∫[e^(-x(1 + jw))] dx (from 0 to ∞)\n\nThis is an integral of the form ∫[e^(-ax)] dx, which evaluates to -1/a * e^(-ax) (from 0 to ∞). In our case, a = 1 + jw:\n\nH(jw) = -1/(1 + jw) * e^(-(1 + jw)x) (from 0 to ∞)\n\nNow, evaluate the limits:\n\nH(jw) = -1/(1 + jw) * [e^(-∞) - e^(0)]\n       = -1/(1 + jw) * [0 - 1]\n       = 1/(1 + jw)\n\nNow that we have the frequency response function H(jw), we can analyze the stability of the system. A system is stable if its impulse response function h(x) is absolutely integrable, which means that the integral of the absolute value of h(x) converges:\n\n∫|h(x)| dx = ∫|e^(-x)u(x)| dx (from -∞ to ∞)\n\nSince u(x) is 0 for x < 0, the integral becomes:\n\n∫|e^(-x)| dx (from 0 to ∞)\n\nThis integral converges because the exponential function e^(-x) decays to 0 as x goes to infinity. Therefore, the system is stable.\n\nIn conclusion, the frequency response function H(jw) of the system is H(jw) = 1/(1 + jw), and the system is stable."
