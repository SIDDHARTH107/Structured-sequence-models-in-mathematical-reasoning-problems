    "message_2": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 24, 36, and 42, we first need to find the prime factors of each number:\n\n24 = 2^3 * 3^1\n36 = 2^2 * 3^2\n42 = 2^1 * 3^1 * 7^1\n\nNow, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:\n\n2^3, 3^2, and 7^1\n\nFinally, we multiply these prime factors together to get the LCM:\n\nLCM(24, 36, 42) = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7^1 = 8 * 9 * 7 = 504\n\nSo, the LCM of 24, 36, and 42 is 504."
