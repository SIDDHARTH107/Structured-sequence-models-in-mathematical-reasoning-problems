    "message_1": "Suppose that a company has 1000 employees, and the probability of any individual employee committing financial fraud is 0.02. What is the probability that at least 20 employees in the company have committed financial fraud?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The probability of at least 20 employees committing financial fraud is equal to 1 minus the probability of fewer than 20 employees committing financial fraud.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k employees committing financial fraud\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- n is the total number of employees (1000)\n- k is the number of employees committing financial fraud\n- p is the probability of an individual employee committing financial fraud (0.02)\n- 1-p is the probability of an individual employee not committing financial fraud (0.98)\n\nWe want to find the probability of at least 20 employees committing financial fraud, which is equal to 1 minus the probability of fewer than 20 employees committing financial fraud:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - P(X < 20) = 1 - Σ[P(X = k)] for k = 0 to 19\n\nNow, we can calculate the sum of the probabilities for k = 0 to 19:\n\nΣ[P(X = k)] = Σ[C(1000, k) * 0.02^k * 0.98^(1000-k)] for k = 0 to 19\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the sum, we get:\n\nΣ[P(X = k)] ≈ 0.5595\n\nNow, we can find the probability of at least 20 employees committing financial fraud:\n\nP(X >= 20) = 1 - Σ[P(X = k)] ≈ 1 - 0.5595 ≈ 0.4405\n\nSo, the probability that at least 20 employees in the company have committed financial fraud is approximately 0.4405 or 44.05%."
