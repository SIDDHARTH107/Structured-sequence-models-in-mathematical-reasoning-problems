    "message_2": "To find the radius of convergence, we can use the Ratio Test. The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of a series is less than 1, then the series converges. In this case, we have:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}(x-2)^{n+1}}{(n+1)^2+1}}{\\frac{(-1)^n(x-2)^n}{n^2+1}}\\right|$$\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{(n^2+1)(x-2)}{(n+1)^2+1}\\right|$$\n\nNow, we want this limit to be less than 1 for convergence:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{(n^2+1)(x-2)}{(n+1)^2+1}\\right| < 1$$\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the dominating terms are $n^2$ in both the numerator and the denominator. Therefore, we can rewrite the limit as:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{n^2(x-2)}{(n+1)^2}\\right| < 1$$\n\nSimplify further:\n\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left|\\frac{(x-2)}{(1+\\frac{1}{n})^2}\\right| < 1$$\n\nSince the limit does not depend on n, we can remove the limit notation:\n\n$$|(x-2)| < 1$$\n\nThis inequality gives us the interval of convergence:\n\n$$1 < x-2 < 3$$\n\nAdding 2 to all sides:\n\n$$3 < x < 5$$\n\nThe radius of convergence is half the length of the interval of convergence:\n\n$$R = \\frac{5 - 3}{2} = 1$$\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval to see if the series converges at x = 3 and x = 5. \n\nFor x = 3, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(-1)^n(1)^n}{n^2+1} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(-1)^n}{n^2+1}$$\n\nThis is an alternating series, and since the terms $\\frac{1}{n^2+1}$ are positive, decreasing, and approaching 0 as n approaches infinity, the Alternating Series Test tells us that the series converges at x = 3.\n\nFor x = 5, the series becomes:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\frac{(-1)^n(3)^n}{n^2+1}$$\n\nThis series does not converge, as the terms do not approach 0 as n approaches infinity.\n\nThus, the interval of convergence is $[3, 5)$, and the radius of convergence is 1."
