    "message_2": "To solve the equation $2^{x} - 5(2^{x-1}) = 6$, we can first factor out a $2^{x-1}$ term:\n\n$2^{x-1}(2 - 5) = 6$\n\nNow we can simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n$2^{x-1}(-3) = 6$\n\nNext, we can divide both sides of the equation by $-3$:\n\n$2^{x-1} = -2$\n\nSince the left side of the equation represents an exponential function with a positive base, it can never be equal to a negative number. Therefore, there is no solution for x in this equation."
