    "message_2": "To find the residue of the function f(z) = (z^2 - 1)^2 / (z - 2)^3 at z = 2, we can use the method of differentiation. Since the pole is of order 3, we will need to differentiate the numerator twice and evaluate the result at z = 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the first and second derivatives of the numerator (z^2 - 1)^2:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 1)^2\nf'(z) = 2(z^2 - 1)(2z) = 4z(z^2 - 1)\nf''(z) = 4(z^2 - 1) + 8z^2 = 12z^2 - 4\n\nNow, we can evaluate the second derivative at z = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 12(2)^2 - 4 = 48 - 4 = 44\n\nNext, we need to find the third derivative of the denominator (z - 2)^3:\n\ng(z) = (z - 2)^3\ng'(z) = 3(z - 2)^2\ng''(z) = 6(z - 2)\ng'''(z) = 6\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the residue of a function with a pole of order 3:\n\nResidue = (f''(2) * g(2) - f(2) * g'''(2)) / g'(2)^2\n\nFirst, let's find the values of f(2) and g(2):\n\nf(2) = (2^2 - 1)^2 = (3)^2 = 9\ng(2) = (2 - 2)^3 = 0\n\nSince g(2) = 0, the first term in the numerator of the formula becomes 0. Now, we can plug in the remaining values:\n\nResidue = (0 - 9 * 6) / (3 * (2 - 2)^2)^2 = (-54) / 0\n\nHowever, we cannot divide by zero. This indicates that there is an error in the problem statement or the method used. In this case, the error is in the method used, as the residue formula is not applicable for this specific function.\n\nInstead, we can find the residue by performing a Taylor series expansion of the function f(z) around z = 2:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 - 1)^2 / (z - 2)^3\n\nLet h(z) = (z^2 - 1)^2. Then, f(z) = h(z) / (z - 2)^3. We can expand h(z) as a Taylor series around z = 2:\n\nh(z) = h(2) + h'(2)(z - 2) + (1/2)h''(2)(z - 2)^2 + ...\n\nWe already found h'(2) and h''(2) earlier:\n\nh'(2) = 4z(z^2 - 1) = 4(2)(2^2 - 1) = 12\nh''(2) = 12z^2 - 4 = 12(2)^2 - 4 = 44\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Taylor series expansion:\n\nh(z) = 9 + 12(z - 2) + (1/2)(44)(z - 2)^2 + ...\n\nNow, we can divide h(z) by (z - 2)^3 term by term:\n\nf(z) = (9 / (z - 2)^3) + (12 / (z - 2)^2) + (22 / (z - 2)) + ...\n\nThe residue of f(z) at z = 2 is the coefficient of the 1 / (z - 2) term in the Taylor series expansion, which is 22. Therefore, the residue of the function f(z) at z = 2 is 22."
