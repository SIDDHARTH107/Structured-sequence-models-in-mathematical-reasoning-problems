    "message_1": "A toy company has to ship 80 toy cars and 100 toy trucks in 4 trucks. Each truck can carry 30 toys. What is the minimum number of trucks the company needs to transport all the toys?",
    "message_2": "First, we need to find the total number of toys that need to be transported: 80 toy cars + 100 toy trucks = 180 toys.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many trucks are needed to transport all the toys. Since each truck can carry 30 toys, we can divide the total number of toys by the capacity of each truck: 180 toys รท 30 toys/truck = 6 trucks.\n\nTherefore, the company needs a minimum of 6 trucks to transport all the toys."
