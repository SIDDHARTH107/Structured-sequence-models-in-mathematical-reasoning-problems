    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 10 cm and the length of its parallel sides are 12 cm and 16 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the two non-parallel sides a and b.\n\nWe can divide the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side. This line will be the height of the trapezium, which is 10 cm.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles. One with a base of 12 cm and a height of 10 cm, and the other with a base of (16 - 12) = 4 cm and a height of 10 cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the other two sides (a and b).\n\nFor the first triangle:\na^2 = 10^2 + 12^2\na^2 = 100 + 144\na^2 = 244\na = √244 ≈ 15.62 cm\n\nFor the second triangle:\nb^2 = 10^2 + 4^2\nb^2 = 100 + 16\nb^2 = 116\nb = √116 ≈ 10.77 cm\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\nPerimeter = 12 cm + 16 cm + 15.62 cm + 10.77 cm ≈ 54.39 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the trapezium is approximately 54.39 cm."
