    "message_2": "To apply the Newton-Raphson method, we first need to find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x - 4. The derivative f'(x) = 3x^2 + 6x + 4.\n\nThe Newton-Raphson formula is: x1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)\n\nWe start with an initial guess of x0 = 1.5 and iteratively improve the approximation until the relative error is less than or equal to 0.01%.\n\nIteration 1:\nx1 = 1.5 - (1.5^3 + 3(1.5)^2 + 4(1.5) - 4) / (3(1.5)^2 + 6(1.5) + 4)\nx1 = 1.5 - (3.375 + 6.75 + 6 - 4) / (6.75 + 9 + 4)\nx1 = 1.5 - (12.125) / (19.75)\nx1 ≈ 1.089\n\nRelative error = |(1.089 - 1.5) / 1.089| * 100% ≈ 37.7%\n\nIteration 2:\nx2 = 1.089 - (1.089^3 + 3(1.089)^2 + 4(1.089) - 4) / (3(1.089)^2 + 6(1.089) + 4)\nx2 ≈ 1.027\n\nRelative error = |(1.027 - 1.089) / 1.027| * 100% ≈ 6.03%\n\nIteration 3:\nx3 = 1.027 - (1.027^3 + 3(1.027)^2 + 4(1.027) - 4) / (3(1.027)^2 + 6(1.027) + 4)\nx3 ≈ 1.023\n\nRelative error = |(1.023 - 1.027) / 1.023| * 100% ≈ 0.391%\n\nThe relative error is now less than or equal to 0.01%. Therefore, the root of the equation f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x - 4 using the Newton-Raphson method is approximately x ≈ 1.023 (rounded to three decimal places)."
