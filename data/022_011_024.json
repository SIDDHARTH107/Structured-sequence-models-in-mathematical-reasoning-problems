    "message_2": "To find the order, multiplicity, and location of the pole of the function f(z) = (z - 2)^4 / (z + 1)^3, we first need to identify the singularities of the function. In this case, the singularities occur when the denominator is equal to zero, i.e., (z + 1)^3 = 0.\n\nSolving for z, we get z = -1. So, the location of the pole is at z = -1.\n\nNow, let's find the order of the pole. The order of the pole is determined by the exponent of the factor (z + 1) in the denominator. In this case, the exponent is 3. Therefore, the order of the pole is 3.\n\nFinally, let's find the multiplicity of the pole. The multiplicity of a pole is the number of times it appears as a root of the denominator. In this case, the pole z = -1 appears with an exponent of 3 in the denominator, so its multiplicity is 3.\n\nIn summary, the function f(z) = (z - 2)^4 / (z + 1)^3 has a pole of order 3 and multiplicity 3 at the location z = -1."
