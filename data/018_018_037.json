    "message_2": "The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted as A Δ B, is the set of elements that are in either A or B, but not in both. In other words, it is the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nLet's find the symmetric difference of A and B:\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4}\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (union of A and B)\nA ∩ B = {3, 4} (intersection of A and B)\n\nNow, we subtract the intersection from the union:\n\nA Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - {3, 4} = {1, 2, 5, 6}\n\nSo, the symmetric difference of A and B is {1, 2, 5, 6}.\n\nNow, let's prove that the symmetric difference is commutative. We need to show that A Δ B = B Δ A.\n\nB Δ A = (B ∪ A) - (B ∩ A)\n\nSince the union and intersection of sets are commutative (A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A), we can rewrite this as:\n\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nComparing this with the expression for A Δ B, we can see that they are the same:\n\nA Δ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\nB Δ A = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\n\nTherefore, the symmetric difference is commutative:\n\nA Δ B = B Δ A"
