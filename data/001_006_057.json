    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation y = 2x^2 - 10x + 8, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x.\n\n0 = 2x^2 - 10x + 8\n\nNow, we can try to factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first:\n\n0 = 2(x^2 - 5x + 4)\n\nNow, we can factor the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n0 = 2(x - 4)(x - 1)\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx - 4 = 0 or x - 1 = 0\n\nx = 4 or x = 1\n\nSo, the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation are x = 1 and x = 4."
