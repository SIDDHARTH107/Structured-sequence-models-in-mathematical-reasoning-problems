    "message_1": "A student bets $5 dollars on a roulette wheel. The wheel is numbered from 1 to 36 (18 red and 18 black) with two green spaces numbered 0 and 00. What is the probability of winning if he bets on the number 24?",
    "message_2": "There are a total of 38 possible outcomes on the roulette wheel (36 numbers plus 0 and 00). The student is betting on a single number (24), so there is only 1 favorable outcome. Therefore, the probability of winning is:\n\n1 favorable outcome / 38 possible outcomes = 1/38 â‰ˆ 0.0263 or 2.63% chance of winning."
