    "message_2": "To find the sum P + Q, we will use the group law on elliptic curves. Since P and Q are distinct points, we can use the following formulas to find the slope λ and the coordinates (x3, y3) of the point P + Q:\n\nλ = (y2 - y1) * (x2 - x1)^(-1) mod p\nx3 = (λ^2 - x1 - x2) mod p\ny3 = (λ * (x1 - x3) - y1) mod p\n\nwhere p is the characteristic of the finite field, in this case, p = 23.\n\nFirst, we compute the slope λ:\n\nλ = (6 - 3) * (19 - 2)^(-1) mod 23\nλ = 3 * 17^(-1) mod 23\n\nTo find the inverse of 17 modulo 23, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or try different numbers until we find the correct one. In this case, the inverse of 17 modulo 23 is 3:\n\n17 * 3 ≡ 1 mod 23\n\nNow we can compute λ:\n\nλ = 3 * 3 mod 23\nλ = 9\n\nNext, we compute the coordinates x3 and y3:\n\nx3 = (9^2 - 2 - 19) mod 23\nx3 = (81 - 21) mod 23\nx3 = 60 mod 23\nx3 = 14\n\ny3 = (9 * (2 - 14) - 3) mod 23\ny3 = (-108 - 3) mod 23\ny3 = -111 mod 23\ny3 = 8\n\nSo, the sum P + Q = (14, 8)."
