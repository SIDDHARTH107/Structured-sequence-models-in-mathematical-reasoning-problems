    "message_1": "Suppose there are two firms in a Cournot competition, with the following demand function: P = 100 - Q, where P is the market price and Q is the total quantity produced by both firms. Each firm has a constant marginal cost of $20. What is the optimal quantity that each firm should produce in order to maximize their profits?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal quantity that each firm should produce to maximize their profits, we need to first find the reaction functions for both firms. Let q1 and q2 be the quantities produced by firm 1 and firm 2, respectively. Then, the total quantity produced in the market, Q, is given by Q = q1 + q2.\n\nThe revenue for firm 1 is given by R1 = P * q1 = (100 - Q) * q1 = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q1. Since the marginal cost is constant at $20, the total cost for firm 1 is C1 = 20 * q1. The profit for firm 1 is then given by π1 = R1 - C1 = (100 - (q1 + q2)) * q1 - 20 * q1.\n\nTo maximize firm 1's profit, we need to take the first-order derivative of π1 with respect to q1 and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(π1)/dq1 = (100 - q1 - q2 - 20) - q1 = 0\n\nSolving for q1, we get the reaction function for firm 1:\n\nq1 = (80 - q2)/2\n\nSimilarly, we can find the reaction function for firm 2:\n\nq2 = (80 - q1)/2\n\nNow, we need to find the Nash equilibrium by solving these two reaction functions simultaneously:\n\nq1 = (80 - (80 - q1)/2)/2\n\nSolving for q1, we get:\n\nq1 = 40/3 ≈ 13.33\n\nSubstituting q1 back into the reaction function for firm 2:\n\nq2 = (80 - 40/3)/2\n\nq2 = 40/3 ≈ 13.33\n\nSo, the optimal quantity that each firm should produce in order to maximize their profits is approximately 13.33 units."
