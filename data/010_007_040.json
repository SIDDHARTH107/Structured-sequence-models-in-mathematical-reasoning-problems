    "message_2": "To calculate the fundamental group of this figure eight curve, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The theorem states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected sets A and B, such that their intersection A ∩ B is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X, denoted π₁(X), can be calculated as follows:\n\nπ₁(X) ≅ π₁(A) * π₁(B) / N\n\nwhere * denotes the free product of groups, and N is the normal subgroup generated by elements of the form aba⁻¹b⁻¹ for a in π₁(A), b in π₁(B), and a⁻¹ and b⁻¹ are the inverses of a and b, respectively.\n\nNow, let's apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem to the figure eight curve. We can decompose the figure eight curve into two open, path-connected sets A and B, where A and B are each a circle with a small neighborhood around the basepoint. Their intersection A ∩ B is a small neighborhood around the basepoint, which is path-connected.\n\nThe fundamental group of a circle is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., π₁(A) ≅ π₁(B) ≅ ℤ. Let's denote the generator of each group as a for π₁(A) and b for π₁(B).\n\nThe intersection A ∩ B is contractible, which means its fundamental group is trivial, i.e., π₁(A ∩ B) ≅ {1}. Therefore, the only relation we need to consider in the normal subgroup N is aba⁻¹b⁻¹.\n\nNow, we can calculate the fundamental group of the figure eight curve:\n\nπ₁(X) ≅ π₁(A) * π₁(B) / N\nπ₁(X) ≅ ℤ * ℤ / ⟨aba⁻¹b⁻¹⟩\n\nHere, ⟨aba⁻¹b⁻¹⟩ denotes the normal subgroup generated by the element aba⁻¹b⁻¹. The resulting group is the free group on two generators, which can be denoted as F₂ or ℤ * ℤ.\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the figure eight curve is the free group on two generators:\n\nπ₁(X) ≅ F₂ ≅ ℤ * ℤ"
