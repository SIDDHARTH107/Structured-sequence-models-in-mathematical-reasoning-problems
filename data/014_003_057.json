    "message_2": "To compute the ciphertext (c1, c2) using ElGamal encryption, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute c1 = g^k mod p\n2. Compute c2 = (m * y^k) mod p\n\nGiven the public key (p=11, g=2, y=8), the message m=7, and the random number k=3, we can calculate c1 and c2 as follows:\n\n1. c1 = 2^3 mod 11 = 8 mod 11 = 8\n2. c2 = (7 * 8^3) mod 11 = (7 * 512) mod 11 = 3584 mod 11 = 10\n\nSo, the ciphertext (c1, c2) that Bob will send to Alice is (8, 10)."
