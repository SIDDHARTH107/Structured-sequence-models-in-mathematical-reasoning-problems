    "message_1": "Suppose you have a portfolio of two stocks - stock A and stock B. Stock A has an annual expected return of 10% and a standard deviation of 15%, while stock B has an annual expected return of 20% and a standard deviation of 25%. If you want to invest $50,000 in this portfolio, what would be the optimal investment allocation between stock A and stock B that maximizes the expected return while minimizing the risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio? Use the Markowitz portfolio optimization model to solve this problem.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem using the Markowitz portfolio optimization model, we need to find the optimal weights for stock A and stock B that maximize the expected return while minimizing the risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio. Let's denote the weight of stock A as w_A and the weight of stock B as w_B. Since we are investing the entire $50,000, we have:\n\nw_A + w_B = 1\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (E[R_p]) is given by:\n\nE[R_p] = w_A * E[R_A] + w_B * E[R_B]\n\nwhere E[R_A] and E[R_B] are the expected returns of stock A and stock B, respectively. In this case, E[R_A] = 10% and E[R_B] = 20%.\n\nThe variance of the portfolio (Var[R_p]) is given by:\n\nVar[R_p] = w_A^2 * σ_A^2 + w_B^2 * σ_B^2 + 2 * w_A * w_B * Cov[R_A, R_B]\n\nwhere σ_A and σ_B are the standard deviations of stock A and stock B, respectively, and Cov[R_A, R_B] is the covariance between the returns of stock A and stock B. In this case, σ_A = 15% and σ_B = 25%. We also need the correlation coefficient (ρ) between stock A and stock B to calculate the covariance:\n\nCov[R_A, R_B] = ρ * σ_A * σ_B\n\nHowever, we don't have the correlation coefficient in the problem statement. Assuming the correlation coefficient is given, we can proceed with the optimization.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the expected return while minimizing the risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio. We can use the Sharpe ratio as a measure of risk-adjusted return:\n\nSharpe ratio = (E[R_p] - R_f) / σ_p\n\nwhere R_f is the risk-free rate and σ_p is the standard deviation of the portfolio. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo find the optimal weights, we can set up a constrained optimization problem:\n\nMaximize: Sharpe ratio\nSubject to: w_A + w_B = 1\n\nUsing a numerical optimization technique (e.g., gradient descent or a solver in Excel), we can find the optimal weights w_A and w_B that maximize the Sharpe ratio. Once we have the optimal weights, we can calculate the optimal investment allocation between stock A and stock B:\n\nInvestment in stock A = $50,000 * w_A\nInvestment in stock B = $50,000 * w_B"
