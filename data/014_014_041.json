    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"MATH\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"SECRET\", we first need to create the 5x5 Playfair grid using the key.\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the key: \"SECR\" (T is already in the key)\n2. Fill the grid with the key and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher):\n\n   S  E  C  R  T\n   A  B  D  F  G\n   H  I  K  L  M\n   N  O  P  Q  U\n   V  W  X  Y  Z\n\n3. Break the message into pairs of letters: \"MA TH\"\n4. Encrypt each pair using the grid:\n\n   - For \"MA\": M is in row 3, column 5, and A is in row 2, column 1. So, we take the letters in the same row but at the other letter's column: row 3, column 1 (H) and row 2, column 5 (G). The encrypted pair is \"HG\".\n   - For \"TH\": T is in row 1, column 5, and H is in row 3, column 1. So, we take the letters in the same row but at the other letter's column: row 1, column 1 (S) and row 3, column 5 (M). The encrypted pair is \"SM\".\n\n5. Combine the encrypted pairs: \"HGSM\"\n\nThe encrypted message is \"HGSM\"."
