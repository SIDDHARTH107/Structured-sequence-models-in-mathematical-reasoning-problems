    "message_2": "To find the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1, we first need to find the first derivative, f'(x), and then find the derivative of f'(x), which will be the second derivative, f''(x).\n\nFirst derivative:\nf'(x) = d/dx(3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1)\nf'(x) = 12x^3 - 4x + 5\n\nNow, we find the second derivative:\nf''(x) = d/dx(12x^3 - 4x + 5)\nf''(x) = 36x^2 - 4\n\nNow, we need to find the value of the second derivative at x = 2:\nf''(2) = 36(2)^2 - 4\nf''(2) = 36(4) - 4\nf''(2) = 144 - 4\nf''(2) = 140\n\nSo, the second derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1 at x = 2 is 140."
