    "message_1": "A factory produces packets of cookies, and the weight of each packet follows a normal distribution with a mean of 500 grams and a standard deviation of 20 grams. A random sample of 25 packets is selected. What is the probability that the average weight of the packets in the sample is less than 490 grams?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nGiven that the mean weight of the packets is 500 grams and the standard deviation is 20 grams, we can find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean.\n\nMean of the sampling distribution (μ_sample) = μ_population = 500 grams\n\nStandard deviation of the sampling distribution (σ_sample) = σ_population / √n = 20 grams / √25 = 20 grams / 5 = 4 grams\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the average weight of the packets in the sample is less than 490 grams. To do this, we will convert the value of 490 grams to a z-score using the formula:\n\nz = (x - μ_sample) / σ_sample\n\nz = (490 - 500) / 4 = -10 / 4 = -2.5\n\nNow, we will use the standard normal distribution table (also known as the z-table) to find the probability corresponding to the z-score of -2.5.\n\nLooking up the z-score of -2.5 in the z-table, we find the probability to be 0.0062.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the average weight of the packets in the sample is less than 490 grams is approximately 0.0062 or 0.62%."
