    "message_1": "In a Trust Game, Player 1 is given $10 and can decide how much to send to Player 2. Whatever amount Player 1 sends, it is tripled and Player 2 decides how much to send back to Player 1. If Player 2 sends back $12, how much did Player 1 originally send?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the amount Player 1 originally sent to Player 2. When the amount is tripled, it becomes 3x. Player 2 then sends back $12 to Player 1. We can set up the equation:\n\n3x - 12 = x\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n3x - x = 12\n2x = 12\nx = 6\n\nSo, Player 1 originally sent $6 to Player 2."
