    "message_2": "To determine the second and third Chern classes of T_X, we first need to recall the definition of Chern classes and their properties.\n\nThe Chern classes are characteristic classes associated with complex vector bundles. For a complex vector bundle E of rank r, the total Chern class is defined as:\n\nc(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E) + ... + c_r(E),\n\nwhere c_i(E) are the individual Chern classes. The Chern classes have the following properties:\n\n1. c(EâŠ•F) = c(E) * c(F), where E and F are complex vector bundles.\n2. For a line bundle L, c_1(L) is the first Chern class, and all higher Chern classes are zero.\n\nNow, let's consider the tangent bundle T_X of the complex manifold X. Since X has complex dimension 2, T_X is a rank-2 complex vector bundle. We are given that the total Chern class of T_X is:\n\nc(T_X) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2,\n\nwhere x is the first Chern class of T_X.\n\nComparing this expression with the general definition of the total Chern class, we can identify the individual Chern classes:\n\nc_1(T_X) = 2x,\nc_2(T_X) = 3x^2.\n\nThus, the second Chern class of T_X is 3x^2, and there is no third Chern class since the rank of T_X is 2."
