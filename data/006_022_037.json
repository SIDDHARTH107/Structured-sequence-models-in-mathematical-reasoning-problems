    "message_1": "In a particular school, 60% of students go on to attend college after graduation. A random sample of 100 students from this school is selected. What is the probability that exactly 50 students from the sample intend to attend college after graduation?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (n choose x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)\n\nwhere:\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, the number of students in the sample, which is 100)\n- x is the number of successful trials (in this case, the number of students who intend to attend college, which is 50)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of a student attending college, which is 0.6)\n- (n choose x) is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, calculated as n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(50) = (100 choose 50) * 0.6^50 * (1-0.6)^(100-50)\n\nFirst, let's calculate (100 choose 50):\n\n(100 choose 50) = 100! / (50! * (100-50)!)\n= 100! / (50! * 50!)\n\nNow, let's calculate 0.6^50 and (1-0.6)^(100-50):\n\n0.6^50 ≈ 1.42 * 10^(-7)\n(1-0.6)^(100-50) = 0.4^50 ≈ 9.09 * 10^(-16)\n\nNow, let's multiply all the values together:\n\nP(50) ≈ (100 choose 50) * 1.42 * 10^(-7) * 9.09 * 10^(-16)\n\nTo calculate (100 choose 50), we can use a calculator or an online tool. The result is approximately:\n\n(100 choose 50) ≈ 1.01 * 10^(29)\n\nNow, let's multiply all the values together:\n\nP(50) ≈ 1.01 * 10^(29) * 1.42 * 10^(-7) * 9.09 * 10^(-16)\nP(50) ≈ 1.29 * 10^(6)\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 50 students from the sample intend to attend college after graduation is approximately 1.29 * 10^(6), or 0.000129, or 0.0129%."
