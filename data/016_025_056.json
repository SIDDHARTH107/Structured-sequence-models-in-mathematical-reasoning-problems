    "message_2": "The Sierpinski sieve is a fractal pattern that is formed by repeatedly removing smaller equilateral triangles from a larger equilateral triangle. In each iteration, the remaining triangles are divided into four smaller equilateral triangles, and the middle triangle is removed.\n\nThe total number of shaded cells (triangles) after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal shaded cells = (4^n - 1) / 3\n\nIn this case, we are asked to find the total number of shaded cells after the 6th iteration:\n\nTotal shaded cells = (4^6 - 1) / 3\nTotal shaded cells = (4096 - 1) / 3\nTotal shaded cells = 4095 / 3\nTotal shaded cells = 1365\n\nSo, after the 6th iteration of constructing the Sierpinski sieve, there will be 1365 shaded cells (triangles)."
