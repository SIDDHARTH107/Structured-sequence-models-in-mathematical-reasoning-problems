    "message_1": "An abductive logic problem for a math student to solve is:\n\nGiven that a statement is true for the numbers 1, 2, and 3. What is the minimum number of additional true values are needed to obtain a proof of the statement for all positive integers?",
    "message_2": "To prove a statement for all positive integers, we need to use mathematical induction. In this method, we first prove the statement for the base case (which is already given as true for 1, 2, and 3). Then, we need to prove that if the statement is true for an arbitrary positive integer k, it is also true for k+1.\n\nSince we already have the base cases, we only need to prove the inductive step. Therefore, the minimum number of additional true values needed to obtain a proof of the statement for all positive integers is 0, as long as we can prove the inductive step."
