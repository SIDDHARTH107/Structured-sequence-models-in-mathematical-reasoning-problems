    "message_2": "To decrypt the message using the Vigenere cipher, we need to reverse the encryption process. The Vigenere cipher uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A table of alphabets can be used, termed a tabula recta, Vigenère square, or Vigenère table. It consists of the alphabet written out 26 times in different rows, each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar ciphers. At different points in the encryption process, the cipher uses a different alphabet from one of the rows. The alphabet used at each point depends on a repeating keyword.\n\nHere's the decryption process:\n\n1. Write down the ciphertext: OKGSS\n2. Write down the key below the ciphertext, repeating it as necessary: MATHM\n3. For each letter in the ciphertext, find the corresponding row in the Vigenere table (using the key letter) and locate the column containing the ciphertext letter. The letter at the top of that column is the decrypted letter.\n\nLet's decrypt the message:\n\nO (with key M): O is in the M row at column H, so the decrypted letter is H.\nK (with key A): K is in the A row at column E, so the decrypted letter is E.\nG (with key T): G is in the T row at column L, so the decrypted letter is L.\nS (with key H): S is in the H row at column L, so the decrypted letter is L.\nS (with key M): S is in the M row at column O, so the decrypted letter is O.\n\nThe decrypted message is \"HELLO\"."
