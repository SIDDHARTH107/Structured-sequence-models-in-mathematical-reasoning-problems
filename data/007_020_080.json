    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem on RSA encryption for the math student to solve:\n\nSuppose Alice wants to send a confidential message to Bob using RSA encryption. Bob's public key is (N = 323, e = 5), where N is the product of two prime numbers p and q, and e is a co-prime integer less than (p-1) * (q-1). The message she wants to send is 123. Use the RSA encryption algorithm to calculate the ciphertext that Alice should send.",
    "message_2": "To calculate the ciphertext that Alice should send using the RSA encryption algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factors of N.\n2. Calculate the value of the totient function, φ(N).\n3. Use the public key (N, e) to encrypt the message.\n\nStep 1: Find the prime factors of N.\nN = 323\nThe prime factors of 323 are 17 and 19 (since 17 * 19 = 323).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the value of the totient function, φ(N).\nφ(N) = (p-1) * (q-1)\nφ(323) = (17-1) * (19-1) = 16 * 18 = 288\n\nStep 3: Use the public key (N, e) to encrypt the message.\nThe public key is (N = 323, e = 5). The message Alice wants to send is 123.\nCiphertext (C) = M^e mod N\nC = 123^5 mod 323\n\nCalculating 123^5 mod 323:\n123^5 = 28153056843\n28153056843 mod 323 = 81\n\nSo, the ciphertext that Alice should send is 81."
