    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 8 cm and the lengths of its parallel sides are 12 cm and 18 cm. Find the perimeter of the trapezium.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the shorter parallel side a (12 cm) and the length of the longer parallel side b (18 cm). Let's call the height h (8 cm). Let's also call the lengths of the other two sides x and y.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of x and y. Since the trapezium is not necessarily an isosceles trapezium, we need to find the length of the base of each of the right triangles formed by the height and the non-parallel sides. Let's call the base of the right triangle with side x as c and the base of the right triangle with side y as d.\n\nWe know that c + d = b - a = 18 - 12 = 6 cm.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem for each right triangle:\n\nx^2 = h^2 + c^2\ny^2 = h^2 + d^2\n\nWe don't have enough information to find the exact values of c and d, so we cannot find the exact lengths of x and y. However, we can express the perimeter of the trapezium in terms of c and d:\n\nPerimeter = a + b + x + y\n= 12 + 18 + sqrt(h^2 + c^2) + sqrt(h^2 + d^2)\n= 30 + sqrt(8^2 + c^2) + sqrt(8^2 + (6 - c)^2)\n\nWithout more information, we cannot find the exact perimeter of the trapezium."
