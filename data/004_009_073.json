    "message_2": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular prism be x, y, and z, where x is the edge that is increasing at a rate of 2 cm/s. So, initially, x = 5 cm, y = 8 cm, and z = 10 cm. The volume V of the rectangular prism is given by:\n\nV = xyz\n\nWe are given that x is increasing at a rate of 2 cm/s, which can be written as dx/dt = 2 cm/s. We want to find the rate at which the volume is increasing, which is dV/dt, when each of its edges double in length. That means x = 10 cm, y = 16 cm, and z = 20 cm.\n\nTo find dV/dt, we can first differentiate the volume equation with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = (dV/dx)(dx/dt) + (dV/dy)(dy/dt) + (dV/dz)(dz/dt)\n\nSince y and z are not changing with respect to time, their rates of change dy/dt and dz/dt are both 0. So, the equation simplifies to:\n\ndV/dt = (dV/dx)(dx/dt)\n\nNow, differentiate V with respect to x:\n\ndV/dx = yz\n\nSubstitute the values of y and z when the edges are doubled:\n\ndV/dx = (16)(20) = 320\n\nNow, substitute the values of dV/dx and dx/dt into the equation for dV/dt:\n\ndV/dt = (320)(2) = 640 cm³/s\n\nSo, the rate at which the volume of the prism is increasing when each of its edges double in length is 640 cm³/s."
