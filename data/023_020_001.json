Since f(x) is an even function (symmetric about the y-axis), the Fourier series will only contain cosine terms, and all b_n coefficients will be zero.\n\nThe Fourier series for an even function is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_0/2 + Σ[a_n * cos(n * x)]\n\nwhere a_0 and a_n are the Fourier coefficients, and the sum is taken from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nTo find the coefficients, we use the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * 1]dx from -π to π\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[|x|]dx from -π to π\n\nSince |x| = x for x ≥ 0 and |x| = -x for x < 0, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-x]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x]dx from 0 to π]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(-x^2/2)|(-π to 0) + (x^2/2)|(0 to π)]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [(0 - (-π^2/2)) + (π^2/2 - 0)]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * π^2\n\na_0 = π\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[|x| * cos(n * x)]dx from -π to π\n\nAgain, we split the integral into two parts:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-x * cos(n * x)]dx from -π to 0 + ∫[x * cos(n * x)]dx from 0 to π]\n\nWe can use integration by parts to solve these integrals. Let u = x and dv = cos(n * x)dx, then du = dx and v = (1/n) * sin(n * x).\n\na_n = (1/π) * {[-(1/n) * x * sin(n * x) - (1/n^2) * ∫[sin(n * x)]dx] from -π to 0 + [(1/n) * x * sin(n * x) - (1/n^2) * ∫[sin(n * x)]dx from 0 to π]}\n\na_n = (1/π) * {[-(1/n) * x * sin(n * x) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * x)] from -π to 0 + [(1/n) * x * sin(n * x) - (1/n^2) * cos(n * x)] from 0 to π}\n\na_n = (1/π) * {[-(1/n) * π * sin(-n * π) + (1/n^2) * cos(n * π) - (1/n^2) * cos(0)] + [(1/n) * π * sin(n * π) - (1/n^2) * cos(n * π) + (1/n^2) * cos(0)]}\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * {[(1/n^2) * cos(n * π) - (1/n^2) * cos(0)] - [(1/n^2) * cos(n * π) + (1/n^2) * cos(0)]}\n\na_n = (1/π) * {2 * (1/n^2) * (cos(0) - cos(n * π))}\n\na_n = (2/n^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x) = |x|:\n\nf(x) = π/2 + Σ[((2/n^2) * (1 - (-1)^n)) * cos(n * x)] from n = 1 to infinity\n\nThis is the Fourier series representation of the function f(x) = |x| on the interval [-π, π]."
