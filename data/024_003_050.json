    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 at the point (1,1,2), we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms.\n\nLet's parametrize the surface as follows:\nS(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 + v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first derivatives with respect to u and v:\nSu = (∂S/∂u) = (1, 0, 2u)\nSv = (∂S/∂v) = (0, 1, 2v)\n\nThe first fundamental form coefficients are given by:\nE = <Su, Su> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <Su, Sv> = 4uv\nG = <Sv, Sv> = 1 + 4v^2\n\nNow, we compute the second derivatives with respect to u and v:\nSuu = (∂²S/∂u²) = (0, 0, 2)\nSuv = (∂²S/∂u∂v) = (0, 0, 0)\nSvv = (∂²S/∂v²) = (0, 0, 2)\n\nThe second fundamental form coefficients are given by:\nL = <-Su, Suu> = -2\nM = <-Su, Suv> = 0\nN = <-Su, Svv> = -2\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,2), we have u = 1 and v = 1, so we can plug in these values to find the coefficients:\nE = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nF = 4(1)(1) = 4\nG = 1 + 4(1)^2 = 5\nL = -2\nM = 0\nN = -2\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K:\nK = (-2 * -2 - 0^2) / (5 * 5 - 4^2) = (4) / (25 - 16) = 4 / 9\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature at the point (1,1,2) on the surface z = x^2 + y^2 is K = 4/9."
