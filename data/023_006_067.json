    "message_2": "The given function f(x) is already expressed as a sum of sinusoids (sines and cosines). Therefore, we can directly identify the frequency components of the signal without computing the Fourier Transform.\n\nf(x) = 5cos(4πx) + 2sin(8πx) + 3cos(12πx)\n\nThe frequency components are given by the coefficients of the sine and cosine functions:\n\n1. Amplitude: 5, Frequency: (4π)/(2π) = 2 Hz, Component: 5cos(4πx)\n2. Amplitude: 2, Frequency: (8π)/(2π) = 4 Hz, Component: 2sin(8πx)\n3. Amplitude: 3, Frequency: (12π)/(2π) = 6 Hz, Component: 3cos(12πx)\n\nSo, the frequency components of the signal are:\n\n1. A cosine wave with amplitude 5 and frequency 2 Hz\n2. A sine wave with amplitude 2 and frequency 4 Hz\n3. A cosine wave with amplitude 3 and frequency 6 Hz"
