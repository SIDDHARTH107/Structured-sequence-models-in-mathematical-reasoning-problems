    "message_1": "A metal plate with sides of length 1 meter is initially at 0 degrees Celsius. At time t=0, the temperature along the boundary of the plate is kept at 50 degrees Celsius. Using Fourier series, determine the temperature distribution inside the plate at any time t. Assume that the thermal conductivity of the metal plate is constant throughout and equal to 1.5 units.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the two-dimensional heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂u/∂t = k(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)\n\nwhere u(x, y, t) is the temperature at point (x, y) and time t, and k is the thermal conductivity of the material.\n\nWe are given the boundary conditions:\n\nu(0, y, t) = u(1, y, t) = u(x, 0, t) = u(x, 1, t) = 50\n\nand the initial condition:\n\nu(x, y, 0) = 0\n\nWe will use the method of separation of variables to solve this problem. Let u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y(y)T(t). Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\nX(x)Y(y)dT(t)/dt = k(X''(x)Y(y)T(t) + X(x)Y''(y)T(t))\n\nDividing both sides by kXYT, we get:\n\n(1/kT)dT/dt = X''/X + Y''/Y\n\nSince the left side depends only on t and the right side depends only on x and y, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ². So we have two equations:\n\n(1/kT)dT/dt = -λ²\nX''/X + Y''/Y = -λ²\n\nNow, we have two separate equations:\n\nX'' + λ²X = 0\nY'' + λ²Y = 0\n\nThese are ordinary differential equations with solutions:\n\nX(x) = A*cos(λx) + B*sin(λx)\nY(y) = C*cos(λy) + D*sin(λy)\n\nApplying the boundary conditions for x and y:\n\nX(0) = A = 50\nX(1) = 50*cos(λ) + 50*sin(λ) = 50\nY(0) = C = 50\nY(1) = 50*cos(λ) + 50*sin(λ) = 50\n\nFrom these conditions, we can see that λ = nπ for integer n, and B = D = 0. So the solutions for X(x) and Y(y) are:\n\nX(x) = 50*cos(nπx)\nY(y) = 50*cos(nπy)\n\nNow, we need to find the solution for T(t). The equation is:\n\n(1/kT)dT/dt = -n²π²\n\nSeparating variables and integrating, we get:\n\n∫(dT/T) = -n²π²∫(dt/k)\n\nln(T) = -n²π²t/k + C₁\nT(t) = C₂*exp(-n²π²t/k)\n\nNow, we can write the solution for u(x, y, t) as a product of X(x), Y(y), and T(t):\n\nu(x, y, t) = Σ[50²*cos(nπx)cos(nπy)exp(-n²π²t/k)]\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all integer values of n. This is the temperature distribution inside the metal plate at any time t."
