    "message_1": "A grocery store has 20 aisles and wants to create a weekly promotion where customers can win a prize by finding a hidden block in the store. The promotion will run for 10 weeks and each week a random block will be chosen as the hidden block. How many unique sets of hidden blocks can be chosen for each week's promotion such that no block is chosen more than once throughout the 10 weeks?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of unique sets of hidden blocks that can be chosen for each week's promotion without choosing any block more than once, we can use the concept of combinations. In this case, we are choosing 10 blocks (weeks) out of 20 aisles without repetition.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items (aisles), k is the number of items to be chosen (weeks), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 20 and k = 10, so we have:\n\nC(20, 10) = 20! / (10!(20-10)!)\n\nC(20, 10) = 20! / (10!10!)\n\nCalculating the factorials and dividing, we get:\n\nC(20, 10) = 2,432,902\n\nSo there are 2,432,902 unique sets of hidden blocks that can be chosen for each week's promotion without choosing any block more than once throughout the 10 weeks."
