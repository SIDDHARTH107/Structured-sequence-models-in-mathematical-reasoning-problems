If there are infinitely many solutions, express them in terms of the parameters.",
    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using matrix algebra, we first write the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  3 ]\n[ 2  4 -2 |  6 ]\n[ 3  6 -3 |  9 ]\n```\n\nNow, we perform Gaussian elimination to row reduce the matrix to its row echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n[ 1  2 -1 |  3 ]\n[ 0  0  0 |  0 ]\n[ 0  0  0 |  0 ]\n```\n\nThe row reduced matrix has a row of zeros, which indicates that the system is either inconsistent or has infinitely many solutions. Since the last column of the row of zeros is also zero (0 = 0), the system is consistent and has infinitely many solutions.\n\nNow, we express the solutions in terms of parameters:\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\n\nx + 2y - z = 3\n\nLet's express y and z in terms of a parameter t:\n\ny = t\n\nz = 2t\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the equation for x:\n\nx + 2(t) - (2t) = 3\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, the general solution to the system is:\n\nx = 3\ny = t\nz = 2t\n\nwhere t is a parameter that can take any real number value."
