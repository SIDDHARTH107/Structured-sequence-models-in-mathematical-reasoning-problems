    "message_2": "To find the value of x₅₀, we need to iterate the given function 50 times, starting with x₀ = 0.2. We can do this using a loop:\n\nx = 0.2\nfor i in range(50):\n    x = 4 * x * (1 - x)\n\nThe value of x after 50 iterations will be x₅₀. Let's calculate it:\n\nx = 0.2\nfor i in range(50):\n    x = 4 * x * (1 - x)\n\nx_50 = round(x, 4)\nx_50"
