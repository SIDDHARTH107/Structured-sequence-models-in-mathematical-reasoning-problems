    "message_1": "A soft drink company claims that their cans contain an average of 400 ml with a standard deviation of 20 ml. A random sample of 50 cans is chosen. What is the probability that the sample mean volume is less than 395 ml?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE) of the sample mean. The standard error is the standard deviation of the sample mean and is calculated as follows:\n\nSE = σ / √n\n\nwhere σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, σ = 20 ml and n = 50.\n\nSE = 20 / √50 ≈ 2.83 ml\n\nNow, we need to find the z-score for the sample mean of 395 ml. The z-score is the number of standard errors a value is away from the population mean (μ). It is calculated as follows:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / SE\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean and μ is the population mean.\n\nIn this case, x̄ = 395 ml and μ = 400 ml.\n\nz = (395 - 400) / 2.83 ≈ -1.77\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the sample mean is less than 395 ml, which is the same as finding the probability that the z-score is less than -1.77. We can use a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function to find this probability.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score being less than -1.77 is approximately 0.0385 or 3.85%.\n\nSo, there is a 3.85% chance that the sample mean volume is less than 395 ml."
