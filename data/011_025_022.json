    "message_1": "In a Combinatorial game, two players start with a pile of 25 coins. They take turns removing 1, 2 or 3 coins from the pile until there are no coins left. The player who takes the last coin is declared the winner. If the first player goes first, how many different ways are there to play the game so that the second player wins?",
    "message_2": "Let's use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let dp[i] be the number of ways to play the game with i coins left in the pile such that the second player wins. We want to find dp[25].\n\nBase cases:\n- dp[0] = 0, as there are no coins left, and no one can win.\n- dp[1] = 0, as the first player can take the last coin and win.\n- dp[2] = 1, as the first player can take 1 coin, leaving 1 coin for the second player to win.\n- dp[3] = 1, as the first player can take 2 coins, leaving 1 coin for the second player to win.\n\nNow, we can use the following recurrence relation to fill the rest of the dp array:\n\ndp[i] = dp[i-2] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-4] - dp[i-5] - dp[i-6] - dp[i-7]\n\nThe reasoning behind this recurrence relation is as follows:\n- If the first player takes 1 coin, there are dp[i-2] ways for the second player to win.\n- If the first player takes 2 coins, there are dp[i-3] ways for the second player to win.\n- If the first player takes 3 coins, there are dp[i-4] ways for the second player to win.\n- We subtract dp[i-5], dp[i-6], and dp[i-7] to avoid counting the cases where the first player loses.\n\nNow, we can fill the dp array using this recurrence relation:\n\nfor i in range(4, 26):\n    dp[i] = dp[i-2] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-4] - dp[i-5] - dp[i-6] - dp[i-7]\n\nFinally, the answer we want is dp[25]."
