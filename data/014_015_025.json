    "message_2": "A rail fence cipher arranges the plaintext message in a zigzag pattern along the rails and then reads the ciphertext off in rows. For the given plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" and 4 rails, the arrangement would look like this:\n\nM---A---S\n-T--E-A-I\n--H-M-T-C\n---T---I\n\nNow, reading the ciphertext off in rows, we get the following:\n\nMAS TEAI HMTCT TI\n\nSo, the ciphertext message is \"MASTEAIHMTCTTI\"."
