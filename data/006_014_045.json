    "message_1": "A certain type of technological system is known to have a 7% chance of failure during any given year. If a company has 5 such systems installed, what is the probability that at least one of those systems will fail within the next year?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can first find the probability that none of the systems fail within the next year and then subtract that probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one system fails.\n\nThe probability that a single system does not fail within the next year is 1 - 0.07 = 0.93.\n\nSince the systems are independent, the probability that all 5 systems do not fail within the next year is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\n0.93 * 0.93 * 0.93 * 0.93 * 0.93 = 0.93^5 ≈ 0.69834\n\nNow, we subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that at least one system fails within the next year:\n\n1 - 0.69834 ≈ 0.30166\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the 5 systems will fail within the next year is approximately 30.166%."
