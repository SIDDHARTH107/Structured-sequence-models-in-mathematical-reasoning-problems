    "message_1": "A cylindrical tank has a height of 6 meters and a radius of 2 meters. What is the total surface area of the tank in square meters?",
    "message_2": "To find the total surface area of the cylindrical tank, we need to find the surface area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nThe surface area of one circular base is given by the formula A = πr², where r is the radius. Since there are two bases, we multiply the area of one base by 2:\n\nA_bases = 2 * π * (2 m)² = 2 * π * 4 m² = 8π m²\n\nNow, we need to find the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula A = 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height:\n\nA_lateral = 2 * π * (2 m) * (6 m) = 24π m²\n\nFinally, we add the surface area of the bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\n\nA_total = A_bases + A_lateral = 8π m² + 24π m² = 32π m² ≈ 100.53 m²\n\nThe total surface area of the tank is approximately 100.53 square meters."
