    "message_1": "A candy company sells two types of candy bars, A and B. Each candy bar A costs $1.50 to produce and sells for $2.25, while each candy bar B costs $2.00 to produce and sells for $3.00. The company can produce at most 1600 candy bars per day due to production constraints. The company must produce at least 400 candy bars of type A per day to meet demand, but no more than 1200 candy bars of type A can be produced. Similarly, the company must produce at least 200 candy bars of type B per day to meet demand, but no more than 800 candy bars of type B can be produced. How many candy bars of each type should the company produce per day to maximize profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of candy bars of type A produced per day, and y be the number of candy bars of type B produced per day. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 0.75x + 1.00y, subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 1600 (production constraint)\n2. 400 ≤ x ≤ 1200 (demand constraint for type A)\n3. 200 ≤ y ≤ 800 (demand constraint for type B)\n\nFirst, we will find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. x + y = 1600 is the line with slope -1 and y-intercept 1600. The inequality x + y ≤ 1600 represents the region below this line.\n2. x = 400 and x = 1200 are vertical lines, and the inequality 400 ≤ x ≤ 1200 represents the region between these lines.\n3. y = 200 and y = 800 are horizontal lines, and the inequality 200 ≤ y ≤ 800 represents the region between these lines.\n\nThe feasible region is a rectangle with vertices at (400, 200), (400, 800), (1200, 200), and (1200, 800). To maximize the profit function, we will evaluate P(x, y) at each of these vertices:\n\n1. P(400, 200) = 0.75(400) + 1.00(200) = 300 + 200 = 500\n2. P(400, 800) = 0.75(400) + 1.00(800) = 300 + 800 = 1100\n3. P(1200, 200) = 0.75(1200) + 1.00(200) = 900 + 200 = 1100\n4. P(1200, 800) = 0.75(1200) + 1.00(800) = 900 + 800 = 1700\n\nThe maximum profit occurs when the company produces 1200 candy bars of type A and 800 candy bars of type B per day, resulting in a profit of $1700 per day."
