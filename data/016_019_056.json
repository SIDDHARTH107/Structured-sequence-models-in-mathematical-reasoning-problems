    "message_2": "The Koch island is formed by applying the Koch curve to each side of an equilateral triangle. The length of the Koch curve after the nth iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (initial length) * (4^n) / (3^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 3 cm, and we want to find the length after the 5th iteration (n = 5).\n\nLength = (3) * (4^5) / (3^5)\n\nLength = (3) * (1024) / (243)\n\nLength = 3072 / 243\n\nLength ≈ 12.64 cm\n\nSince the Koch island has three sides, the total length of the Koch island after the 5th iteration is:\n\nTotal Length = 3 * Length\n\nTotal Length = 3 * 12.64\n\nTotal Length ≈ 37.92 cm"
