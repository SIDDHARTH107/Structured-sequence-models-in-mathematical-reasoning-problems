    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution, elimination, or matrix method. However, before we do that, let's analyze the given equations.\n\nEquation 1: 2x + 3y = 5\nEquation 2: 4x + 6y = 10\n\nNotice that the second equation is just a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n2(2x + 3y) = 2(5)\n4x + 6y = 10\n\nThis is the same as the second equation. Since both equations are essentially the same, they represent the same line in the xy-plane. Therefore, the system has infinitely many solutions, as every point on the line is a solution to both equations."
