    "message_2": "Since f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2 is an analytic function (i.e., it has continuous derivatives of all orders), we can apply Cauchy's integral theorem, which states that the integral of an analytic function over a closed curve is zero. Therefore, the integral of f(z) dz along the curve |z-1| = 1 is:\n\nâˆ®f(z) dz = 0"
