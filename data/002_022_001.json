    "message_1": "A torus has a major radius of 4 cm and a minor radius of 2 cm. What is the volume of this torus?",
    "message_2": "The volume V of a torus can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * R * r^2\n\nwhere R is the major radius and r is the minor radius.\n\nIn this case, R = 4 cm and r = 2 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = 2 * π^2 * 4 * (2^2)\nV = 2 * π^2 * 4 * 4\nV = 32 * π^2\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π^2 as 9.8696:\n\nV ≈ 32 * 9.8696\nV ≈ 315.8272 cm^3\n\nSo, the volume of the torus is approximately 315.83 cubic centimeters."
