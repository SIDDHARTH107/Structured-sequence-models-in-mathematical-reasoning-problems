    "message_2": "To find the total number of different 4x4 Latin squares possible, we can use the following method:\n\n1. The first row can be filled in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.\n2. The second row can be filled in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways. This is because there are 3 choices for the first cell, 2 choices for the second cell, and only 1 choice for the third cell (the fourth cell is determined by the other three).\n3. The third row can be filled in 2! (2 factorial) ways, which is 2 × 1 = 2 ways. This is because there are 2 choices for the first cell and only 1 choice for the second cell (the third and fourth cells are determined by the other two).\n4. The fourth row is determined by the other three rows, so there is only 1 way to fill it.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of ways to fill each row together: 24 × 6 × 2 × 1 = 288.\n\nTherefore, there are 288 different 4x4 Latin squares possible."
