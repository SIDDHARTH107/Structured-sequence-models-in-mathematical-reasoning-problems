    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using sparse matrices, we first need to represent the given system as a matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the constant terms column vector.\n\nThe given system can be represented as:\n\n```\nA = | 3  2  4 |\n    | 2  2  1 |\n    | 4  0  2 |\n\nx = | x |\n    | y |\n    | z |\n\nb = | 13 |\n    |  8 |\n    |  2 |\n```\n\nNow, we will convert the matrix A into a sparse matrix representation. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. In this case, our matrix A is not sparse, but we can still represent it in a sparse matrix format for the sake of the exercise.\n\nA sparse matrix can be represented using a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row index, column index, and the value of the non-zero element.\n\nSparse matrix representation of A:\n\n```\nsparse_A = [\n    (0, 0, 3),\n    (0, 1, 2),\n    (0, 2, 4),\n    (1, 0, 2),\n    (1, 1, 2),\n    (1, 2, 1),\n    (2, 0, 4),\n    (2, 2, 2)\n]\n```\n\nNow, we will solve the matrix equation Ax = b using the sparse matrix representation of A. Since the given system of linear equations is small, we can use the Gaussian elimination method to solve it.\n\n1. First, we will eliminate the x term from the second and third equations:\n\nDivide the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the second equation:\n```\n(1/3) * (3x + 2y + 4z) - (2x + 2y + z) = (1/3) * 13 - 8\n```\n\nThis simplifies to:\n```\n(1/3) * 4z - z = (1/3) * 13 - 8\n```\n\nNow, divide the first equation by 3 and subtract it from the third equation:\n```\n(1/3) * (3x + 2y + 4z) - (4x + 2z) = (1/3) * 13 - 2\n```\n\nThis simplifies to:\n```\n(-x - 2y) = (1/3) * 13 - 2\n```\n\n2. Now, we have a new system of linear equations:\n\n```\n3x + 2y + 4z = 13\n(1/3) * 4z - z = (1/3) * 13 - 8\n-x - 2y = (1/3) * 13 - 2\n```\n\nSimplify the second and third equations:\n\n```\nz = 1\nx + 2y = 2\n```\n\n3. Substitute the value of z into the first equation and solve for x and y:\n\n```\n3x + 2y + 4(1) = 13\n3x + 2y = 9\n```\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n```\nx + 2y = 2\n3x + 2y = 9\n```\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n```\n(3x + 2y) - (x + 2y) = 9 - 2\n```\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n```\n2x = 7\nx = 7/2\n```\n\nNow, substitute the value of x into the first equation and solve for y:\n\n```\n(7/2) + 2y = 2\n2y = 2 - (7/2)\n2y = (4 - 7)/2\n2y = -3/2\ny = -3/4\n```\n\nSo, the solution to the given system of linear equations is:\n\n```\nx = 7/2\ny = -3/4\nz = 1\n```"
