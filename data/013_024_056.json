    "message_1": "In a volunteering program, there are five volunteers who are willing to contribute to the program while the organization can only accommodate three volunteers. Each volunteer incurs a cost of $50 to participate in the program, but they don't receive any monetary reward. If three volunteers are selected randomly, what is the probability that all of them are willing to pay the cost and participate in the program?",
    "message_2": "Since all five volunteers are willing to contribute to the program and pay the cost, the probability that all three randomly selected volunteers are willing to pay the cost and participate in the program is 1, or 100%. This is because there are no other types of volunteers in the given scenario, and all of them are willing to pay the cost."
