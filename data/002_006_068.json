    "message_2": "To find the circumference of a circle, we use the formula C = πd, where C is the circumference, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and d is the diameter.\n\nGiven the diameter is 10 centimeters, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nC = π(10)\nC ≈ 3.14159(10)\nC ≈ 31.4159\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, the circumference is approximately 31.42 centimeters."
