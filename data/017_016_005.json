    "message_2": "There are three non-isomorphic groups of order 27, which is a prime power (3^3). These groups can be classified using the Sylow theorems and the fact that all groups of prime power order are p-groups. The three non-isomorphic groups of order 27 are:\n\n1. The cyclic group of order 27, denoted as Z_27 or C_27. This group has a single generator, and its elements can be written as {0, 1, 2, ..., 26}, with addition modulo 27 as the group operation.\n\n2. The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3 and 9, denoted as Z_9 ⨁ Z_3 or C_9 × C_3. This group has two generators, one for each cyclic subgroup, and its elements can be written as ordered pairs (a, b), where a ∈ {0, 1, ..., 8} and b ∈ {0, 1, 2}. The group operation is component-wise addition modulo the respective orders of the cyclic subgroups.\n\n3. The Heisenberg group of order 27, which is a non-abelian group. It can be represented as a group of 3x3 upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal and elements from the field of order 3 (Z_3) in the upper triangle. The group operation is matrix multiplication. The Heisenberg group has the following presentation:\n\nH = { (1, a, b; 0, 1, c; 0, 0, 1) | a, b, c ∈ Z_3 }\n\nIn summary, there are three non-isomorphic groups of order 27: the cyclic group Z_27, the direct product of cyclic groups Z_9 ⨁ Z_3, and the Heisenberg group H."
