    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * sin(x), we will use the product rule. The product rule states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function.\n\nLet u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = sin(x). Then, the derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of u(x) and v(x):\n\nu'(x) = 2x\nv'(x) = cos(x)\n\nNow, we can plug these derivatives back into the product rule formula:\n\nf'(x) = (2x)(sin(x)) + (x^2)(cos(x))\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = pi/2:\n\nf'(pi/2) = (2(pi/2))(sin(pi/2)) + ((pi/2)^2)(cos(pi/2))\nf'(pi/2) = (pi)(1) + ((pi^2)/4)(0)\nf'(pi/2) = pi\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = x^2 * sin(x) at x = pi/2 is pi."
