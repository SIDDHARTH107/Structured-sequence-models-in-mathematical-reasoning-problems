    "message_2": "To prove that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, we will use the Sylow Theorems.\n\nSince the order of G is 25, we can write it as a prime power: 25 = 5^2. Thus, the Sylow p-subgroups of G are of order 5.\n\nBy the Sylow Theorems, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must satisfy:\n\n1. n_5 â‰¡ 1 (mod 5)\n2. n_5 divides the order of G, which is 25.\n\nThe only possibilities for n_5 are 1 and 25. If n_5 = 1, then there is a unique Sylow 5-subgroup, which we will call H. Since H is of order 5, it is cyclic (as all groups of prime order are cyclic). Since H is the unique Sylow 5-subgroup, it is normal in G. In this case, G is a cyclic group of order 25, generated by H.\n\nNow, let's consider the case when n_5 = 25. In this case, there are 25 Sylow 5-subgroups. Each of these subgroups has 4 non-identity elements, and since the subgroups are distinct, there are a total of 25 * 4 = 100 non-identity elements in these subgroups. However, this is not possible, as G only has 24 non-identity elements. Thus, n_5 cannot be 25.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that n_5 = 1, and G is a cyclic group of order 25, generated by the unique Sylow 5-subgroup. This proves that G is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 5, as required."
