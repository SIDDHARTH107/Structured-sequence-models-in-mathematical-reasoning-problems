    "message_2": "To solve the system of homogeneous linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. First, let's write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n```\n[ 1 -3  2 | 0 ]\n[ 2  1 -4 | 0 ]\n[-3  4  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, let's perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n```\n[ 2  1 -4 | 0 ]\n[ 1 -3  2 | 0 ]\n[-3  4  1 | 0 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace Row 3 with Row 3 + (3/2) * Row 1:\n```\n[ 2  1 -4 | 0 ]\n[ 1 -3  2 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -1  5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n3. Replace Row 2 with Row 2 - (1/2) * Row 1:\n```\n[ 2  1 -4 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -5  6 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -1  5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n4. Multiply Row 2 by -1/5:\n```\n[ 2  1 -4 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -6/5 | 0 ]\n[ 0 -1  5 | 0 ]\n```\n\n5. Replace Row 3 with Row 3 + Row 2:\n```\n[ 2  1 -4 | 0 ]\n[ 0  1 -6/5 | 0 ]\n[ 0  0 19/5 | 0 ]\n```\n\nNow, let's write the system of equations corresponding to the row-echelon form:\n\n```\n2x + y - 4z = 0\ny - (6/5)z = 0\n(19/5)z = 0\n```\n\nFrom the third equation, we get z = 0. Substituting this value into the second equation, we get y = 0. Finally, substituting both y and z into the first equation, we get x = 0.\n\nThus, the solution to the system of homogeneous linear equations is x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0."
