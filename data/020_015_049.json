    "message_1": "A rectangular garden is to be constructed with one side against a wall. If you have exactly 40 meters of fencing material to enclose the other three sides, what dimensions should the garden be to have the largest possible area?",
    "message_2": "Let the length of the garden parallel to the wall be x meters, and the width perpendicular to the wall be y meters. Since we have 40 meters of fencing material, we can write the equation for the perimeter as:\n\nx + 2y = 40\n\nWe can solve for x:\n\nx = 40 - 2y\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the garden, which is given by:\n\nArea = x * y\n\nSubstitute the value of x from the perimeter equation:\n\nArea = (40 - 2y) * y\nArea = 40y - 2y^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area function with respect to y and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Area)/dy = 40 - 4y = 0\n\nSolve for y:\n\n4y = 40\ny = 10\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into the equation for x:\n\nx = 40 - 2(10)\nx = 20\n\nSo, the dimensions of the garden that will give the largest possible area are 20 meters parallel to the wall and 10 meters perpendicular to the wall. The maximum area is 20 * 10 = 200 square meters."
