    "message_2": "The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles required on a surface to embed the graph without any edge crossings. For a complete graph K_n, the genus g can be found using the formula:\n\ng = (n - 3)(n - 4)/12\n\nIn the case of K_{10}, we have n = 10. Plugging this into the formula, we get:\n\ng = (10 - 3)(10 - 4)/12 = (7)(6)/12 = 42/12 = 3.5\n\nHowever, the genus must be an integer, so we round up to the nearest integer:\n\ng = 4\n\nSo, the genus of the complete graph K_{10} is 4."
