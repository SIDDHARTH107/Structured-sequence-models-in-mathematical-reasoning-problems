The general formulas for the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method are as follows:\n\nk1 = h * f(x_n, y_n)\nk2 = h * f(x_n + h/2, y_n + k1/2)\nk3 = h * f(x_n + h/2, y_n + k2/2)\nk4 = h * f(x_n + h, y_n + k3)\ny_{n+1} = y_n + (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4) / 6\n\nGiven the initial value problem y' = 2x + 3 and y(0) = 1, we have:\n\nf(x, y) = 2x + 3\n\nNow, we will perform four iterations:\n\nIteration 1 (x0 = 0, y0 = 1):\nk1 = 0.1 * (2*0 + 3) = 0.3\nk2 = 0.1 * (2*(0 + 0.1/2) + 3) = 0.31\nk3 = 0.1 * (2*(0 + 0.1/2) + 3) = 0.31\nk4 = 0.1 * (2*(0 + 0.1) + 3) = 0.32\ny1 = 1 + (0.3 + 2*0.31 + 2*0.31 + 0.32) / 6 = 1.31\n\nIteration 2 (x1 = 0.1, y1 = 1.31):\nk1 = 0.1 * (2*0.1 + 3) = 0.32\nk2 = 0.1 * (2*(0.1 + 0.1/2) + 3) = 0.33\nk3 = 0.1 * (2*(0.1 + 0.1/2) + 3) = 0.33\nk4 = 0.1 * (2*(0.1 + 0.1) + 3) = 0.34\ny2 = 1.31 + (0.32 + 2*0.33 + 2*0.33 + 0.34) / 6 = 1.63\n\nIteration 3 (x2 = 0.2, y2 = 1.63):\nk1 = 0.1 * (2*0.2 + 3) = 0.34\nk2 = 0.1 * (2*(0.2 + 0.1/2) + 3) = 0.35\nk3 = 0.1 * (2*(0.2 + 0.1/2) + 3) = 0.35\nk4 = 0.1 * (2*(0.2 + 0.1) + 3) = 0.36\ny3 = 1.63 + (0.34 + 2*0.35 + 2*0.35 + 0.36) / 6 = 1.97\n\nIteration 4 (x3 = 0.3, y3 = 1.97):\nk1 = 0.1 * (2*0.3 + 3) = 0.36\nk2 = 0.1 * (2*(0.3 + 0.1/2) + 3) = 0.37\nk3 = 0.1 * (2*(0.3 + 0.1/2) + 3) = 0.37\nk4 = 0.1 * (2*(0.3 + 0.1) + 3) = 0.38\ny4 = 1.97 + (0.36 + 2*0.37 + 2*0.37 + 0.38) / 6 = 2.33\n\nThus, the approximation of y(0.4) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with step size h = 0.1 is y4 = 2.33."
