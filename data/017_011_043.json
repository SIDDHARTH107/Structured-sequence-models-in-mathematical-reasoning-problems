    "message_2": "To find the possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups of a group of order 12, we will use Sylow's Theorems. Let G be a group of order 12, and let p and q be prime numbers such that the order of G is p^a * q^b, where a and b are non-negative integers. In this case, p = 2 and q = 3, so the order of G is 2^2 * 3^1.\n\nSylow's First Theorem states that there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of order p^a and a Sylow q-subgroup of order q^b in G. Thus, there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2^2 = 4 and a Sylow 3-subgroup of order 3^1 = 3 in G.\n\nSylow's Third Theorem states that the number of Sylow p-subgroups, denoted by n_p, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo p. Similarly, the number of Sylow q-subgroups, denoted by n_q, divides the order of G and is congruent to 1 modulo q.\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups (p = 3):\nn_3 divides 12, so the possible values for n_3 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\nn_3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3, so the possible values for n_3 are 1 and 4.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups (p = 2):\nn_2 divides 12, so the possible values for n_2 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\nn_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 2, so the possible values for n_2 are 1 and 3.\n\nNow, we will use this information to determine the isomorphism class of the group G.\n\nCase 1: n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 1\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 2-subgroup. By Sylow's Second Theorem, these subgroups are normal in G. Let P be the Sylow 3-subgroup and Q be the Sylow 2-subgroup. Then, G is the internal direct product of P and Q, so G is isomorphic to P x Q, which is isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_4 (since P and Q are cyclic groups of orders 3 and 4, respectively). Thus, G is isomorphic to Z_12.\n\nCase 2: n_3 = 1 and n_2 = 3\nIn this case, G has a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and three Sylow 2-subgroups. Since the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal in G, G has a normal subgroup of order 3. By the Correspondence Theorem, G has a subgroup of order 4, which must be one of the Sylow 2-subgroups. However, none of the Sylow 2-subgroups are normal in G, so G cannot be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Thus, G is a non-abelian group of order 12. The only non-abelian group of order 12 is A_4, the alternating group on 4 elements. Therefore, G is isomorphic to A_4.\n\nCase 3: n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 1\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, so G is isomorphic to A_4.\n\nCase 4: n_3 = 4 and n_2 = 3\nIn this case, G has four Sylow 3-subgroups and three Sylow 2-subgroups. None of the Sylow subgroups are normal in G, so G cannot be a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Thus, G is a non-abelian group of order 12. The only non-abelian group of order 12 is A_4, the alternating group on 4 elements. Therefore, G is isomorphic to A_4.\n\nIn conclusion, the possible numbers of Sylow 3-subgroups are 1 and 4, and the possible numbers of Sylow 2-subgroups are 1 and 3. The group G can be isomorphic to either Z_12 or A_4, depending on the number of Sylow subgroups."
