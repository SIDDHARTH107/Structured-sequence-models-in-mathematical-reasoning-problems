Calculate the Fourier transform (FT) of the function $f(t)$ and show how the FT can be used to compute the power spectrum of the returns. Additionally, identify the frequency at which the most amount of energy is concentrated, and interpret its physical significance in the context of the economic indicator.",
    "message_2": "To compute the Fourier transform (FT) of the function $f(t)$, we need to apply the following formula:\n\n$$F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt$$\n\nwhere $F(\\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of $f(t)$, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Let's compute the FT of $f(t)$:\n\n$$F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sin(2\\pi t) e^{-t/10} e^{-i\\omega t} dt$$\n\nNow, let's use the Euler's formula to rewrite the sine function:\n\n$$\\sin(2\\pi t) = \\frac{e^{i2\\pi t} - e^{-i2\\pi t}}{2i}$$\n\nSubstitute this into the integral:\n\n$$F(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2i} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (e^{i2\\pi t} - e^{-i2\\pi t}) e^{-t/10} e^{-i\\omega t} dt$$\n\nNow, let's distribute the exponential terms:\n\n$$F(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2i} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(2\\pi - \\frac{1}{10} - i\\omega)t} dt - \\frac{1}{2i} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(-2\\pi - \\frac{1}{10} - i\\omega)t} dt$$\n\nBoth integrals are now in the form of the Laplace transform, which can be computed as follows:\n\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{at} dt = \\frac{1}{a}$$\n\nApplying this to both integrals, we get:\n\n$$F(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2i} \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi - \\frac{1}{10} - i\\omega} - \\frac{1}{-2\\pi - \\frac{1}{10} - i\\omega}\\right)$$\n\nNow, let's compute the power spectrum of the returns, which is the square of the magnitude of the Fourier transform:\n\n$$P(\\omega) = |F(\\omega)|^2$$\n\n$$P(\\omega) = \\left|\\frac{1}{2i} \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi - \\frac{1}{10} - i\\omega} - \\frac{1}{-2\\pi - \\frac{1}{10} - i\\omega}\\right)\\right|^2$$\n\nTo find the frequency at which the most amount of energy is concentrated, we need to find the maximum of the power spectrum. This can be done by taking the derivative of $P(\\omega)$ with respect to $\\omega$ and setting it to zero, then solving for $\\omega$. However, this is a complex function, and finding the maximum analytically may be difficult. Instead, we can use numerical methods to find the maximum of the power spectrum.\n\nThe physical significance of the frequency at which the most amount of energy is concentrated is that it represents the dominant cycle or oscillation in the economic indicator's daily returns. In other words, it is the frequency at which the economic indicator's returns exhibit the most significant periodic behavior. This information can be useful for understanding the underlying dynamics of the economic indicator and potentially for making predictions about its future behavior."
