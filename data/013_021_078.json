    "message_1": "In the Centipede Game, player A and player B are playing a game with a payoff of $100. The game has 10 rounds, and player A starts the game. Each player has the option to either end the game and take half of the payoffs earned so far or continue to the next round. If a player ends the game, the other player receives nothing. If both players continue until the end, the person with the final play will receive the entire $100. If both players are rational and maximizing their payoffs, what will be the outcome of the game?",
    "message_2": "In the Centipede Game, both players are rational and want to maximize their payoffs. We can analyze the game using backward induction, starting from the last round and working our way back to the first round.\n\nIn the last round (round 10), player B has the option to end the game and take the entire $100 or continue and receive nothing (since there are no more rounds). Rational player B will choose to end the game and take the $100.\n\nKnowing this, in round 9, player A has the option to end the game and take $50 (half of the $100) or continue to round 10, where player B will end the game and take the entire $100, leaving player A with nothing. Rational player A will choose to end the game in round 9 and take $50.\n\nSince both players are rational and want to maximize their payoffs, the outcome of the game will be that player A ends the game in round 9 and takes $50, while player B receives nothing."
