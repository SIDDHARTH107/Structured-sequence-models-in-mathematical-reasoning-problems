    "message_2": "To determine the parallel transport of the vector v = (2,3) along the curve C, we first need to find the tangent vector T(x) of the curve C at any point x. The tangent vector can be found by taking the derivative of the curve C with respect to x.\n\nThe curve C is given by the equation y = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x. Differentiating y with respect to x, we get:\n\ndy/dx = 3x^2 - 6x + 2\n\nNow, let's find the tangent vector T(x) at the point P(0,0). Plugging x = 0 into the derivative, we get:\n\nT(0) = 3(0)^2 - 6(0) + 2 = 2\n\nThe tangent vector at P(0,0) is (1, 2).\n\nNext, we need to find the tangent vector T(x) at the point Q(1,0.5). Plugging x = 1 into the derivative, we get:\n\nT(1) = 3(1)^2 - 6(1) + 2 = -1\n\nThe tangent vector at Q(1,0.5) is (1, -1).\n\nNow, we need to find the parallel transport of the vector v = (2,3) along the curve C from P to Q. To do this, we'll project the vector v onto the tangent vector at P, and then project the result onto the tangent vector at Q.\n\nFirst, let's normalize the tangent vectors at P and Q:\n\nT_P_normalized = (1, 2) / ||(1, 2)|| = (1, 2) / sqrt(1^2 + 2^2) = (1/√5, 2/√5)\n\nT_Q_normalized = (1, -1) / ||(1, -1)|| = (1, -1) / sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = (1/√2, -1/√2)\n\nNow, project the vector v onto the normalized tangent vector at P:\n\nv_projected_P = (v • T_P_normalized) * T_P_normalized = ((2,3) • (1/√5, 2/√5)) * (1/√5, 2/√5) = (8/√5) * (1/√5, 2/√5) = (8/5, 16/5)\n\nNext, project the result onto the normalized tangent vector at Q:\n\nv_parallel_transport = (v_projected_P • T_Q_normalized) * T_Q_normalized = ((8/5, 16/5) • (1/√2, -1/√2)) * (1/√2, -1/√2) = (8/5 - 16/5) * (1/√2, -1/√2) = (-8/5) * (1/√2, -1/√2) = (-4/√10, 4/√10)\n\nSo, the parallel transport of the vector v = (2,3) along the curve C from P(0,0) to Q(1,0.5) is (-4/√10, 4/√10)."
