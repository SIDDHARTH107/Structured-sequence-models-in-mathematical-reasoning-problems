    "message_2": "To find the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x - pi/3), we can compare it to the general form of a sinusoidal function: A*sin(B(x - C)) + D, where A is the amplitude, B determines the period, and C is the phase shift. In this case, we have:\n\nA = 3\nB = 2\nC = pi/3\nD = 0\n\n1. Amplitude (A): The amplitude is the absolute value of A, which is |3| = 3. This means the function oscillates between -3 and 3.\n\n2. Period: The period is found by dividing 2π by the absolute value of B, which is |2|. So, the period is 2π/|2| = π. This means the function completes one full oscillation in the interval of length π.\n\n3. Phase Shift (C): The phase shift is given by C, which is pi/3. This means the function is shifted pi/3 units to the right.\n\nNow, let's sketch the graph for one period:\n\n1. Start by drawing the x-axis and y-axis. Label the y-axis with values from -3 to 3.\n\n2. Mark the phase shift on the x-axis (pi/3).\n\n3. Since the period is π, mark the end of one period at x = pi/3 + π = 4pi/3.\n\n4. The maximum and minimum values of the function occur halfway between the phase shift and the end of the period. Mark these points on the x-axis: pi/3 + π/4 = 5pi/12 (maximum) and pi/3 + 3π/4 = 7pi/12 (minimum).\n\n5. Plot the points (pi/3, 0), (5pi/12, 3), (7pi/12, -3), and (4pi/3, 0).\n\n6. Draw a smooth curve through these points, creating a sine wave.\n\nThe graph of the function f(x) = 3sin(2x - pi/3) for one period is now complete."
