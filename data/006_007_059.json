    "message_1": "Suppose the probability that a certain stock price will increase on a given day is 0.6. What is the probability that the stock price will increase on at least 4 out of 5 randomly chosen business days?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having k successes in n trials\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (n choose k)\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial (0.6 in this case)\n- n is the number of trials (5 business days)\n- k is the number of successes (4 or 5 in this case)\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of the stock price increasing exactly 4 out of 5 days:\n\nP(X = 4) = C(5, 4) * (0.6)^4 * (1-0.6)^(5-4)\nP(X = 4) = 5 * (0.6)^4 * (0.4)^1\nP(X = 4) ≈ 0.2592\n\nNow, let's find the probability of the stock price increasing all 5 days:\n\nP(X = 5) = C(5, 5) * (0.6)^5 * (1-0.6)^(5-5)\nP(X = 5) = 1 * (0.6)^5 * (0.4)^0\nP(X = 5) ≈ 0.07776\n\nFinally, we want to find the probability of the stock price increasing at least 4 out of 5 days, which means either 4 or 5 days. We can find this by adding the probabilities we calculated above:\n\nP(X ≥ 4) = P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)\nP(X ≥ 4) ≈ 0.2592 + 0.07776\nP(X ≥ 4) ≈ 0.33696\n\nSo, the probability that the stock price will increase on at least 4 out of 5 randomly chosen business days is approximately 0.33696 or 33.696%."
