    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B, where the profit margins for these products are $5 and $7 per unit, respectively. The company has limited resources of machine hours, and product A requires 2 machine hours while product B requires 3 machine hours to produce. The company has a maximum of 60 machine hours available for production in a day. \n\nIf the company wants to maximize its profit, how many units of each product should it produce in a day?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 7y, subject to the constraint that 2x + 3y ≤ 60 (the total machine hours available).\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the method of integer linear programming. First, we need to find the feasible region, which is the set of all (x, y) pairs that satisfy the constraint:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 60\n\nWe can rewrite the constraint as:\n\ny ≥ (60 - 2x) / 3\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative integers (we cannot produce a negative number of units), the feasible region consists of all integer points (x, y) in the first quadrant such that y ≥ (60 - 2x) / 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the integer point (x, y) in the feasible region that maximizes the profit function P(x, y) = 5x + 7y. We can do this by checking all integer points in the feasible region and computing the profit for each point.\n\nAfter checking all possible integer points, we find that the maximum profit occurs when x = 12 and y = 12. In this case, the company should produce 12 units of product A and 12 units of product B in a day to maximize its profit. The maximum profit will be P(12, 12) = 5(12) + 7(12) = 60 + 84 = $144."
