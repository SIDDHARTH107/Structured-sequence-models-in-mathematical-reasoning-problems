    "message_2": "To solve this system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the system.\n2. Perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n3. Perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the given system of linear equations is:\n\n| 2  3  1 | 9 |\n| 3  2 -1 | 4 |\n| 1 -1  2 | 13|\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nFirst, we will swap Row 1 and Row 3 to get a 1 in the top-left corner:\n\n| 1 -1  2 | 13|\n| 3  2 -1 | 4 |\n| 2  3  1 | 9 |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the 3 in Row 2 and the 2 in Row 3 by subtracting multiples of Row 1:\n\nRow 2 = Row 2 - 3 * Row 1:\n| 1 -1  2 | 13|\n| 0  5 -7 | -35|\n| 2  3  1 | 9 |\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - 2 * Row 1:\n| 1 -1  2 | 13|\n| 0  5 -7 | -35|\n| 0  5 -3 | -17|\n\nNow, we will eliminate the 5 in Row 3 by subtracting Row 2:\n\nRow 3 = Row 3 - Row 2:\n| 1 -1  2 | 13|\n| 0  5 -7 | -35|\n| 0  0  4 | 18|\n\nStep 3: Perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nNow that we have the matrix in row-echelon form, we can perform back substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom the third row, we have:\n4z = 18\nz = 18 / 4\nz = 4.5\n\nFrom the second row, we have:\n5y - 7z = -35\n5y - 7(4.5) = -35\n5y - 31.5 = -35\n5y = -3.5\ny = -3.5 / 5\ny = -0.7\n\nFrom the first row, we have:\nx - y + 2z = 13\nx - (-0.7) + 2(4.5) = 13\nx + 0.7 + 9 = 13\nx = 13 - 9 - 0.7\nx = 3.3\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 3.3, y = -0.7, and z = 4.5."
