    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator:\n3x^2 - 9x\nFactor out the common term 3x:\n3x(x - 3)\n\nDenominator:\n6x - 30\nFactor out the common term 6:\n6(x - 5)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(3x(x - 3)) / (6(x - 5))\n\nNext, we can simplify the expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3 in this case.\n\n(3x(x - 3)) / (6(x - 5)) = (3/6)(x(x - 3)) / (x - 5)\n\nSimplifying the fraction 3/6:\n\n(3/6) = 1/2\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n(1/2)(x(x - 3)) / (x - 5)\n\nOr, you can write it as:\n\n(x(x - 3)) / (2(x - 5))"
