    "message_1": "Consider a square with side length 2. Find the minimum number of triangles required to subdivide the square into smaller triangles such that all the vertices of the smaller triangles lie on the perimeter of the square.",
    "message_2": "To subdivide the square into smaller triangles with all vertices on the perimeter, we can draw two diagonals from one vertex to the other two non-adjacent vertices. This will create four right-angled triangles, each with a hypotenuse equal to the side length of the square (2).\n\nSo, the minimum number of triangles required to subdivide the square into smaller triangles with all vertices on the perimeter is 4."
