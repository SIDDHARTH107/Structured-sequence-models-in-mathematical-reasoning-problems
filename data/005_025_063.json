    "message_1": "A manufacturer claims that the mean weight of the cereal box is 500 grams with a standard deviation of 10 grams. A random sample of 25 cereal boxes was taken and the mean weight was found to be 490 grams. Can the manufacturer's claim be rejected at a significance level of 0.05?",
    "message_2": "To determine if the manufacturer's claim can be rejected at a significance level of 0.05, we will perform a one-sample t-test. \n\nStep 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses\nNull hypothesis (H0): μ = 500 grams (The mean weight of the cereal box is 500 grams)\nAlternative hypothesis (H1): μ ≠ 500 grams (The mean weight of the cereal box is not 500 grams)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic\nThe test statistic for a one-sample t-test is given by the formula:\n\nt = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)\n\nwhere x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nIn this case, x̄ = 490 grams, μ = 500 grams, s = 10 grams, and n = 25.\n\nt = (490 - 500) / (10 / √25) = -10 / (10 / 5) = -10 / 2 = -5\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value\nSince we are performing a two-tailed test at a significance level of 0.05, we need to find the critical value for a t-distribution with 24 degrees of freedom (n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24). Using a t-table or calculator, we find the critical value to be approximately ±2.064.\n\nStep 4: Compare the test statistic to the critical value\nOur test statistic, t = -5, is more extreme than the critical value of ±2.064.\n\nStep 5: Make a decision\nSince the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we can conclude that the manufacturer's claim that the mean weight of the cereal box is 500 grams can be rejected at a significance level of 0.05."
