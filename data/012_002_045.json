    "message_2": "To determine the chromatic number of a graph G with 12 vertices and the degree of each vertex being 4, we can use the following theorem:\n\nTheorem: The chromatic number χ(G) of a graph G is at most Δ(G) + 1, where Δ(G) is the maximum degree of the vertices in G.\n\nIn this case, Δ(G) = 4, since each vertex has a degree of 4. Therefore, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nHowever, we want to find the minimum number of colors needed. To do this, we can use Brooks' theorem:\n\nBrooks' theorem: For any connected graph G, χ(G) ≤ Δ(G), unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n\nSince the degree of each vertex is 4, G cannot be a complete graph (as a complete graph with 12 vertices would have a degree of 11 for each vertex). Additionally, G cannot be an odd cycle, as an odd cycle with 12 vertices would require each vertex to have a degree of 2.\n\nTherefore, by Brooks' theorem, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G is χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) = 4."
