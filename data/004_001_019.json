    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x² - 8x + 4 using the power rule, we will differentiate each term separately.\n\nThe power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, where n is a constant, then the derivative f'(x) = nx^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term 3x², n = 2, so the derivative is (2)(3)x^(2-1) = 6x^(1) = 6x.\n2. For the term -8x, n = 1, so the derivative is (1)(-8)x^(1-1) = -8x^(0) = -8.\n3. For the constant term 4, the derivative is 0, as the derivative of a constant is always 0.\n\nNow, we combine the derivatives of each term:\n\nf'(x) = 6x - 8\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x² - 8x + 4 is f'(x) = 6x - 8."
