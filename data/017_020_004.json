    "message_2": "To find the number of non-isomorphic groups of order 40 that are neither cyclic nor dihedral, we will first find all possible groups of order 40 and then eliminate the cyclic and dihedral groups.\n\nThe prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5. According to the Sylow theorems, we can find the number of Sylow p-subgroups for each prime factor.\n\nFor the 5-Sylow subgroups, the number of such subgroups, n_5, must divide 2^3 = 8, and n_5 ≡ 1 (mod 5). The possible values for n_5 are 1 and 8. If n_5 = 1, there is a unique normal 5-Sylow subgroup. If n_5 = 8, there are 8 non-normal 5-Sylow subgroups.\n\nFor the 2-Sylow subgroups, the number of such subgroups, n_2, must divide 5, and n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). The only possible value for n_2 is 1, so there is a unique normal 2-Sylow subgroup.\n\nSince there is a unique normal 2-Sylow subgroup, the group structure must be a semi-direct product of the 2-Sylow and 5-Sylow subgroups. Let P_2 be the 2-Sylow subgroup and P_5 be the 5-Sylow subgroup. P_2 is of order 8 and P_5 is of order 5.\n\nNow, we consider the two cases for the 5-Sylow subgroups:\n\n1. If n_5 = 1, then P_5 is normal. In this case, we have a semi-direct product of P_2 and P_5. Since P_2 is of order 8, it can be isomorphic to either Z_8, Z_4 × Z_2, or D_4 (cyclic, direct product of two cyclic groups, or dihedral). The action of P_2 on P_5 can be trivial or non-trivial. If the action is trivial, we get the direct product of P_2 and P_5, which can give us three possibilities: Z_40, Z_20 × Z_2, and D_20. The first and the last are cyclic and dihedral, respectively, so we only have one possibility in this case: Z_20 × Z_2.\n\n2. If n_5 = 8, then P_5 is not normal, and we cannot form a semi-direct product. So, there are no non-isomorphic groups in this case.\n\nThus, there is only one non-isomorphic group of order 40 that is neither cyclic nor dihedral: Z_20 × Z_2."
