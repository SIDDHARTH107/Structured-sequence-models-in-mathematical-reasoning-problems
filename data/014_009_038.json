    "message_1": "Consider a Feistel cipher with 16-bit blocks and 8 rounds. If the key length is 32 bits, how many subkeys are needed for the encryption and decryption process?",
    "message_2": "In a Feistel cipher, a subkey is needed for each round of the encryption and decryption process. Since there are 8 rounds in this Feistel cipher, 8 subkeys are needed for the encryption process. The same 8 subkeys are used in the decryption process but in the reverse order. Therefore, a total of 8 subkeys are needed for both encryption and decryption processes."
