    "message_1": "If a Type-A fruit basket contains 5 apples, 3 oranges, and 2 bananas, and a Type-B fruit basket contains 4 apples, 6 oranges, and 3 bananas, how many different fruit baskets can be formed by selecting one type and at most two fruits of each type?",
    "message_2": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of ways to select at most two fruits of each type from a Type-A fruit basket:\n\n1. Apples: 0, 1, or 2 apples can be selected. (3 ways)\n2. Oranges: 0, 1, or 2 oranges can be selected. (3 ways)\n3. Bananas: 0, 1, or 2 bananas can be selected. (3 ways)\n\nSo, there are 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 ways to select at most two fruits of each type from a Type-A fruit basket.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to select at most two fruits of each type from a Type-B fruit basket:\n\n1. Apples: 0, 1, or 2 apples can be selected. (3 ways)\n2. Oranges: 0, 1, or 2 oranges can be selected. (3 ways)\n3. Bananas: 0, 1, or 2 bananas can be selected. (3 ways)\n\nSo, there are 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 ways to select at most two fruits of each type from a Type-B fruit basket.\n\nFinally, we need to find the total number of different fruit baskets that can be formed by selecting one type and at most two fruits of each type:\n\nTotal number of different fruit baskets = Number of ways to select from Type-A + Number of ways to select from Type-B\nTotal number of different fruit baskets = 27 + 27 = 54\n\nTherefore, there are 54 different fruit baskets that can be formed by selecting one type and at most two fruits of each type."
