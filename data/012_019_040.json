    "message_2": "The chromatic index of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color its edges such that no two adjacent edges share the same color.\n\nIn the given graph, there are 6 vertices and 9 edges. The graph is a complete bipartite graph, K(3,3), which means it has two sets of vertices (each with 3 vertices) and every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set.\n\nFor a complete bipartite graph K(m,n), the chromatic index is max(m, n). In this case, it's max(3, 3) = 3.\n\nSo, the chromatic index of the given graph is 3."
