    "message_1": "A furniture company produces tables and chairs which they sell for $50 and $30 respectively. They have a daily production capacity of 80 units and need to decide how many tables and how many chairs to produce each day to maximize their profit. However, they also have a restriction that they can only afford to spend $1000 on materials and they cannot produce partial units. How many tables and chairs should they produce daily to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of tables and y be the number of chairs produced daily.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. x + y ≤ 80 (production capacity constraint)\n2. 50x + 30y ≤ 1000 (material cost constraint)\n\nThe objective is to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 30y.\n\nFirst, we need to find the feasible region that satisfies both constraints. We can rewrite the constraints as:\n\n1. y ≤ 80 - x\n2. y ≤ (1000 - 50x) / 30\n\nNow, we can find the vertices of the feasible region by solving the system of equations formed by the constraints:\n\n1. Intersection of x = 0 and y = 80 - x:\n   (0, 80)\n\n2. Intersection of x = 0 and y = (1000 - 50x) / 30:\n   (0, 0)\n\n3. Intersection of y = 0 and y = 80 - x:\n   (80, 0)\n\n4. Intersection of y = 80 - x and y = (1000 - 50x) / 30:\n   (20, 60)\n\nNow, we can evaluate the profit function P(x, y) at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0, 80) = 50(0) + 30(80) = 2400\n2. P(0, 0) = 50(0) + 30(0) = 0\n3. P(80, 0) = 50(80) + 30(0) = 4000\n4. P(20, 60) = 50(20) + 30(60) = 1000 + 1800 = 2800\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (20, 60), which means the company should produce 20 tables and 60 chairs daily to maximize their profit of $2800."
