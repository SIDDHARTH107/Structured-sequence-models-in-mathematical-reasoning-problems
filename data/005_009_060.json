    "message_1": "Suppose we have two sets of data, A and B. Set A contains the following values: 2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 15. Set B contains the following values: 1, 4, 6, 9, 12, 14.\n\nUsing the Mann-Whitney U test, determine if the two sets of data come from the same population or not. Let the significance level be α = 0.05.",
    "message_2": "To perform the Mann-Whitney U test, we first need to combine the two sets of data and rank them in ascending order:\n\n1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15\n\nNow, assign the ranks to the original sets A and B:\n\nSet A: 2 (rank 2), 5 (rank 4), 8 (rank 6), 10 (rank 8), 13 (rank 10), 15 (rank 12)\nSet B: 1 (rank 1), 4 (rank 3), 6 (rank 5), 9 (rank 7), 12 (rank 9), 14 (rank 11)\n\nNext, find the sum of the ranks for each set:\n\nSum of ranks for set A: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = 42\nSum of ranks for set B: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36\n\nNow, calculate the U values for each set:\n\nU_A = n_A * n_B + (n_A * (n_A + 1)) / 2 - sum of ranks for set A\nU_B = n_A * n_B + (n_B * (n_B + 1)) / 2 - sum of ranks for set B\n\nwhere n_A and n_B are the number of elements in sets A and B, respectively.\n\nU_A = 6 * 6 + (6 * (6 + 1)) / 2 - 42 = 36 - 42 = -6 (since U cannot be negative, we take the minimum value of 0)\nU_B = 6 * 6 + (6 * (6 + 1)) / 2 - 36 = 36 - 36 = 0\n\nThe smaller U value is U_B = 0. Now, we need to compare this value to the critical value for the Mann-Whitney U test at a significance level of α = 0.05. For sample sizes of 6 in both sets, the critical value is 5.\n\nSince the calculated U value (0) is less than the critical value (5), we reject the null hypothesis that the two sets of data come from the same population. Therefore, we can conclude that the two sets of data do not come from the same population at a significance level of α = 0.05."
