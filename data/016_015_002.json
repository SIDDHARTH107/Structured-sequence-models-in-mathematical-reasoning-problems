    "message_2": "A Hilbert curve is a continuous fractal space-filling curve that fills the entire area of a square. The area enclosed by a Hilbert curve of any order within a square is equal to the area of the square itself.\n\nIn this case, the largest square has a side length of 1 unit. The area of a square is calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = side_length × side_length\n\nSo, the area enclosed by a Hilbert curve of order 5 within a square of side length 1 unit is:\n\nArea = 1 × 1 = 1 square unit"
