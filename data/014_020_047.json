    "message_2": "To encrypt the plaintext message \"MATHEMATICS\" using the Vigenere cipher with the key \"CRYPTO\", we first need to repeat the key to match the length of the plaintext message. In this case, the repeated key is \"CRYPTOCRY\".\n\nNow, we use the Vigenere cipher table to find the corresponding ciphertext letter for each plaintext letter using the repeated key:\n\nM (with C): (12 + 2) mod 26 = 14 -> O\nA (with R): (0 + 17) mod 26 = 17 -> R\nT (with Y): (19 + 24) mod 26 = 17 -> R\nH (with P): (7 + 15) mod 26 = 22 -> W\nE (with T): (4 + 19) mod 26 = 23 -> X\nM (with O): (12 + 14) mod 26 = 0 -> A\nA (with C): (0 + 2) mod 26 = 2 -> C\nT (with R): (19 + 17) mod 26 = 10 -> K\nI (with Y): (8 + 24) mod 26 = 6 -> G\nC (with P): (2 + 15) mod 26 = 17 -> R\n\nSo, the resulting ciphertext message is \"ORRWXACKGR\"."
