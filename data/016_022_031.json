    "message_2": "The Sierpinski pyramid, also known as the Sierpinski tetrahedron or Sierpinski triangle, is a fractal structure that is built by recursively subdividing a tetrahedron (a pyramid with a triangular base) into four smaller tetrahedra.\n\nAt each level, the number of triangles increases by a factor of 4. So, to find the total number of triangles at the seventh level, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal triangles = Initial triangles * (Multiplier ^ (Level - 1))\n\nIn this case, the initial number of triangles is 1 (since the first level contains only one triangle), the multiplier is 4 (since the number of triangles increases by a factor of 4 at each level), and the level is 7.\n\nTotal triangles = 1 * (4 ^ (7 - 1))\nTotal triangles = 1 * (4 ^ 6)\nTotal triangles = 1 * 4096\nTotal triangles = 4096\n\nSo, there are 4096 triangles in the seventh level of the Sierpinski pyramid."
