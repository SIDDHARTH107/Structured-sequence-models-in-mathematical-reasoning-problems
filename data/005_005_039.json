    "message_1": "Suppose that the weights of apples in a certain orchard are normally distributed with a mean weight of 150 grams and a standard deviation of 20 grams. What is the probability that a randomly chosen apple from this orchard weighs between 130 and 170 grams?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen apple weighs between 130 and 170 grams, we can use the Z-score formula and the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe Z-score formula is:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere X is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we'll find the Z-scores for 130 grams and 170 grams.\n\nFor 130 grams:\nZ1 = (130 - 150) / 20\nZ1 = -20 / 20\nZ1 = -1\n\nFor 170 grams:\nZ2 = (170 - 150) / 20\nZ2 = 20 / 20\nZ2 = 1\n\nNow, we'll use the standard normal distribution table to find the probabilities corresponding to these Z-scores.\n\nFor Z1 = -1, the probability is 0.1587 (or 15.87%).\nFor Z2 = 1, the probability is 0.8413 (or 84.13%).\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly chosen apple weighs between 130 and 170 grams, we'll subtract the probability of Z1 from the probability of Z2:\n\nP(130 < X < 170) = P(Z2) - P(Z1)\nP(130 < X < 170) = 0.8413 - 0.1587\nP(130 < X < 170) = 0.6826\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen apple weighs between 130 and 170 grams is approximately 0.6826 or 68.26%."
