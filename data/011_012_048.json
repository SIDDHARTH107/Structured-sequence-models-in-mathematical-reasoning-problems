    "message_2": "To find the number of students who take either English or French (but not both), we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nTotal students taking English or French = Students taking English + Students taking French - Students taking both English and French\n\nTotal students = 20 (English) + 30 (French) - 15 (Both)\n\nTotal students = 50 - 15 = 35\n\nSo, 35 students take either English or French (but not both)."
