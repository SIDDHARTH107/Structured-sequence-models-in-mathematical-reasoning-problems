    "message_1": "Suppose a company hires an agent to sell a product. The agent has two choices: work hard or slack off. If the agent works hard, the probability of selling the product is 0.8, and if the agent slacks off, the probability of selling the product is 0.2. The company offers the agent a commission of 10% of the sales price if the product is sold. The sales price is $100. How much commission will the agent earn if they choose to work hard, and how much commission will they earn if they choose to slack off? And which choice should the agent make in order to maximize their expected commission earnings?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the expected commission earnings for each choice, we need to multiply the probability of selling the product by the commission amount.\n\nFirst, let's find the commission amount: 10% of the sales price ($100) is $10.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected commission earnings for each choice:\n\n1. If the agent works hard:\nExpected commission = Probability of selling the product * Commission amount\n= 0.8 * $10\n= $8\n\n2. If the agent slacks off:\nExpected commission = Probability of selling the product * Commission amount\n= 0.2 * $10\n= $2\n\nSo, if the agent chooses to work hard, they can expect to earn $8 in commission, and if they choose to slack off, they can expect to earn $2 in commission.\n\nTo maximize their expected commission earnings, the agent should choose to work hard, as the expected commission is higher ($8) compared to slacking off ($2)."
