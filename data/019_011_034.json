    "message_2": "Let's first find the number of students who take both math and physics. Since 60% of the students who take math also take physics, we can calculate this number as follows:\n\nNumber of students who take both math and physics = 60% of 200 students\n= (60/100) * 200\n= 120 students\n\nSo, 120 students take both math and physics."
