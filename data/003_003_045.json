    "message_2": "To find the sine, cosine, and tangent of a 135-degree angle using the unit circle, we first need to convert the angle to radians. \n\n135 degrees * (π / 180) = 3π / 4 radians\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of the point on the unit circle that corresponds to this angle. Since 135 degrees is in the second quadrant, we can find the reference angle (the angle between the terminal side of the angle and the x-axis) by subtracting 135 degrees from 180 degrees:\n\n180 - 135 = 45 degrees\n\nThe reference angle is 45 degrees, which is π / 4 radians. We know that for a 45-degree angle, the coordinates on the unit circle are (±√2 / 2, ±√2 / 2). Since we are in the second quadrant, the x-coordinate will be negative, and the y-coordinate will be positive. Therefore, the coordinates for a 135-degree angle on the unit circle are (-√2 / 2, √2 / 2).\n\nNow we can find the sine, cosine, and tangent:\n\n1. Sine (sin) is the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle:\nsin(135°) = sin(3π / 4) = √2 / 2\n\n2. Cosine (cos) is the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle:\ncos(135°) = cos(3π / 4) = -√2 / 2\n\n3. Tangent (tan) is the ratio of the sine to the cosine:\ntan(135°) = tan(3π / 4) = (sin(135°)) / (cos(135°)) = (√2 / 2) / (-√2 / 2) = -1\n\nSo, the sine, cosine, and tangent of a 135-degree angle are:\n\nsin(135°) = √2 / 2\ncos(135°) = -√2 / 2\ntan(135°) = -1"
