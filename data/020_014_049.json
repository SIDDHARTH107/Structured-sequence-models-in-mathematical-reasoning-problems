    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two types of products, A and B, using two machines. Each product's production requires a certain amount of time on each machine. Machine 1 can work at most 60 hours per week, while Machine 2 can work for a maximum of 45 hours per week. Also, product A cannot be produced for more than 10 hours a week. The company wants to maximize its profit by determining the number of units of products A and B to produce each week while satisfying the constraints. \n\nThe profit per unit for product A is $20, and for product B, it is $30. Given the following data, determine the number of units of product A and product B that the company should produce each week:\n\n- Product A requires 3 hours of Machine 1 and 2 hours of Machine 2 to produce a unit.\n- Product B requires 2 hours of Machine 1 and 4 hours of Machine 2 to produce a unit. \n\nWhat is the maximum profit the company can achieve per week?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A and y be the number of units of product B. The constraints can be written as:\n\n3x + 2y ≤ 60 (Machine 1 constraint)\n2x + 4y ≤ 45 (Machine 2 constraint)\nx ≤ 10 (Product A constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nProfit = 20x + 30y\n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use the graphical method by plotting the constraints and finding the feasible region.\n\nThe constraints can be rewritten as:\n\ny ≤ (60 - 3x) / 2\ny ≤ (45 - 2x) / 4\nx ≤ 10\n\nPlotting these constraints, we find the feasible region. The vertices of the feasible region are (0, 0), (0, 11.25), (10, 5), and (20, 0). We can now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nProfit at (0, 0) = 20(0) + 30(0) = $0\nProfit at (0, 11.25) = 20(0) + 30(11.25) = $337.50\nProfit at (10, 5) = 20(10) + 30(5) = $350\nProfit at (20, 0) = 20(20) + 30(0) = $400\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (20, 0), but this point is not in the feasible region due to the constraint x ≤ 10. Therefore, the maximum profit occurs at the vertex (10, 5), with a profit of $350 per week.\n\nThe company should produce 10 units of product A and 5 units of product B each week to achieve a maximum profit of $350 per week."
