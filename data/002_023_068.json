    "message_2": "The surface area of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * r²\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the radius of the sphere is 5 cm, we can plug in the value into the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * (5 cm)²\n\nSurface Area = 4 * π * 25 cm²\n\nSurface Area = 100π cm²\n\nNow, we can approximate the value of π as 3.14159:\n\nSurface Area ≈ 100 * 3.14159 cm²\n\nSurface Area ≈ 314.159 cm²\n\nRounded to one decimal place, the surface area of the sphere is approximately 314.2 cm²."
