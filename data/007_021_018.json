Choose a random function f(x) modulo N, usually f(x) = (x^2 + c) mod N, where c is a constant.\n2. Choose random initial values for x and y.\n3. Iterate the function to find a non-trivial factor of N.\n\nLet's choose f(x) = (x^2 + 1) mod N and initial values x = 2 and y = 2.\n\nNow, we will iterate the function and calculate gcd(x - y, N) until we find a non-trivial factor.\n\n1st iteration:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 1) mod N = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod N = 26\ngcd(5 - 2, N) = gcd(3, N) = 1\n\n2nd iteration:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod N = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(26) = (26^2 + 1) mod N = 82\ngcd(26 - 2, N) = gcd(24, N) = 1\n\n3rd iteration:\nx = f(x) = (26^2 + 1) mod N = 82\ny = f(f(y)) = f(82) = (82^2 + 1) mod N = 5\ngcd(82 - 2, N) = gcd(80, N) = 1\n\n4th iteration:\nx = f(x) = (82^2 + 1) mod N = 5\ny = f(f(y)) = f(5) = (5^2 + 1) mod N = 26\ngcd(5 - 2, N) = gcd(3, N) = 1\n\n5th iteration:\nx = f(x) = (5^2 + 1) mod N = 26\ny = f(f(y)) = f(26) = (26^2 + 1) mod N = 82\ngcd(26 - 2, N) = gcd(24, N) = 1\n\nAt this point, we can see that the algorithm is stuck in a cycle and not finding a non-trivial factor. To break the cycle, we can change the constant c in the function f(x) or change the initial values of x and y.\n\nLet's change the constant c to 2, so f(x) = (x^2 + 2) mod N, and keep the initial values x = 2 and y = 2.\n\n1st iteration:\nx = f(x) = (2^2 + 2) mod N = 6\ny = f(f(y)) = f(6) = (6^2 + 2) mod N = 38\ngcd(6 - 2, N) = gcd(4, N) = 1\n\n2nd iteration:\nx = f(x) = (6^2 + 2) mod N = 38\ny = f(f(y)) = f(38) = (38^2 + 2) mod N = 127\ngcd(38 - 2, N) = gcd(36, N) = 1\n\n3rd iteration:\nx = f(x) = (38^2 + 2) mod N = 127\ny = f(f(y)) = f(127) = (127^2 + 2) mod N = 6\ngcd(127 - 2, N) = gcd(125, N) = 1\n\n4th iteration:\nx = f(x) = (127^2 + 2) mod N = 6\ny = f(f(y)) = f(6) = (6^2 + 2) mod N = 38\ngcd(6 - 2, N) = gcd(4, N) = 1\n\n5th iteration:\nx = f(x) = (6^2 + 2) mod N = 38\ny = f(f(y)) = f(38) = (38^2 + 2) mod N = 127\ngcd(38 - 2, N) = gcd(36, N) = 1\n\nAgain, we are stuck in a cycle. Let's change the initial values of x and y to x = 3 and y = 3.\n\n1st iteration:\nx = f(x) = (3^2 + 2) mod N = 11\ny = f(f(y)) = f(11) = (11^2 + 2) mod N = 123\ngcd(11 - 3, N) = gcd(8, N) = 1\n\n2nd iteration:\nx = f(x) = (11^2 + 2) mod N = 123\ny = f(f(y)) = f(123) = (123^2 + 2) mod N = 11\ngcd(123 - 3, N) = gcd(120, N) = 1\n\n3rd iteration:\nx = f(x) = (123^2 + 2) mod N = 11\ny = f(f(y)) = f(11) = (11^2 + 2) mod N = 123\ngcd(11 - 3, N) = gcd(8, N) = 1\n\nOnce again, we are stuck in a cycle.

However, we have tried several combinations of constants and initial values without finding a non-trivial factor. In this case, it is likely that N is a prime number or a product of two large prime numbers, which makes it difficult for Pollard's rho algorithm to find a factor.\n\nIn fact, N = 113 * 127, which are both prime numbers. The smallest factor of N is 113."
