    "message_2": "The scaling factor is the ratio of the largest frond's height to the original fern's height. To find the scaling factor, divide the height of the largest frond by the height of the original fern:\n\nScaling factor = (Height of largest frond) / (Height of original fern)\n\nScaling factor = 10 units / 100 units\n\nScaling factor = 0.1\n\nSo, the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern is 0.1."
