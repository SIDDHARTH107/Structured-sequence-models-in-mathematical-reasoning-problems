    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = (4x² - 6x + 1)³ using the chain rule, we first identify the outer function and the inner function. In this case, the outer function is g(u) = u³ and the inner function is h(x) = 4x² - 6x + 1.\n\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. Mathematically, this is written as:\n\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of the outer and inner functions:\n\ng'(u) = d(u³)/du = 3u²\nh'(x) = d(4x² - 6x + 1)/dx = 8x - 6\n\nNow, we apply the chain rule:\n\nf'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x) = 3(4x² - 6x + 1)² * (8x - 6)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (4x² - 6x + 1)³ with respect to x is:\n\nf'(x) = 3(4x² - 6x + 1)² * (8x - 6)"
