    "message_1": "A manufacturing company has three machines, M1, M2, and M3, which produce the same item. The company wants to know which machine is better in terms of efficiency. A sample of 30 items produced by each machine is taken randomly and the following data is obtained:\n\nMachine M1: Mean= 15, SD= 3\n\nMachine M2: Mean= 17, SD= 6\n\nMachine M3: Mean= 18, SD= 4\n\nUse discriminant analysis to determine which machine is better in terms of efficiency, given that the efficiency of the machines is measured in terms of the average time it takes to produce one item.",
    "message_2": "In this case, we want to determine which machine is more efficient, meaning which machine takes the least amount of time to produce an item on average. Since lower mean time indicates higher efficiency, we can use discriminant analysis to compare the means of the three machines.\n\nDiscriminant analysis is a statistical method used to determine which group a new observation belongs to, based on a set of known observations. In this case, we have three groups (machines) with known means and standard deviations.\n\nTo perform discriminant analysis, we need to calculate the discriminant function for each machine. The discriminant function is given by:\n\nD(x) = -0.5 * ln(Σ) - 0.5 * (x - μ)' * Σ^(-1) * (x - μ) + ln(P)\n\nwhere x is the observation, μ is the mean, Σ is the covariance matrix, and P is the prior probability of the group.\n\nSince we are comparing the means of the machines, we can simplify the discriminant function to:\n\nD(x) = -0.5 * (x - μ)^2 / σ^2 + ln(P)\n\nwhere σ is the standard deviation.\n\nNow, we can calculate the discriminant function for each machine:\n\nD1(x) = -0.5 * (x - 15)^2 / 3^2 + ln(1/3)\nD2(x) = -0.5 * (x - 17)^2 / 6^2 + ln(1/3)\nD3(x) = -0.5 * (x - 18)^2 / 4^2 + ln(1/3)\n\nSince we want to find the machine with the highest efficiency (lowest mean time), we can compare the discriminant functions at the means of the machines:\n\nD1(15) = -0.5 * (15 - 15)^2 / 3^2 + ln(1/3) = ln(1/3)\nD2(17) = -0.5 * (17 - 17)^2 / 6^2 + ln(1/3) = ln(1/3)\nD3(18) = -0.5 * (18 - 18)^2 / 4^2 + ln(1/3) = ln(1/3)\n\nSince all the discriminant functions have the same value at the means, we can compare the means directly:\n\nMean(M1) = 15\nMean(M2) = 17\nMean(M3) = 18\n\nSince lower mean time indicates higher efficiency, Machine M1 is the most efficient machine."
