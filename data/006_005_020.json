    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of getting exactly one head in two flips of a fair coin, we can use the formula for probability: P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThere are 4 possible outcomes when flipping a fair coin twice: HH, HT, TH, and TT. Out of these, there are 2 outcomes with exactly one head: HT and TH.\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly one head in two flips is:\n\nP(1 head) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 2/4 = 1/2 or 50%."
