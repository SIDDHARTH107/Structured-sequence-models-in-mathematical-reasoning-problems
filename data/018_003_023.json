    "message_2": "To prove that the union of sets A and B is a superset of each set, we need to show that every element in set A and set B is also in the union of sets A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the union of sets A and B. The union of two sets is the set containing all elements from both sets, without duplicates. In this case, the union of sets A and B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}\n\nNow, let's check if every element in set A is in the union:\n\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n2 ∈ A and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of set A are in the union, A ∪ B is a superset of A.\n\nNext, let's check if every element in set B is in the union:\n\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince all elements of set B are in the union, A ∪ B is a superset of B.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the union of sets A and B, A ∪ B, is a superset of each set A and B."
