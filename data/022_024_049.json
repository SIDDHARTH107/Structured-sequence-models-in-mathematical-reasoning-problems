Use the initial conditions $u(x,0)=f(x)$ and the fact that $\\pi^2 = 9.8696$.\n\nNote: This problem involves solving the heat equation using the method of separation of variables.",
    "message_2": "To solve the heat equation using the method of separation of variables, we assume that the solution can be written as a product of two functions, one depending only on $x$ and the other depending only on $t$. Let $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation, we get:\n\n$X(x)T'(t) = kX''(x)T(t)$\n\nNow, we divide both sides by $X(x)T(t)$:\n\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{kT(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we'll call $-\\lambda$:\n\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{kT(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\\lambda$\n\nNow we have two ordinary differential equations:\n\n1. $T'(t) + k\\lambda T(t) = 0$\n2. $X''(x) + \\lambda X(x) = 0$\n\nWe'll solve these two equations separately.\n\nFor equation (1), we have a first-order linear ODE. The general solution is given by:\n\n$T(t) = Ce^{-k\\lambda t}$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nFor equation (2), we have a second-order linear ODE with constant coefficients. Since the equation has a positive constant term, we expect the solutions to be sinusoidal. The general solution is given by:\n\n$X(x) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0$ for $t>0$. This implies that $X(0) = X(L) = 0$. Using the form of $X(x)$, we get:\n\n$X(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$\n$X(L) = A\\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda}L) + B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}L) = B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}L) = 0$\n\nSince $A=0$, we have $X(x) = B\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}x)$. The second boundary condition implies that $\\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda}L) = 0$. This means that $\\sqrt{\\lambda}L = n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. Thus, $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$.\n\nNow, we can write the general solution as:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n e^{-k\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$\n\nTo find the coefficients $C_n$, we use the initial condition $u(x,0) = f(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$. This implies that:\n\n$\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$\n\nComparing the two sides, we see that $C_1 = 1$ and $C_n = 0$ for $n > 1$. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n$u(x,t) = e^{-k\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$\n\nUsing the given value for $\\pi^2 = 9.8696$, we have:\n\n$u(x,t) = e^{-k\\left(\\frac{9.8696}{L^2}\\right) t}\\sin\\left(\\frac{3.1416 x}{L}\\right)$\n\nThis is the temperature $u(x,t)$ at any later time $t>0$ for $0\\leq x\\leq L$."
