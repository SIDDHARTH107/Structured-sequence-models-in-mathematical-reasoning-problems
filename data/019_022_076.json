    "message_2": "To find the final cost of the toy after the 20% discount is applied, we first need to calculate the amount of the discount. \n\n20% of $75 is:\n\n0.20 * $75 = $15\n\nNow, subtract the discount amount from the original price of the toy:\n\n$75 - $15 = $60\n\nThe final cost of the toy after the 20% discount is applied is $60."
