    "message_2": "To show that G is cyclic, we need to find an element g in G such that the order of g is 17. Since the order of G is 17, which is a prime number, we can use Lagrange's theorem to help us find a generator for G.\n\nLagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup H of a group G must divide the order of G. In our case, the order of G is 17, so the order of any subgroup H of G must divide 17. Since 17 is prime, the only divisors of 17 are 1 and 17. Therefore, the possible orders of subgroups of G are 1 and 17.\n\nNow, let's consider an element g in G, where g is not the identity element. The subgroup generated by g, denoted as <g>, is the set of all powers of g: {g^0, g^1, g^2, ..., g^(n-1)}, where n is the order of g. Since g is not the identity element, the order of g cannot be 1. By Lagrange's theorem, the only other possibility for the order of g is 17.\n\nSo, the order of g is 17, which means that <g> contains 17 elements. Since the order of G is also 17, we can conclude that <g> = G. This means that G is generated by the single element g, and therefore G is a cyclic group.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that G is cyclic by finding a generator g for G, where the order of g is 17."
