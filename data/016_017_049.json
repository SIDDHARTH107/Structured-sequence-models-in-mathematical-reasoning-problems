    "message_2": "The Heighway dragon curve is a fractal created by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPerimeter = Initial segment length * (2^n)\n\nIn this case, the initial segment length is 1 unit, and we want to find the perimeter after 10 iterations. So, we have:\n\nPerimeter = 1 * (2^10)\n\nPerimeter = 1 * 1024\n\nPerimeter = 1024 units\n\nSo, the perimeter of the Heighway dragon curve after undergoing 10 iterations is 1024 units."
