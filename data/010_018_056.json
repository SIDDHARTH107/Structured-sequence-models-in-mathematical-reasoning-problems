If there are 5 critical points in total and 2 of them are saddles, what are the indices of the saddles?",
    "message_2": "A Morse-Smale complex on the surface of a sphere can be described by the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, which states that the sum of the indices of all critical points is equal to the Euler characteristic of the manifold. In this case, the manifold is a sphere, which has an Euler characteristic of 2.\n\nWe are given that there are 5 critical points in total: 1 maximum with index 2, 1 minimum with index 0, and 2 saddles with unknown indices. Let the indices of the saddles be x and y.\n\nAccording to the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, the sum of the indices of all critical points should be equal to the Euler characteristic of the sphere:\n\n2 (maximum) + 0 (minimum) + x (saddle 1) + y (saddle 2) = 2 (Euler characteristic)\n\nNow we need to solve for x and y:\n\n2 + x + y = 2\n\nx + y = 0\n\nSince x and y are indices of saddles, they must be equal to 1 (as saddles have index 1 in a 2-dimensional manifold). Therefore, the only possible solution is x = 1 and y = 1. So, the indices of the saddles are both 1."
