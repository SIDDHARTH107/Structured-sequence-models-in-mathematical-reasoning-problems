    "message_2": "To solve the absolute value equation |3x - 2| = 7, we need to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 3x - 2 = 7\nIn this case, we simply solve for x:\n3x = 9\nx = 3\n\nCase 2: 3x - 2 = -7\nIn this case, we also solve for x:\n3x = -5\nx = -5/3\n\nSo the solutions to the absolute value equation |3x - 2| = 7 are x = 3 and x = -5/3."
