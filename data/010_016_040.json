    "message_2": "Since $A$ and $B$ intersect transversally in $k$ points, we can use the intersection product in homology to compute the intersection number $A \\cdot B$. Let $[A] \\in H_p(X)$ and $[B] \\in H_q(X)$ be the homology classes of $A$ and $B$, respectively, where $p + q = n$. \n\nThe intersection product is defined as:\n\n$A \\cdot B = \\langle [A] \\cap [B], [X] \\rangle$\n\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the Kronecker product and $\\cap$ denotes the cap product. Since $A$ and $B$ intersect transversally in $k$ points, the cap product $[A] \\cap [B]$ is a sum of $k$ points, each with a coefficient of either $+1$ or $-1$ depending on the orientation of the intersection.\n\nLet $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k$ be the $k$ intersection points of $A$ and $B$. Then, we can write the cap product as:\n\n$[A] \\cap [B] = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i [x_i]$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon_i = \\pm 1$ depending on the orientation of the intersection at $x_i$. Now, we can compute the intersection number as:\n\n$A \\cdot B = \\langle [A] \\cap [B], [X] \\rangle = \\langle \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i [x_i], [X] \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i \\langle [x_i], [X] \\rangle$\n\nSince the Kronecker product is linear, we have:\n\n$A \\cdot B = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i \\langle [x_i], [X] \\rangle$\n\nNow, for each $x_i$, the Kronecker product $\\langle [x_i], [X] \\rangle$ is either $0$ or $\\pm 1$. Since $A$ and $B$ intersect transversally, the Kronecker product is non-zero for each $x_i$, and we have:\n\n$A \\cdot B = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i$\n\nThus, the intersection number $A \\cdot B$ is the sum of the orientations of the $k$ intersection points."
