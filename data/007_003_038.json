    "message_2": "To determine the remainder when x is divided by y using modular arithmetic notation, we can write it as:\n\nx ≡ r (mod y)\n\nwhere x = 17, y = 26, and r is the remainder.\n\nSince 17 is less than 26, the remainder is simply the value of x:\n\n17 ≡ 17 (mod 26)\n\nSo, the remainder is 17."
