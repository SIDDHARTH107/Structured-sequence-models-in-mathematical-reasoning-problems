    "message_2": "To find the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by the equation f(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0, we need to compute the partial derivatives of f with respect to x, y, and z, and then find the points where all three partial derivatives are simultaneously zero.\n\nFirst, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂x = 3x^2 - 3yz\n∂f/∂y = 3y^2 - 3xz\n∂f/∂z = 3z^2 - 3xy\n\nNow, we need to find the points (x, y, z) where all three partial derivatives are zero:\n\n3x^2 - 3yz = 0\n3y^2 - 3xz = 0\n3z^2 - 3xy = 0\n\nWe can simplify these equations by dividing each by 3:\n\nx^2 - yz = 0\ny^2 - xz = 0\nz^2 - xy = 0\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible solutions:\n\n1. If x = y = z = 0, then all three equations are satisfied, and (0, 0, 0) is a singular point.\n\n2. If x = y ≠ 0, then the first and second equations become:\n\nx^2 - x^2 = 0\nx^2 - x^2 = 0\n\nThese equations are always true, so we only need to consider the third equation:\n\nz^2 - x^2 = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied when z = x or z = -x. So, we have two more singular points: (x, x, x) and (x, x, -x) for any x ≠ 0.\n\n3. If x = z ≠ 0, then the first and third equations become:\n\nx^2 - x^2 = 0\nx^2 - x^2 = 0\n\nThese equations are always true, so we only need to consider the second equation:\n\ny^2 - x^2 = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied when y = x or y = -x. So, we have two more singular points: (x, x, x) and (x, -x, x) for any x ≠ 0.\n\n4. If y = z ≠ 0, then the second and third equations become:\n\ny^2 - y^2 = 0\ny^2 - y^2 = 0\n\nThese equations are always true, so we only need to consider the first equation:\n\nx^2 - y^2 = 0\n\nThis equation is satisfied when x = y or x = -y. So, we have two more singular points: (y, y, y) and (-y, y, y) for any y ≠ 0.\n\nIn conclusion, the singular points of the algebraic variety defined by the equation x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = 0 are:\n\n(0, 0, 0)\n(x, x, x) for any x ≠ 0\n(x, x, -x) for any x ≠ 0\n(x, -x, x) for any x ≠ 0\n(-y, y, y) for any y ≠ 0"
