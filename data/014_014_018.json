    "message_1": "If the key for a Playfair cipher is \"MATHS\" and the plaintext to be encrypted is \"HELLO WORLD\", what is the encrypted message?",
    "message_2": "To encrypt the message \"HELLO WORLD\" using the Playfair cipher with the key \"MATHS\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a 5x5 grid and fill it with the key and the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding J, which is usually combined with I in the Playfair cipher). The grid will look like this:\n\n   M  A  T  H  S\n   B  C  D  E  F\n   G  I  K  L  N\n   O  P  Q  R  U\n   V  W  X  Y  Z\n\n2. Split the plaintext into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, insert an 'X' between them. If the plaintext has an odd number of letters, add an 'X' at the end. In this case, the digraphs are: HE LX LO WO RX LD.\n\n3. For each digraph, apply the Playfair encryption rules:\n\n   - If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their immediate right (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters immediately below them (wrapping around if necessary).\n   - If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\n4. Encrypt the digraphs:\n\n   - HE -> GM\n   - LX -> YN\n   - LO -> FN\n   - WO -> UO\n   - RX -> YD\n   - LD -> MC\n\n5. Combine the encrypted digraphs to get the final encrypted message: \"GMYNFNUOYDMC\"."
