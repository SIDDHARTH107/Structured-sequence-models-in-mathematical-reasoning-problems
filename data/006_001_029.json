    "message_2": "To calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 heads when flipping a coin 5 times, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes (in this case, heads)\n- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5 coin flips)\n- k is the number of successes (in this case, 3 heads)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time (also written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\")\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the probability of getting heads, which is 0.5 for a fair coin)\n- q is the probability of failure (in this case, the probability of getting tails, which is also 0.5 for a fair coin)\n\nPlugging in the values for our problem:\n\nP(X = 3) = (5C3) * (0.5^3) * (0.5^(5-3))\n\nFirst, we calculate 5C3:\n\n5C3 = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\n    = 5! / (3! * 2!)\n    = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\n    = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1)\n    = 10\n\nNow, we can plug this back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 3) = 10 * (0.5^3) * (0.5^2)\n         = 10 * 0.125 * 0.25\n         = 10 * 0.03125\n         = 0.3125\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads when flipping a coin 5 times is 0.3125 or 31.25%."
