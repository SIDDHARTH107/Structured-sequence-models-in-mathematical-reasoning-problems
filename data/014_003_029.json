    "message_2": "To encrypt the message '12' using ElGamal encryption, Alice needs to choose a random number k (1 < k < p-1). Let's assume k = 4 for this example (note that the choice of k can change the ciphertext pair, but decryption will still work correctly).\n\nNow, Alice computes the ciphertext pair (a, b) as follows:\n\n1. Compute a = g^k mod p\n   a = 5^4 mod 23\n   a = 625 mod 23\n   a = 2\n\n2. Compute b = (y^k * m) mod p\n   b = (8^4 * 12) mod 23\n   b = (4096 * 12) mod 23\n   b = 49152 mod 23\n   b = 10\n\nSo, the ciphertext pair (a, b) is (2, 10)."
