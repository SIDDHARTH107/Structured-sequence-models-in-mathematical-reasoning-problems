    "message_1": "A weather model predicts that the average temperature in a city during the summer will increase by 2°C every day. If the initial temperature is 30°C, what will be the temperature after 10 days? How does the butterfly effect affect this prediction?",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature after 10 days, we can use the formula:\n\nFinal temperature = Initial temperature + (Number of days * Increase per day)\n\nFinal temperature = 30°C + (10 * 2°C)\n\nFinal temperature = 30°C + 20°C\n\nFinal temperature = 50°C\n\nSo, the predicted temperature after 10 days will be 50°C.\n\nHowever, the butterfly effect is a concept in chaos theory that suggests that small changes in initial conditions can lead to drastically different outcomes in complex systems, like the weather. The butterfly effect got its name from the idea that the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil could set off a chain of events that leads to a tornado in Texas.\n\nIn the context of this weather prediction, the butterfly effect implies that even a tiny change in the initial conditions, such as a slight variation in temperature or air pressure, could lead to a completely different temperature outcome after 10 days. This is because weather systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions and involve many interconnected variables.\n\nAs a result, while the mathematical prediction suggests that the temperature will be 50°C after 10 days, the actual temperature could be significantly different due to the butterfly effect and the inherent unpredictability of weather systems."
