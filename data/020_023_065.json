    "message_1": "Suppose an investor has $100,000 to invest in two different stocks, stock A and stock B. The expected return from stock A is 10% per year and the risk (standard deviation) is 15%, while the expected return from stock B is 7% per year and the risk is 12%. The correlation between the two stocks is 0.3. Determine the optimal portfolio allocation that maximizes the expected return while minimizing the risk.",
    "message_2": "To determine the optimal portfolio allocation, we need to find the weights of stock A and stock B that maximize the expected return while minimizing the risk. Let's denote the weight of stock A as w_A and the weight of stock B as w_B. Since the total investment is $100,000, we have:\n\nw_A + w_B = 1\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (R_p) can be calculated as:\n\nR_p = w_A * R_A + w_B * R_B\n\nwhere R_A and R_B are the expected returns of stock A and stock B, respectively.\n\nThe risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio (σ_p) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nσ_p^2 = (w_A * σ_A)^2 + (w_B * σ_B)^2 + 2 * w_A * w_B * σ_A * σ_B * ρ_AB\n\nwhere σ_A and σ_B are the standard deviations of stock A and stock B, respectively, and ρ_AB is the correlation between the two stocks.\n\nNow, we need to find the optimal weights (w_A and w_B) that maximize the expected return while minimizing the risk. This can be done using the concept of the efficient frontier. The efficient frontier is a set of portfolios that have the highest expected return for a given level of risk. To find the optimal weights, we can use the following formula:\n\nw_A = (σ_B^2 - ρ_AB * σ_A * σ_B) / (σ_A^2 + σ_B^2 - 2 * ρ_AB * σ_A * σ_B)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nw_A = (0.12^2 - 0.3 * 0.15 * 0.12) / (0.15^2 + 0.12^2 - 2 * 0.3 * 0.15 * 0.12)\nw_A ≈ 0.573\n\nNow, we can find the weight of stock B:\n\nw_B = 1 - w_A\nw_B ≈ 1 - 0.573\nw_B ≈ 0.427\n\nSo, the optimal portfolio allocation is approximately 57.3% in stock A and 42.7% in stock B. This allocation maximizes the expected return while minimizing the risk."
