    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for a math student to solve related to the Playfair cipher:\n\nUsing the Playfair cipher with the keyword \"MATHEMATICS\", encrypt the message \"MEET ME TONIGHT\" and then decrypt it back to its original form.",
    "message_2": "First, let's create the 5x5 Playfair cipher table using the keyword \"MATHEMATICS\". We remove duplicate letters from the keyword and fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding J, which is combined with I in the Playfair cipher).\n\n1. Remove duplicate letters from the keyword: MATHEICS\n2. Fill the remaining spaces with the rest of the alphabet (excluding J): MATHEICSBDFGKLNOPQRUVWXYZ\n\nNow, the 5x5 table looks like this:\n\nM A T H E\nI C S B D\nF G K L N\nO P Q R U\nV W X Y Z\n\nNext, we'll encrypt the message \"MEET ME TONIGHT\". We need to break the message into digraphs (pairs of letters). If a pair has the same letter, we insert an X between them. Also, we'll add an X at the end if there's an odd number of letters.\n\nME ET ME TO NI GH TX\n\nNow, we'll encrypt each digraph using the Playfair cipher rules:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its right (wrapping around if necessary).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one below it (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nME -> YF\nET -> CU\nME -> YF\nTO -> GS\nNI -> UV\nGH -> KL\nTX -> QD\n\nThe encrypted message is: YFCUYFGSUVKLQD\n\nNow, let's decrypt the message back to its original form using the inverse of the encryption rules:\n\n1. If both letters are in the same row, replace each letter with the one to its left (wrapping around if necessary).\n2. If both letters are in the same column, replace each letter with the one above it (wrapping around if necessary).\n3. If the letters form a rectangle, replace each letter with the one in its own row but in the other letter's column.\n\nYF -> ME\nCU -> ET\nYF -> ME\nGS -> TO\nUV -> NI\nKL -> GH\nQD -> TX\n\nThe decrypted message is: MEETMEXTONIGHTX\n\nFinally, we remove the inserted X's to get the original message: MEET ME TONIGHT"
