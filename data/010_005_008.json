    "message_2": "To prove this, we will show that there exist two path components, one containing x and the other containing y.\n\nLet A be the set of all points in X that can be connected to x by a path. Since x is in A, A is non-empty. We will show that A is both open and closed in X.\n\nFirst, we show that A is open. Let a ∈ A. Since X is a topological space, there exists an open neighborhood U of a such that U ⊆ X. For any point u ∈ U, there exists a path from x to a (by definition of A) and a path from a to u (since U is an open neighborhood). By concatenating these two paths, we obtain a path from x to u. Therefore, u ∈ A, and so U ⊆ A. This shows that A is open in X.\n\nNext, we show that A is closed. Let b be a limit point of A. Then, there exists a sequence of points {b_n} in A such that b_n → b. For each b_n, there exists a path from x to b_n. Since X is a topological space, the limit of the sequence of paths also exists and is a path from x to b. Therefore, b ∈ A, and A contains all its limit points. This shows that A is closed in X.\n\nNow, since X is connected, the only subsets of X that are both open and closed are the empty set and X itself. Since A is non-empty (it contains x) and A is both open and closed, we must have A = X.\n\nSince x and y are distinct points in X, there exists a path from x to y. Let P be the path component containing x. By definition, P contains all points in X that can be connected to x by a path. Since there exists a path from x to y, y is also in P.\n\nThus, we have found two path components of X: one containing x and the other containing y. Note that these path components may not be distinct if x and y are in the same path component. However, the problem statement only asks for the existence of at least two path components containing x and y respectively, which we have shown."
