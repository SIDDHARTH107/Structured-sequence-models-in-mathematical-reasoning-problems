    "message_2": "First, let's find the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted as A ∆ B. The symmetric difference is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n\nA ∆ B = {1, 3} (since 1 is in A but not in B, and 3 is in B but not in A)\n\nSimilarly, B ∆ A = {1, 3} (since symmetric difference is commutative)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∆ B) × A and (B ∆ A) × A.\n\n(A ∆ B) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\n(B ∆ A) × A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}\n\nNow, let's find the product of these two Cartesian products:\n\n((A ∆ B) × A) × ((B ∆ A) × A) = {((1, 1), (1, 1)), ((1, 1), (1, 2)), ((1, 1), (3, 1)), ((1, 1), (3, 2)), ((1, 2), (1, 1)), ((1, 2), (1, 2)), ((1, 2), (3, 1)), ((1, 2), (3, 2)), ((3, 1), (1, 1)), ((3, 1), (1, 2)), ((3, 1), (3, 1)), ((3, 1), (3, 2)), ((3, 2), (1, 1)), ((3, 2), (1, 2)), ((3, 2), (3, 1)), ((3, 2), (3, 2))}\n\nNow, let's check if the symmetric difference is associative with respect to the Cartesian product. For this, we need to check if (A ∆ B) ∆ A = A ∆ (B ∆ A).\n\n(A ∆ B) ∆ A = {1, 3} ∆ {1, 2} = {2, 3}\n\nA ∆ (B ∆ A) = {1, 2} ∆ {1, 3} = {2, 3}\n\nSince (A ∆ B) ∆ A = A ∆ (B ∆ A), the symmetric difference is associative with respect to the Cartesian product in this case. However, this does not prove that it is always associative for all sets A and B. It just shows that it is associative for this specific example."
