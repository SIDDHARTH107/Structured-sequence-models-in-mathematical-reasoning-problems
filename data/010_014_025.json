Find the cohomology groups H^n(X, Z) of X, where Z is the integer ring, for n = 0,1,2, up to the highest degree possible.",
    "message_2": "To compute the cohomology groups of X, we will use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. Let's denote the two solid tori as A and B, and their intersection (the glued boundary) as C. Then, we have the following short exact sequence of chain complexes:\n\n0 → Z[C] → Z[A] ⊕ Z[B] → Z[X] → 0\n\nwhere Z[C] is generated by the meridian and longitude circles of the glued boundary. Now, we can compute the cohomology groups of A, B, and C. Since A and B are both solid tori, their cohomology groups are the same as the cohomology groups of a 3-dimensional ball:\n\nH^0(A, Z) = H^0(B, Z) = Z\nH^1(A, Z) = H^1(B, Z) = 0\nH^2(A, Z) = H^2(B, Z) = 0\nH^3(A, Z) = H^3(B, Z) = Z\n\nFor C, which is a torus, the cohomology groups are:\n\nH^0(C, Z) = Z\nH^1(C, Z) = Z ⊕ Z\nH^2(C, Z) = Z\n\nNow, we can apply the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to compute the cohomology groups of X:\n\nH^0(X, Z) = Z (since the map from H^0(A, Z) ⊕ H^0(B, Z) to H^0(C, Z) is surjective)\n\nH^1(X, Z) = Ker(Δ: H^1(C, Z) → H^2(A, Z) ⊕ H^2(B, Z)) / Im(α: H^1(A, Z) ⊕ H^1(B, Z) → H^1(C, Z))\nSince H^1(A, Z) = H^1(B, Z) = 0, Im(α) = 0. Also, Δ is the zero map, so Ker(Δ) = H^1(C, Z) = Z ⊕ Z. Therefore, H^1(X, Z) = Z ⊕ Z.\n\nH^2(X, Z) = Ker(β: H^2(A, Z) ⊕ H^2(B, Z) → H^2(C, Z)) / Im(Δ: H^1(C, Z) → H^2(A, Z) ⊕ H^2(B, Z))\nSince H^2(A, Z) = H^2(B, Z) = 0, Ker(β) = 0. Also, Δ is the zero map, so Im(Δ) = 0. Therefore, H^2(X, Z) = 0.\n\nH^3(X, Z) = Ker(γ: H^3(A, Z) ⊕ H^3(B, Z) → H^3(C, Z)) / Im(β: H^2(A, Z) ⊕ H^2(B, Z) → H^2(C, Z))\nSince H^3(C, Z) = 0, γ is the zero map, so Ker(γ) = 0. Also, β is the zero map, so Im(β) = 0. Therefore, H^3(X, Z) = 0.\n\nIn summary, the cohomology groups of X are:\n\nH^0(X, Z) = Z\nH^1(X, Z) = Z ⊕ Z\nH^2(X, Z) = 0\nH^3(X, Z) = 0"
