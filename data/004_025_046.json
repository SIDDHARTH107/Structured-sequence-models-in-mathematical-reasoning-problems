    "message_1": "A particle is moving in a straight line with a velocity given by the function v(t)=3t² − 6t, where v is measured in meters per second and t is measured in seconds. Find the acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds.",
    "message_2": "To find the acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds, we need to find the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time, which will give us the acceleration function. \n\nThe velocity function is v(t) = 3t² - 6t. \n\nNow, let's find the derivative of v(t) with respect to t:\n\ndv/dt = d(3t² - 6t)/dt\n\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\ndv/dt = 6t - 6\n\nNow, we have the acceleration function a(t) = 6t - 6. To find the acceleration at t = 2 seconds, we simply plug in t = 2 into the acceleration function:\n\na(2) = 6(2) - 6\na(2) = 12 - 6\na(2) = 6\n\nSo, the acceleration of the particle at t = 2 seconds is 6 meters per second squared."
