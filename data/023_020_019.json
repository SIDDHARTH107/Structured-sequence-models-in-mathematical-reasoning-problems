    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) with respect to the interval [-1, 1] and period 2, we first need to extend the function to be periodic with period 2. Since the given function is defined only for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, we can extend it to be an odd function over the interval [-1, 1] as follows:\n\nf(x) = x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1\nf(x) = -x for -1 ≤ x < 0\n\nNow, we can find the Fourier series of this odd function. Since it's an odd function, the Fourier series will only contain sine terms. The Fourier series of an odd function is given by:\n\nf(x) = ∑(b_n * sin(nπx/L))\n\nwhere L is half the period (in this case, L = 1), and the coefficients b_n are given by:\n\nb_n = (2/L) * ∫(f(x) * sin(nπx/L) dx) from -L to L\n\nFor our function, we have:\n\nb_n = 2 * [∫(-x * sin(nπx) dx) from -1 to 0 + ∫(x * sin(nπx) dx) from 0 to 1]\n\nTo compute the integrals, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = x and dv = sin(nπx) dx, then du = dx and v = -(1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du\n\nFor the first integral:\n∫(-x * sin(nπx) dx) from -1 to 0 = [x * (1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx)] from -1 to 0 - ∫[(1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx) dx] from -1 to 0\n= [0 - (-1) * (1/(nπ)) * cos(-nπ)] - [(1/(nπ)) * sin(nπx)/(nπ)] from -1 to 0\n= (1/(nπ)) * (1 + cos(nπ)) - [(1/(n^2π^2)) * (sin(nπ) - sin(-nπ))]\n\nFor the second integral:\n∫(x * sin(nπx) dx) from 0 to 1 = [x * (-(1/(nπ))) * cos(nπx)] from 0 to 1 - ∫[-(1/(nπ)) * cos(nπx) dx] from 0 to 1\n= [1 * (-(1/(nπ))) * cos(nπ) - 0] - [-(1/(nπ)) * sin(nπx)/(nπ)] from 0 to 1\n= (-(1/(nπ))) * cos(nπ) - [(1/(n^2π^2)) * (sin(nπ) - sin(0))]\n\nAdding the two integrals, we get:\n\nb_n = 2 * [(1/(nπ)) * (1 + cos(nπ)) - (1/(nπ)) * cos(nπ) - (1/(n^2π^2)) * 2 * sin(nπ)]\n= (2/(nπ)) * (1 - cos(nπ))\n\nNow, we can write the Fourier series for f(x):\n\nf(x) = ∑[(2/(nπ)) * (1 - cos(nπ)) * sin(nπx)]\n\nThis is the Fourier series of the function f(x) = x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) with respect to the interval [-1, 1] and period 2."
