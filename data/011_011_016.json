    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula, which is a generalization of the binomial coefficient formula. The multinomial coefficient formula is:\n\nC(n; n1, n2, ..., nk) = n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the sizes of the groups.\n\nIn this case, we have 12 employees (n = 12) and we want to form three teams of equal sizes (n1 = n2 = n3 = 4). So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nC(12; 4, 4, 4) = 12! / (4! * 4! * 4!)\n\nNow, we can compute the factorials:\n\n12! = 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 479001600\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n\nSo, the multinomial coefficient is:\n\nC(12; 4, 4, 4) = 479001600 / (24 * 24 * 24) = 4950\n\nTherefore, there are 4950 ways to form three teams of equal sizes from 12 employees."
