    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface obtained by rotating the curve y = x^2 about the x-axis, we first need to find the parametric representation of the surface. Let's denote the parametric representation as (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v)).\n\nSince the curve is given by y = x^2 and we are rotating it about the x-axis, we can use the following parametric representation:\n\nx(u, v) = u\ny(u, v) = u^2 * cos(v)\nz(u, v) = u^2 * sin(v)\n\nNow, we need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface. To do this, we need to compute the partial derivatives of x(u,v), y(u,v), and z(u,v) with respect to u and v.\n\nx_u = ∂x/∂u = 1\nx_v = ∂x/∂v = 0\ny_u = ∂y/∂u = 2u * cos(v)\ny_v = ∂y/∂v = -u^2 * sin(v)\nz_u = ∂z/∂u = 2u * sin(v)\nz_v = ∂z/∂v = u^2 * cos(v)\n\nNow, let's find the first fundamental form coefficients:\n\nE = <(x_u, y_u, z_u), (x_u, y_u, z_u)> = 1^2 + (2u * cos(v))^2 + (2u * sin(v))^2 = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <(x_u, y_u, z_u), (x_v, y_v, z_v)> = 1 * 0 + (2u * cos(v)) * (-u^2 * sin(v)) + (2u * sin(v)) * (u^2 * cos(v)) = 0\nG = <(x_v, y_v, z_v), (x_v, y_v, z_v)> = 0^2 + (-u^2 * sin(v))^2 + (u^2 * cos(v))^2 = u^4\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form coefficients by computing the second partial derivatives:\n\nx_uu = ∂²x/∂u² = 0\nx_uv = ∂²x/∂u∂v = 0\nx_vv = ∂²x/∂v² = 0\ny_uu = ∂²y/∂u² = 2 * cos(v)\ny_uv = ∂²y/∂u∂v = -2u * sin(v)\ny_vv = ∂²y/∂v² = -u^2 * cos(v)\nz_uu = ∂²z/∂u² = 2 * sin(v)\nz_uv = ∂²z/∂u∂v = 2u * cos(v)\nz_vv = ∂²z/∂v² = -u^2 * sin(v)\n\nNow, let's find the normal vector N:\n\nN = (x_u, y_u, z_u) x (x_v, y_v, z_v) = (1, 2u * cos(v), 2u * sin(v)) x (0, -u^2 * sin(v), u^2 * cos(v))\nN = (2u^3 * cos^2(v) + 2u^3 * sin^2(v), -2u * sin(v), 2u * cos(v))\nN = (2u^3, -2u * sin(v), 2u * cos(v))\n\nNow, let's find the second fundamental form coefficients:\n\nL = <N, (x_uu, y_uu, z_uu)> = (2u^3, -2u * sin(v), 2u * cos(v)) • (0, 2 * cos(v), 2 * sin(v)) = 4u * cos^2(v) + 4u * sin^2(v) = 4u\nM = <N, (x_uv, y_uv, z_uv)> = (2u^3, -2u * sin(v), 2u * cos(v)) • (0, -2u * sin(v), 2u * cos(v)) = 4u^2 * sin(v) * cos(v) - 4u^2 * sin(v) * cos(v) = 0\nN = <N, (x_vv, y_vv, z_vv)> = (2u^3, -2u * sin(v), 2u * cos(v)) • (0, -u^2 * cos(v), -u^2 * sin(v)) = -2u^3 * cos^2(v) - 2u^3 * sin^2(v) = -2u^3\n\nNow, let's find the Gaussian curvature K and the mean curvature H:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2) = (4u * (-2u^3) - 0^2) / ((1 + 4u^2) * u^4 - 0^2) = -8u^4 / (u^4 + 4u^6) = -8 / (1 + 4u^2)\nH = (LE + NG - 2MF) / 2(EG - F^2) = (4u * (1 + 4u^2) - (-2u^3) * u^4 - 2 * 0) / 2((1 + 4u^2) * u^4 - 0^2) = (4u + 8u^3 + 2u^7) / (2 * (1 + 4u^2) * u^4)\n\nNow, let's find the sectional curvature at the point (1,1):\n\nK(1,1) = -8 / (1 + 4 * 1^2) = -8 / 5\n\nSo, the sectional curvature of the surface obtained by rotating the curve y = x^2 about the x-axis at the point (1,1) is -8/5."
