    "message_2": "To find the velocity function, we need to take the first derivative of the displacement function with respect to time:\n\n$v(t) = \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = -6\\sin(2t) - 4\\cos(2t)$\n\nNow, to find the acceleration function, we need to take the first derivative of the velocity function with respect to time:\n\n$a(t) = \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = -12\\cos(2t) + 8\\sin(2t)$\n\nNow, let's find the amplitude, frequency, and period of the motion.\n\nThe general form of a simple harmonic oscillator is:\n\n$x(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi)$\n\nwhere A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nWe can rewrite the given displacement function as:\n\n$x(t) = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2}\\cos(2t + \\tan^{-1}(-\\frac{2}{3}))$\n\n$x(t) = \\sqrt{13}\\cos(2t - \\tan^{-1}(\\frac{2}{3}))$\n\nNow, we can see that the amplitude A is:\n\n$A = \\sqrt{13}$\n\nThe angular frequency ω is:\n\n$\\omega = 2$\n\nTo find the frequency (f) and period (T), we can use the following relationships:\n\n$\\omega = 2\\pi f$\n\n$T = \\frac{1}{f}$\n\nSo, the frequency is:\n\n$f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} = \\frac{2}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{\\pi}$\n\nAnd the period is:\n\n$T = \\frac{1}{f} = \\pi$\n\nIn summary, the velocity function is $v(t) = -6\\sin(2t) - 4\\cos(2t)$, the acceleration function is $a(t) = -12\\cos(2t) + 8\\sin(2t)$, the amplitude is $\\sqrt{13}$, the frequency is $\\frac{1}{\\pi}$, and the period is $\\pi$."
