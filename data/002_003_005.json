    "message_2": "The total surface area of a cube can be found using the formula:\n\nSurface area = 6 × (side length)²\n\nIn this case, the side length is 5 cm. So, the surface area is:\n\nSurface area = 6 × (5 cm)²\nSurface area = 6 × 25 cm²\nSurface area = 150 cm²\n\nThe total surface area of the cube is 150 square centimeters."
