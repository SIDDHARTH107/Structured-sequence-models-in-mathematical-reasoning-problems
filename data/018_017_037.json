    "message_2": "First, let's find the Cartesian product A x B:\n\nA x B = {(1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3)}\n\nNow, let's find the symmetric difference of (A x B) and B:\n\n(A x B) △ B = {(1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3)} △ {1, 3}\n\nSince elements of (A x B) are ordered pairs and elements of B are single numbers, there are no common elements between the two sets. Therefore, the symmetric difference is the union of the two sets:\n\n(A x B) △ B = {(1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), 1, 3}\n\nNext, let's find the symmetric difference of B and A:\n\nB △ A = {1, 3} △ {1, 2} = {2, 3} (1 is the common element and is removed)\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (B △ A) and B:\n\n(B △ A) x B = {2, 3} x {1, 3} = {(2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3)}\n\nWe can see that (A x B) △ B ≠ (B △ A) x B:\n\n{(1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), 1, 3} ≠ {(2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3)}\n\nThus, the Cartesian product of two sets is not associative with respect to symmetric difference."
