    "message_2": "To find the seasonal indices using the additive method, we first need to calculate the average revenue for the entire year and then find the difference between each month's revenue and the average revenue. Finally, we'll average these differences for each month to get the seasonal indices.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the average revenue for the entire year.\nTotal revenue = 120 + 150 + 135 + 160 + 175 + 200 + 195 + 220 + 250 + 275 + 300 + 320 = 2400\nAverage revenue = 2400 / 12 = 200\n\nStep 2: Find the difference between each month's revenue and the average revenue.\n| Month | Revenue | Difference |\n|-------|---------|------------|\n| Jan   | 120     | -80        |\n| Feb   | 150     | -50        |\n| Mar   | 135     | -65        |\n| Apr   | 160     | -40        |\n| May   | 175     | -25        |\n| Jun   | 200     | 0          |\n| Jul   | 195     | -5         |\n| Aug   | 220     | 20         |\n| Sep   | 250     | 50         |\n| Oct   | 275     | 75         |\n| Nov   | 300     | 100        |\n| Dec   | 320     | 120        |\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average difference for each month to get the seasonal indices.\n| Month | Seasonal Index |\n|-------|----------------|\n| Jan   | -80            |\n| Feb   | -50            |\n| Mar   | -65            |\n| Apr   | -40            |\n| May   | -25            |\n| Jun   | 0              |\n| Jul   | -5             |\n| Aug   | 20             |\n| Sep   | 50             |\n| Oct   | 75             |\n| Nov   | 100            |\n| Dec   | 120            |\n\nThese seasonal indices represent the average difference between each month's revenue and the overall average revenue. They can be used to adjust the time series data for seasonality or to forecast future revenues."
