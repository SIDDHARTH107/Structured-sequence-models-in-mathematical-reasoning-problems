    "message_1": "A pizza has a diameter of 16 inches. What is the perimeter of a sector of the pizza that has a central angle of 60 degrees? Round your answer to the nearest tenth of an inch.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a sector, we need to find the length of the arc and add it to the lengths of the two radii. The formula for the length of an arc is:\n\nArc length = (central angle/360) * 2πr\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and the central angle is given in degrees.\n\nFirst, we need to find the radius of the pizza. Since the diameter is 16 inches, the radius is half of that, which is 8 inches.\n\nNow we can find the arc length:\n\nArc length = (60/360) * 2π(8)\nArc length = (1/6) * 16π\nArc length = 16π/6 ≈ 8.38 inches\n\nNow we can find the perimeter of the sector:\n\nPerimeter = arc length + 2 * radius\nPerimeter = 8.38 + 2 * 8\nPerimeter ≈ 8.38 + 16\nPerimeter ≈ 24.38 inches\n\nRounded to the nearest tenth of an inch, the perimeter of the sector is approximately 24.4 inches."
