    "message_1": "Consider two companies A and B producing the same type of product. The market demand for this product is given by the equation P = 100 - Q, where P is the price, and Q is the combined quantity produced by both companies. Each company has a constant marginal cost of $20 per unit. Assuming that they act independently, what quantity of product will each company produce and what will be the market price?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we need to find the profit-maximizing quantity for each company and the resulting market price. Since both companies have the same marginal cost, we can treat them as symmetric firms. \n\nLet q_A and q_B be the quantities produced by companies A and B, respectively. Then, the combined quantity produced by both companies is Q = q_A + q_B. The market demand equation is P = 100 - Q.\n\nThe revenue for company A is given by R_A = P * q_A = (100 - Q) * q_A = (100 - (q_A + q_B)) * q_A. The marginal cost for company A is $20 per unit, so the total cost for company A is C_A = 20 * q_A. The profit for company A is given by π_A = R_A - C_A.\n\nTo find the profit-maximizing quantity for company A, we need to take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q_A and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(π_A)/dq_A = d((100 - (q_A + q_B)) * q_A - 20 * q_A)/dq_A = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n100 - 2*q_A - q_B - 20 = 0\n\nRearranging the terms, we have:\n\nq_A = (80 - q_B)/2\n\nSince the firms are symmetric, we can also write the profit-maximizing quantity for company B as:\n\nq_B = (80 - q_A)/2\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for q_B from the second equation into the first equation:\n\nq_A = (80 - ((80 - q_A)/2))/2\n\nSolving for q_A, we get:\n\nq_A = 40\n\nSince the firms are symmetric, we also have:\n\nq_B = 40\n\nNow we can find the market price by substituting the quantities back into the market demand equation:\n\nP = 100 - Q = 100 - (q_A + q_B) = 100 - (40 + 40) = 100 - 80 = 20\n\nSo, each company will produce 40 units of the product, and the market price will be $20."
