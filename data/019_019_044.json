    "message_2": "The Decision Problem for a 5-tuple (n, k, a, b, c) can be solved using the Cook-Levin theorem, which states that the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is NP-complete. In this case, we are given a Boolean formula with n variables, k clauses, a maximum clause length, b maximum absolute value of any integer, and c maximum number of times a variable appears in any clause.\n\nTo solve the Decision Problem, we can use the brute-force approach, which involves checking all possible assignments of truth values to the n variables. There are 2^n possible assignments, and for each assignment, we need to check if it satisfies all k clauses.\n\nEach clause can have at most a literals, and each literal can have at most b different values. Therefore, the maximum number of different literals in a clause is a * b. Since a variable can appear at most c times in any clause, the maximum number of steps required to check if a clause is satisfied is a * b * c.\n\nSo, the maximum number of steps required to solve the Decision Problem for a 5-tuple (n, k, a, b, c) is:\n\n2^n * k * a * b * c\n\nThis is an exponential time complexity, which is expected since the SAT problem is NP-complete."
