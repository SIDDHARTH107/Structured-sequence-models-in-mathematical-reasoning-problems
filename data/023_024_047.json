    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function f(x), we need to determine the coefficients a_n and b_n in the following Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[f(x)] dx from -π to π\n\nSince f(x) is defined differently for 0 < x < π and π < x < 2π, we need to split the integral:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[1] dx from 0 to π + ∫[-1] dx from π to 2π]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [x | from 0 to π - x | from π to 2π]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [π - 0 - (2π - π)]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [π - π] = 0\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * cos(nx)] dx from -π to π\n\nAgain, we need to split the integral:\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[cos(nx)] dx from 0 to π + ∫[-cos(nx)] dx from π to 2π]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [sin(nx)/n | from 0 to π - (-sin(nx)/n) | from π to 2π]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [sin(nπ)/n - sin(0) - (-sin(2nπ)/n + sin(nπ)/n)]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [2sin(nπ)/n] = 0 (since sin(nπ) = 0 for all integer values of n)\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[f(x) * sin(nx)] dx from -π to π\n\nSplitting the integral:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[sin(nx)] dx from 0 to π + ∫[-sin(nx)] dx from π to 2π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-cos(nx)/n | from 0 to π + cos(nx)/n | from π to 2π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-cos(nπ)/n + cos(0) + cos(2nπ)/n - cos(nπ)/n]\n\nFor n is odd, b_n = (1/π) * [-(-1)/n + 1 + 1/n - (-1)/n] = (2/π) * (1/n)\n\nFor n is even, b_n = (1/π) * [-1/n + 1 + 1/n - 1/n] = 0\n\nSo, the Fourier series of f(x) in the range -π ≤ x ≤ π is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(2/π) * (1/n) * sin(nx)] for odd values of n\n\nThis is an odd function, as expected, since the original function f(x) is also odd."
