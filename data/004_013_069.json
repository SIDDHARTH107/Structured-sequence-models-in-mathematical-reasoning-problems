    "message_2": "To find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 5 on the interval [-3, 4], we need to find the critical points of the function and evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.\n\nFirst, let's find the first derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx(2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 5) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero:\n\n6x^2 - 18x + 12 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing by 6:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = 0\n\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 2.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:\n\nf(-3) = 2(-3)^3 - 9(-3)^2 + 12(-3) + 5 = -54\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 12(1) + 5 = 10\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 12(2) + 5 = 9\nf(4) = 2(4)^3 - 9(4)^2 + 12(4) + 5 = 69\n\nComparing these values, we find that the maximum value of the function on the interval [-3, 4] is 69 at x = 4, and the minimum value is -54 at x = -3."
