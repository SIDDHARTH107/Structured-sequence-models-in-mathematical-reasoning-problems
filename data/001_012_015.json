    "message_2": "To simplify the given rational expression, we can first factor out the common terms in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nNumerator: (3x² - 9xy)\nFactor out 3x: 3x(x - 3y)\n\nDenominator: (6x² - 12xy)\nFactor out 6x: 6x(x - 2y)\n\nNow, the rational expression becomes:\n\n(3x(x - 3y)) / (6x(x - 2y))\n\nWe can now simplify by canceling out the common terms:\n\n3x/6x = 1/2\n\nSo, the simplified rational expression is:\n\n(1/2)(x - 3y) / (x - 2y)"
