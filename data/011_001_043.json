    "message_2": "To choose a president, vice-president, and treasurer from the committee, we will use the permutation formula:\n\nnPr = n! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of members (5 in this case) and r is the number of positions to be filled (3 in this case: president, vice-president, and treasurer).\n\n5P3 = 5! / (5 - 3)!\n\n5P3 = 5! / 2!\n\n5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120\n2! = 2 × 1 = 2\n\n5P3 = 120 / 2 = 60\n\nSo, there are 60 different ways to choose a president, vice-president, and treasurer from the committee."
