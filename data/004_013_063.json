    "message_2": "To find the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 4 on the interval [0, 3], we first need to find the critical points of the function. Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of the function:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x + 4)\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n6x^2 - 18x + 12 = 0\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing by 6:\n\nx^2 - 3x + 2 = 0\n\nNow, let's factor the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0\n\nThis gives us two critical points: x = 1 and x = 2.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval [0, 3]:\n\nf(0) = 2(0)^3 - 9(0)^2 + 12(0) + 4 = 4\nf(1) = 2(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 + 12(1) + 4 = 2 - 9 + 12 + 4 = 9\nf(2) = 2(2)^3 - 9(2)^2 + 12(2) + 4 = 16 - 36 + 24 + 4 = 8\nf(3) = 2(3)^3 - 9(3)^2 + 12(3) + 4 = 54 - 81 + 36 + 4 = 13\n\nComparing the values of the function at the critical points and the endpoints, we find that the maximum value of the function on the interval [0, 3] is 13, which occurs at x = 3."
