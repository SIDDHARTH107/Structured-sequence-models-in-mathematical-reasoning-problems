    "message_2": "To determine if B is a compact subset of X, we need to show that every open cover of B has a finite subcover. Recall that a set is compact if and only if every open cover has a finite subcover.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary open cover of B. This open cover is a collection of open sets in X, say {U_i} for i ∈ I, where I is an index set, such that B ⊆ ⋃_{i ∈ I} U_i.\n\nSince 0 ∈ B, there exists an open set U_0 ∈ {U_i} such that 0 ∈ U_0. Since U_0 is an open set in the topological space X, there exists an ε > 0 such that the interval (0 - ε, 0 + ε) is contained in U_0. Let ε' = min(ε, 1). Then the interval (0, ε') is contained in U_0.\n\nNow, let's consider the elements of A. Since 1/n → 0 as n → ∞, there exists a positive integer N such that for all n > N, we have 1/n < ε'. Therefore, for all n > N, the elements 1/n are contained in U_0.\n\nNow, for each of the remaining elements 1/1, 1/2, ..., 1/N, there exists an open set U_j ∈ {U_i} containing each of these elements. Thus, we have a finite subcover {U_0, U_1, ..., U_N} of the open cover {U_i} that covers B.\n\nSince we have shown that every open cover of B has a finite subcover, B is a compact subset of X."
