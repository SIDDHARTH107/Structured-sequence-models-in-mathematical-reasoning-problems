    "message_2": "To determine the number of different groups of order 8, we will use the following facts:\n\n1. If a group has order p^n, where p is prime and n is a positive integer, then the group is a p-group.\n2. Every group of order p^2 is either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n3. If a group has order 2^n, where n is a positive integer, then the group has a normal subgroup of order 2^(n-1).\n\nNow, let's consider a group G of order 8. Since 8 = 2^3, G is a 2-group. By fact 3, G has a normal subgroup H of order 4. Since 4 = 2^2, H is a 2-group, and by fact 2, H is either cyclic (isomorphic to C4) or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 (isomorphic to C2 x C2).\n\nCase 1: H is cyclic (isomorphic to C4)\nIn this case, G has a normal cyclic subgroup of order 4. Since the index of H in G is 2, H is also a normal subgroup of G. By the Fundamental Theorem of Group Theory, G is either a direct or semidirect product of H and a subgroup K of order 2. If G is a direct product of H and K, then G is isomorphic to C4 x C2, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8. If G is a semidirect product of H and K, then G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4.\n\nCase 2: H is isomorphic to C2 x C2\nIn this case, G has a normal subgroup of order 4 that is not cyclic. Let K be a subgroup of G of order 2. Then, G is a semidirect product of H and K. Since H is not cyclic, G cannot be isomorphic to the cyclic group C8. Also, G cannot be isomorphic to the dihedral group D4, because D4 has a cyclic normal subgroup of order 4. Therefore, G must be isomorphic to a different group of order 8, which is the quaternion group Q8.\n\nIn conclusion, there are three different groups of order 8, and they are isomorphic to the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4."
