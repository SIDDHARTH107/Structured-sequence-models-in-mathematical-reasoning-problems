What is the probability that exactly 15 cars will pass through this intersection during the next hour?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the formula for the Poisson distribution:\n\nP(X = k) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of observing exactly k cars in one hour\n- λ is the average number of cars per hour (in this case, 10)\n- k is the number of cars we want to find the probability for (in this case, 15)\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nP(X = 15) = (e^(-10) * 10^15) / 15!\n\nFirst, we need to calculate 15! (15 factorial):\n\n15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × ... × 2 × 1 = 1,307,674,368,000\n\nNow, we can calculate e^(-10):\n\ne^(-10) ≈ 0.0000453999\n\nNext, we calculate 10^15:\n\n10^15 = 1,000,000,000,000,000\n\nNow, we can plug in all the values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 15) = (0.0000453999 * 1,000,000,000,000,000) / 1,307,674,368,000\n\nP(X = 15) ≈ 34,657.4 / 1,307,674,368,000\n\nP(X = 15) ≈ 0.0000265\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 15 cars will pass through the intersection during the next hour is approximately 0.00265 or 0.265%."
