    "message_2": "To find the scaling factor needed to double the length of the fractal, we can use the formula:\n\nscaling factor = (new length / original length)^(1 / fractal dimension)\n\nIn this case, we want to double the length of the fractal, so the new length is twice the original length:\n\nscaling factor = (2 * original length / original length)^(1 / 1.97)\n\nThe original length cancels out:\n\nscaling factor = 2^(1 / 1.97)\n\nNow, we can calculate the scaling factor:\n\nscaling factor ≈ 2^(1 / 1.97) ≈ 2^0.507614 ≈ 1.414\n\nSo, the scaling factor needed to double the length of the Vicsek fractal with a dimension of 1.97 is approximately 1.414."
