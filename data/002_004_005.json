    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 14 cm and the width is 8 cm. So, we plug these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2(14 + 8)\nPerimeter = 2(22)\nPerimeter = 44 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 44 cm."
