    "message_2": "To find the most likely shift value, we can use the hint that the most frequently occurring letter in English is \"e\". We will look for the most frequently occurring letter in the encrypted message and assume that it was originally an \"e\".\n\nThe encrypted message is: Lwlvdzhvrphsurjudpplqjlqsbwkrq\n\nThe most frequently occurring letter in the encrypted message is \"l\" (appearing 4 times).\n\nNow, we will find the shift value between \"l\" and \"e\":\n\nIn the alphabet, \"e\" is the 5th letter and \"l\" is the 12th letter.\n\nThe shift value is: 12 - 5 = 7\n\nSo, the most likely shift value used in the Caesar cipher is 7."
