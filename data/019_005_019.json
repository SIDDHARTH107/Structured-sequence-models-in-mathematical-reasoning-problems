    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve related to Epistemic Logic:\n\nThere are three closed doors in front of a group of three people A, B, and C. One of these doors has a prize behind it, while the other two doors are empty. Each person knows that at least one of the doors is empty, but they do not know which door has the prize. Assume that each person is perfectly logical, and that they also know that the other two people are perfectly logical as well. Additionally, each person knows that if they can determine which door has the prize behind it, they will open it and claim the prize. If they cannot determine which door has the prize, they will keep the doors closed and no one will receive the prize.\n\nAfter examining the doors, A says \"I do not know which door has the prize behind it.\" B then says \"I do not know which door has the prize behind it either.\" Finally, C says \"I know which door has the prize behind it.\"\n\nWhat door has the prize behind it, and how did C know which door to choose?",
    "message_2": "Let's label the doors as Door 1, Door 2, and Door 3.\n\nWhen A says \"I do not know which door has the prize behind it,\" it means that A sees at least one empty door. If A saw two empty doors, A would know which door has the prize. Since A doesn't know, it means A sees one empty door and one door with the prize.\n\nNow, B hears A's statement and knows that A sees one empty door and one door with the prize. When B says \"I do not know which door has the prize behind it either,\" it means that B also sees at least one empty door. If B saw two empty doors, B would know which door has the prize. Since B doesn't know, it means B sees one empty door and one door with the prize.\n\nAt this point, C has heard both A and B's statements. C knows that A sees one empty door and one door with the prize, and B sees one empty door and one door with the prize. If C saw two empty doors, then C would be unsure which door has the prize, as both A and B would have seen the prize behind different doors. However, C says \"I know which door has the prize behind it.\" This means that C sees the same empty door as both A and B, and the other door C sees must have the prize behind it.\n\nTherefore, the door with the prize behind it is the door that neither A nor B mentioned as empty, and C was able to deduce this based on their statements."
