    "message_2": "Let's call the smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition x. We can write the given information as:\n\nx ≡ 2 (mod 5)\nx ≡ 3 (mod 7)\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences. First, we find the modular inverses:\n\nLet N1 = 7 and N2 = 5, then N = N1 * N2 = 35.\n\nn1 = N/N1 = 35/7 = 5\nn2 = N/N2 = 35/5 = 7\n\nNow we need to find the modular inverses:\n\nn1 * a1 ≡ 1 (mod N2)\n5 * a1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)\n\nSince 5 is already 0 (mod 5), we can ignore this equation as it will not affect the final result.\n\nn2 * a2 ≡ 1 (mod N1)\n7 * a2 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nTrying values for a2, we find that a2 = 1 satisfies the equation:\n\n7 * 1 ≡ 1 (mod 7)\n\nNow we can find x:\n\nx = (2 * n1 * a1 + 3 * n2 * a2) % N\nx = (2 * 5 * 0 + 3 * 7 * 1) % 35\nx = (0 + 21) % 35\nx = 21\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is x = 21."
