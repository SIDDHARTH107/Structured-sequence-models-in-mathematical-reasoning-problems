The question would be: \n\nWhat is the value of \"c\" on the interval [0,4] for the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3 such that f'(c) is equal to the average rate of change of f(x) on the same interval?",
    "message_2": "To find the value of \"c\" that satisfies the mean value theorem, we first need to find the average rate of change of f(x) on the interval [0,4] and then find the value of \"c\" for which f'(c) is equal to this average rate of change.\n\n1. Find the average rate of change of f(x) on the interval [0,4]:\n\nAverage rate of change = (f(4) - f(0)) / (4 - 0)\n\nf(4) = 4^2 - 2(4) + 3 = 16 - 8 + 3 = 11\nf(0) = 0^2 - 2(0) + 3 = 3\n\nAverage rate of change = (11 - 3) / (4 - 0) = 8 / 4 = 2\n\n2. Find f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 - 2x + 3) = 2x - 2\n\n3. Set f'(c) equal to the average rate of change and solve for c:\n\n2x - 2 = 2\n2x = 4\nx = 2\n\nSo, the value of \"c\" on the interval [0,4] for the function f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3 such that f'(c) is equal to the average rate of change of f(x) on the same interval is c = 2."
