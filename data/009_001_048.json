    "message_2": "To represent the population growth of the bacteria, we can use the exponential growth model, which is a differential equation of the form:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n\nwhere P is the population, t is the time in hours, and k is the growth rate constant.\n\nGiven that the population doubles every hour, we can find the value of k as follows:\n\nP(t) = P(0) * 2^(t/τ)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, P(0) is the initial population, and τ is the doubling time (1 hour in this case).\n\nSo, after 1 hour:\n\n1000 * 2^(1/1) = 1000 * 2^1 = 2000\n\nNow, we can find the value of k:\n\ndP/dt = kP\n2000 - 1000 = k * 1000\nk = 1\n\nNow that we have the value of k, we can write the differential equation:\n\ndP/dt = P\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use separation of variables:\n\ndP/P = dt\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n∫(1/P) dP = ∫ dt\n\nln(P) = t + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration. To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition P(0) = 1000:\n\nln(1000) = 0 + C\nC = ln(1000)\n\nNow we can write the general solution of the differential equation:\n\nln(P) = t + ln(1000)\n\nTo find the population after 5 hours, we can plug in t = 5:\n\nln(P) = 5 + ln(1000)\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n\nP = e^(5 + ln(1000))\nP = e^5 * e^(ln(1000))\nP = e^5 * 1000\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nP ≈ 148413.16\n\nSo, after 5 hours, the population of bacteria will be approximately 148,413."
