    "message_2": "To find the probability that a hurricane will not occur in the next 5 years, we first need to find the probability that a hurricane will not occur in any given year. Since there is a 20% chance of a hurricane happening, there is an 80% chance of a hurricane not happening in any given year (100% - 20% = 80%).\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a hurricane will not occur in all 5 years. To do this, we multiply the probability of a hurricane not occurring in each year together:\n\n0.8 (Year 1) * 0.8 (Year 2) * 0.8 (Year 3) * 0.8 (Year 4) * 0.8 (Year 5)\n\n0.8^5 = 0.32768\n\nSo, there is a 32.768% chance that a hurricane will not occur in the next 5 years."
