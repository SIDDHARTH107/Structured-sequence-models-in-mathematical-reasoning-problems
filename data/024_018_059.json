    "message_2": "To find the sectional curvature of the surface z = x^2 - y^2 at the point (1,1,0) in the direction of the vectors u = (2,1,0) and v = (1,2,0), we first need to find the first and second fundamental forms of the surface.\n\nLet's parametrize the surface as follows:\nS(u, v) = (u, v, u^2 - v^2)\n\nNow, we compute the first fundamental form by finding the tangent vectors and their dot products:\n\nSu = dS/du = (1, 0, 2u)\nSv = dS/dv = (0, 1, -2v)\n\nE = <Su, Su> = 1 + 4u^2\nF = <Su, Sv> = -4uv\nG = <Sv, Sv> = 1 + 4v^2\n\nAt the point (1,1,0), we have:\nE = 5\nF = -4\nG = 5\n\nNow, we compute the second fundamental form by finding the normal vector and taking its dot product with the second derivatives of the surface:\n\nN = Su x Sv = (-2u, 2v, 1)\n\nNow, we normalize the normal vector:\n|N| = sqrt((-2u)^2 + (2v)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1)\n\nNormalized N = (-2u/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), 2v/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1), 1/sqrt(4u^2 + 4v^2 + 1))\n\nAt the point (1,1,0), the normalized normal vector is:\nN = (-1/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))\n\nNow, we compute the second derivatives of the surface:\nSuu = (0, 0, 2)\nSuv = (0, 0, -2)\nSvv = (0, 0, 2)\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients of the second fundamental form:\nL = <N, Suu> = 2/sqrt(6)\nM = <N, Suv> = -2/sqrt(6)\nN = <N, Svv> = 2/sqrt(6)\n\nNow, we compute the sectional curvature K using the first and second fundamental forms:\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nAt the point (1,1,0), we have:\nK = ((2/sqrt(6))*(2/sqrt(6)) - (-2/sqrt(6))^2) / (5*5 - (-4)^2)\nK = (4/6 - 4/6) / (25 - 16)\nK = 0 / 9\nK = 0\n\nSo, the sectional curvature of the surface z = x^2 - y^2 at the point (1,1,0) in the direction of the vectors u = (2,1,0) and v = (1,2,0) is 0."
