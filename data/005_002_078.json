A sample of 50 teachers from the district is taken to estimate the average salary of all teachers in the district. Find the 95% confidence interval for the average salary of all teachers in the district.",
    "message_2": "To find the 95% confidence interval for the average salary of all teachers in the district, we will use the formula for the confidence interval of a sample mean:\n\nCI = x̄ ± (Z * (σ / √n))\n\nwhere:\nCI = confidence interval\nx̄ = sample mean (average salary)\nZ = Z-score (for a 95% confidence interval, Z = 1.96)\nσ = standard deviation\nn = sample size\n\nGiven:\nx̄ = $50,000\nσ = $4,000\nn = 50\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = σ / √n = $4,000 / √50 ≈ $565.69\n\nNow, we can find the margin of error (ME):\n\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * $565.69 ≈ $1,108.75\n\nFinally, we can find the 95% confidence interval:\n\nCI = x̄ ± ME = $50,000 ± $1,108.75\n\nLower limit: $50,000 - $1,108.75 = $48,891.25\nUpper limit: $50,000 + $1,108.75 = $51,108.75\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the average salary of all teachers in the district is approximately $48,891.25 to $51,108.75."
