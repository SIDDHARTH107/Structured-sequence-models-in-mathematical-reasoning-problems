    "message_2": "A Menger sponge is a fractal shape created by iteratively removing cubes from a larger cube. In each iteration, the cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes (3x3x3), and the central cube and the six cubes that share a face with the central cube are removed. This leaves 20 smaller cubes. This process is repeated for each of the remaining smaller cubes.\n\nFor a level 4 Menger sponge, this process is repeated four times. To find the volume of the Menger sponge, we need to calculate the number of smaller cubes remaining after four iterations and multiply it by the volume of each of the smallest cubes.\n\nIn each iteration, the number of cubes increases by a factor of 20 (since 20 smaller cubes are left after removing the 7 cubes). So, after four iterations, the number of cubes is:\n\n20^4 = 160,000\n\nThe edge length of the smallest cubes is the initial edge length (3 cm) divided by 3 raised to the power of the number of iterations (4):\n\n3 cm / (3^4) = 3 cm / 81 = 1/27 cm\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of one of the smallest cubes:\n\nVolume = (1/27 cm)^3 = 1/19683 cm³\n\nFinally, we can find the total volume of the level 4 Menger sponge by multiplying the number of smallest cubes by the volume of each cube:\n\nVolume = 160,000 * (1/19683) cm³ ≈ 8.128 cm³\n\nSo, the volume of a level 4 Menger sponge with an initial edge length of 3 cm is approximately 8.128 cm³."
