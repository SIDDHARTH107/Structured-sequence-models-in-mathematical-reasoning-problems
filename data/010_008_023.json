    "message_2": "To maximize the number of (d-1)-dimensional simplices, we should consider the case where each d-dimensional simplex shares the most (d-1)-dimensional faces with other d-dimensional simplices. In this case, each d-dimensional simplex has (d+1) faces of dimension (d-1).\n\nLet m be the maximum number of (d-1)-dimensional simplices in X. Then, we can write the following inequality:\n\nm â‰¥ k(d+1)/2\n\nThe inequality comes from the fact that, on average, each (d-1)-dimensional face is shared by at most 2 d-dimensional simplices. The division by 2 is to avoid double counting the (d-1)-dimensional faces.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of m that satisfies this inequality. Note that the inequality is not tight, and the actual maximum value of m might be smaller than the value obtained from the inequality. However, this inequality gives us an upper bound on the maximum number of (d-1)-dimensional simplices.\n\nTo find the maximum value of m, we can use the fact that the total number of (d-1)-dimensional simplices in a complete simplicial complex with n vertices is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(n, d) = n! / [d!(n-d)!]\n\nSince we want to maximize m, we should choose the largest possible value of n, which is n = d+k. In this case, the maximum number of (d-1)-dimensional simplices is given by:\n\nm_max = C(d+k, d) = (d+k)! / [d!(k)!]\n\nIn summary, the maximum number of (d-1)-dimensional simplices that X can have is given by:\n\nm_max = (d+k)! / [d!(k)!]\n\nThis value is an upper bound, and the actual maximum number of (d-1)-dimensional simplices might be smaller, depending on the specific structure of the simplicial complex X."
