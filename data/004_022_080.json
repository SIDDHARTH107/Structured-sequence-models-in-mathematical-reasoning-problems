    "message_2": "Let r be the radius of the base of the cylindrical can and h be its height. The volume of the cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, and we are given that V = 400 cubic inches.\n\nThe cost of the material for the sides of the can is $0.02 per square inch, and the surface area of the sides is given by the formula A_sides = 2πrh. Therefore, the cost of the sides is C_sides = 0.02 * 2πrh.\n\nThe cost of the material for the top and bottom of the can is $0.05 per square inch, and the surface area of the top and bottom is given by the formula A_top_bottom = 2πr^2. Therefore, the cost of the top and bottom is C_top_bottom = 0.05 * 2πr^2.\n\nThe total cost of the can is the sum of the costs of the sides, top, and bottom: C_total = C_sides + C_top_bottom = 0.02 * 2πrh + 0.05 * 2πr^2.\n\nWe want to minimize C_total with respect to r and h. To do this, we can use the constraint given by the volume formula: 400 = πr^2h. Solving for h, we get h = 400/(πr^2).\n\nNow, substitute this expression for h into the total cost formula:\n\nC_total = 0.02 * 2πr(400/(πr^2)) + 0.05 * 2πr^2\nC_total = (0.04 * 400)/r + 0.1πr^2\n\nNow we can find the minimum cost by taking the derivative of C_total with respect to r and setting it equal to 0:\n\nd(C_total)/dr = -0.04 * 400/r^2 + 0.2πr = 0\n\nMultiplying through by r^2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n-0.04 * 400 + 0.2πr^3 = 0\n\nNow, solve for r:\n\n0.2πr^3 = 0.04 * 400\nr^3 = (0.04 * 400) / (0.2π)\nr^3 ≈ 25.46\nr ≈ 2.93 inches\n\nNow, we can find the height h using the volume formula:\n\nh = 400/(π(2.93)^2)\nh ≈ 5.86 inches\n\nSo, the dimensions of the cheapest can they can produce are approximately r = 2.93 inches and h = 5.86 inches."
