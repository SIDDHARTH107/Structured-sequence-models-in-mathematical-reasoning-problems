    "message_2": "In the Sierpinski carpet, the number of black squares doubles with each iteration. Given that the 1st iteration has 1 black square, we can find the total number of black squares in the 4th iteration as follows:\n\n1st iteration: 1 black square\n2nd iteration: 1 * 2 = 2 black squares\n3rd iteration: 2 * 2 = 4 black squares\n4th iteration: 4 * 2 = 8 black squares\n\nSo, the 4th iteration of the Sierpinski carpet has 8 black squares."
