    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but it's not possible to write a precise numerical problem for the topic of paraconsistent logic in mathematics as it is not directly related to numerical calculations. Paraconsistent logic is a type of logic that allows contradictions to coexist without leading to a logical breakdown. It deals with the analysis of reasoning where some form of inconsistency is allowed. Therefore, the questions related to paraconsistent logic would involve more conceptual thinking and understanding of logic rather than numerical calculations.",
    "message_2": "I understand that you are emphasizing the non-numerical nature of paraconsistent logic. As a mathematician, I can still provide some insight into the topic, even if it doesn't involve numerical calculations.\n\nParaconsistent logic is an alternative approach to classical logic, which aims to address the issue of contradictions. In classical logic, if a contradiction is found, the entire system is considered invalid. However, paraconsistent logic allows for contradictions to coexist without causing the entire system to collapse.\n\nThis type of logic is particularly useful in situations where inconsistencies are unavoidable or when dealing with incomplete or uncertain information. It has applications in various fields, including artificial intelligence, philosophy, and computer science.\n\nIf you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of paraconsistent logic or its applications, please feel free to ask."
