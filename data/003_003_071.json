    "message_2": "To find the exact value of sin(45°) using the unit circle, we first need to convert the angle from degrees to radians. \n\n45° * (π/180) = π/4\n\nNow, we can use the unit circle to find the coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the angle π/4 intersects the circle. Since π/4 is halfway between 0 and π/2, the coordinates of the point will be equal in both the x and y directions.\n\nIn a 45-45-90 right triangle, the ratio of the sides is 1:1:√2. So, if the hypotenuse (the radius of the unit circle) is 1, then the legs (the x and y coordinates) will be:\n\nx = 1/√2\ny = 1/√2\n\nSince sin(θ) is the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle, sin(45°) or sin(π/4) is:\n\nsin(π/4) = 1/√2\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by √2:\n\nsin(π/4) = (1/√2) * (√2/√2) = √2/2\n\nSo, the exact value of sin(45°) is √2/2."
