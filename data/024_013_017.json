    "message_2": "To find the volume form of the given metric, we first need to compute the determinant of the metric tensor g_ij. The metric tensor for the given metric is:\n\ng_ij = | 1   0         0       |\n           | 0   1         0       |\n           | 0   0   (4z^2 + 1) |\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of g_ij:\n\ndet(g_ij) = 1 * (1 * (4z^2 + 1) - 0) - 0 + 0\ndet(g_ij) = 4z^2 + 1\n\nThe volume form is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times the standard volume element in 3-dimensional space, which is dV = dx ∧ dy ∧ dz. Therefore, the volume form is:\n\n√(det(g_ij)) dV = √(4z^2 + 1) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nNow, we need to find the volume form at the point (1,1,1). We substitute z = 1 into the volume form:\n\n√(4(1)^2 + 1) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz = √(4 + 1) dx ∧ dy ∧ dz = √5 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz\n\nSo, the volume form of the given metric at the point (1,1,1) is:\n\n√5 dx ∧ dy ∧ dz"
