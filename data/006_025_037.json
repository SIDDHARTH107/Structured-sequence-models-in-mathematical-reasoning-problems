    "message_1": "During a magic show, a magician performs a card trick with a deck of 52 cards. In the trick, the magician asks a volunteer to choose a card from the deck randomly. What is the probability that the volunteer chooses a diamond card? Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
    "message_2": "There are 13 diamond cards in a standard deck of 52 cards. To find the probability of choosing a diamond card, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nIn this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 13 (the number of diamond cards), and the total number of possible outcomes is 52 (the total number of cards in the deck).\n\nProbability = 13/52\n\nTo round the answer to the nearest hundredth, we can simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal:\n\nProbability â‰ˆ 0.25\n\nSo, the probability of choosing a diamond card is approximately 0.25 or 25%."
