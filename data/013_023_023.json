    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem for a math student on Trust Games:\n\nSuppose two players, Alice and Bob, are each given $10 to begin with. Alice can choose to keep the entire amount, or send a fraction of it (say, x) to Bob. Upon receipt of the transferred fraction, Bob can then keep the entire received amount or send back a fraction of it (say, y) to Alice. If Bob chooses to send some amount back, he can choose to send less or more than what he received. If Alice and Bob both decide to keep their amounts, they each keep the initial $10 they were given. If either of them sends some amount to the other, then the transferred amount is multiplied by a predetermined factor (e.g., 2), and sent back. If the transferred amount is $5 and the multiplier is 2, then the receiver gets $10 and the sender gets $5.\n\nAssuming that both Alice and Bob are rational and self-interested, and that the multiplier is 2, what is the optimal amount x that Alice should send to Bob, and what is the optimal amount y that Bob should send back to Alice?",
    "message_2": "Let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. If Alice sends x dollars to Bob, she will have (10 - x) dollars left.\n2. The amount sent to Bob is multiplied by 2, so Bob receives 2x dollars. Now, Bob has (10 + 2x) dollars.\n3. Bob can send back y dollars to Alice, where y is a fraction of the amount he received (2x). So, y = k * 2x, where 0 ≤ k ≤ 1.\n4. After sending y dollars back, Bob will have (10 + 2x - y) dollars left.\n\nNow, both Alice and Bob are rational and self-interested, so they will try to maximize their own gains. \n\nFor Alice, her final amount will be (10 - x + y). To maximize this, she should maximize y. Since y = k * 2x, the maximum value of y is when k = 1, which means y = 2x. In this case, Alice's final amount will be (10 - x + 2x) = (10 + x).\n\nFor Bob, his final amount will be (10 + 2x - y). To maximize this, he should minimize y. The minimum value of y is when k = 0, which means y = 0. In this case, Bob's final amount will be (10 + 2x).\n\nHowever, if Alice anticipates that Bob will not send anything back (y = 0), she will not send any amount to Bob in the first place (x = 0). In this case, both Alice and Bob will keep their initial $10.\n\nSo, the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, given their rational and self-interested nature, is not to send any amount to each other. Therefore, x = 0 and y = 0."
