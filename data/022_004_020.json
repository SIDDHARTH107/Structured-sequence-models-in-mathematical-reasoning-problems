    "message_2": "To find the singularities of the function f(z) = (z^2 + 9)/(z^2 - 1), we first need to find the points where the denominator is zero. \n\nThe denominator is z^2 - 1, so we set it equal to zero:\n\nz^2 - 1 = 0\n\nThis factors as (z - 1)(z + 1) = 0, so the singularities are at z = 1 and z = -1.\n\nNow we need to classify each singularity as removable, pole, or essential. \n\nA singularity is removable if the function can be redefined at the singularity to make it continuous. A singularity is a pole if the function goes to infinity at the singularity. A singularity is essential if it is neither removable nor a pole.\n\nFor z = 1:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 9)/(z^2 - 1) = (z^2 + 9)/((z - 1)(z + 1))\n\nAs z approaches 1, the numerator does not go to zero, but the denominator does. This means that the function goes to infinity at z = 1, so this is a pole.\n\nFor z = -1:\n\nf(z) = (z^2 + 9)/(z^2 - 1) = (z^2 + 9)/((z - 1)(z + 1))\n\nAs z approaches -1, the numerator does not go to zero, but the denominator does. This means that the function goes to infinity at z = -1, so this is also a pole.\n\nIn conclusion, the function f(z) = (z^2 + 9)/(z^2 - 1) has two singularities at z = 1 and z = -1, both of which are poles."
