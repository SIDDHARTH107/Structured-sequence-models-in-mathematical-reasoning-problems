    "message_2": "The scaling factor of the Barnsley fern can be found by dividing the length of the largest fronds by the length of the first stem. In this case, the largest fronds are 1/3 unit in length, and the first stem is 1 unit in length.\n\nScaling factor = (Length of largest fronds) / (Length of first stem)\nScaling factor = (1/3) / 1\nScaling factor = 1/3\n\nSo, the scaling factor of the Barnsley fern in this case is 1/3."
