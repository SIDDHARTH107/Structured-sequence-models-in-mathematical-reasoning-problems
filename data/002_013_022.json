    "message_1": "A rectangular pyramid has a base area of 36 square meters and a height of 8 meters. Find the volume of the pyramid.",
    "message_2": "To find the volume of a rectangular pyramid, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height\n\nGiven the base area is 36 square meters and the height is 8 meters, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nVolume = (1/3) * 36 * 8\n\nVolume = 12 * 8\n\nVolume = 96 cubic meters\n\nSo, the volume of the rectangular pyramid is 96 cubic meters."
