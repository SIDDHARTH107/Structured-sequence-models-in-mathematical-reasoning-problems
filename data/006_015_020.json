    "message_1": "A certain type of cyber attack occurs on a network with a probability of 0.3. If the network is expected to experience 10 attacks in a month, what is the probability that more than 6 of these attacks are of the certain type?",
    "message_2": "We can use the binomial probability formula to solve this problem. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k successes (in this case, the certain type of cyber attack) in n trials (total number of attacks)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (the certain type of cyber attack occurring)\n- n is the total number of trials (total number of attacks)\n- k is the number of successes (the certain type of cyber attack)\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\n- p = 0.3 (probability of the certain type of cyber attack)\n- n = 10 (total number of attacks in a month)\n\nWe want to find the probability that more than 6 of these attacks are of the certain type, which means we need to find the probability of 7, 8, 9, or 10 of the attacks being of the certain type. We can calculate this by summing the probabilities for each of these cases:\n\nP(X > 6) = P(X = 7) + P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10)\n\nWe can use the binomial probability formula to calculate each of these probabilities:\n\nP(X = 7) = C(10, 7) * 0.3^7 * (1-0.3)^(10-7)\nP(X = 8) = C(10, 8) * 0.3^8 * (1-0.3)^(10-8)\nP(X = 9) = C(10, 9) * 0.3^9 * (1-0.3)^(10-9)\nP(X = 10) = C(10, 10) * 0.3^10 * (1-0.3)^(10-10)\n\nCalculating each probability:\n\nP(X = 7) = 120 * 0.3^7 * 0.7^3 ≈ 0.2668\nP(X = 8) = 45 * 0.3^8 * 0.7^2 ≈ 0.0573\nP(X = 9) = 10 * 0.3^9 * 0.7^1 ≈ 0.0054\nP(X = 10) = 1 * 0.3^10 * 0.7^0 ≈ 0.00006\n\nNow, we can sum these probabilities:\n\nP(X > 6) = 0.2668 + 0.0573 + 0.0054 + 0.00006 ≈ 0.3296\n\nSo, the probability that more than 6 of the 10 attacks are of the certain type is approximately 0.3296 or 32.96%."
