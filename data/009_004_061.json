    "message_2": "To find the equation of motion for this mass-spring system, we can use the following formula:\n\nx(t) = A * cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere x(t) is the displacement of the mass at time t, A is the amplitude of oscillation, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nGiven the initial conditions, we have:\n\nx(0) = A * cos(φ) = 0.5 m\nv(0) = -A * ω * sin(φ) = 0 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the angular frequency ω. We can use the formula:\n\nω = sqrt(k/m)\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and m is the mass. Plugging in the given values:\n\nω = sqrt(8 N/m / 2 kg) = sqrt(4) = 2 rad/s\n\nNow, we can find the phase angle φ. Since x(0) = 0.5 m, we have:\n\n0.5 = A * cos(φ)\n\nSince the initial velocity is 0 m/s, we have:\n\n0 = -A * 2 * sin(φ)\n\nFrom the second equation, we can conclude that sin(φ) = 0, which means φ = 0 or φ = π. Since x(0) = 0.5 m, we can conclude that φ = 0. Therefore, A = 0.5 m.\n\nSo, the equation of motion for this system is:\n\nx(t) = 0.5 * cos(2t)\n\nNow, to find the period of oscillation, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 2π / ω\n\nPlugging in the value of ω:\n\nT = 2π / 2 = π seconds\n\nSo, the period of oscillation for this mass-spring system is π seconds."
