    "message_2": "First, we need to convert the decimal numbers 45 and 68 to binary.\n\n45 in binary is 101101\n68 in binary is 1000100\n\nTo make the binary numbers have the same number of digits, we can add a leading 0 to the binary representation of 45:\n\n045 in binary is 0101101\n\nNow, we can add the two binary numbers using modulo 2 arithmetic:\n\n  0101101 (45)\n+ 1000100 (68)\n----------\n  1101001 (encrypted binary message)\n\nSo, the resulting encrypted binary message is 1101001."
