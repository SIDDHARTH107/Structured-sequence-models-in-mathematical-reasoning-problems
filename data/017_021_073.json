    "message_2": "To determine the number of distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 48, we can use the fact that the order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3^1, so we need to consider the Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nLet n_p denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups in G. By Sylow's Theorems, we have the following conditions:\n\n1. n_2 divides 3 (the index of the Sylow 2-subgroup), and n_2 is congruent to 1 mod 2.\n2. n_3 divides 16 (the index of the Sylow 3-subgroup), and n_3 is congruent to 1 mod 3.\n\nFor n_2, the possible values are 1 and 3. For n_3, the possible values are 1 and 4.\n\nNow, we consider the possible structures of the Sylow subgroups and their combinations:\n\n1. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. In this case, G is isomorphic to the direct product of these subgroups, which is the cyclic group of order 48, C_48.\n\n2. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup. The Sylow 2-subgroups can have orders 8 or 16. If the order is 8, then there are two possibilities for the structure of the Sylow 2-subgroup: C_8 or C_4 × C_2. This leads to two non-isomorphic groups: G ≅ (C_8 × C_3) ⋊ C_3 and G ≅ (C_4 × C_2 × C_3) ⋊ C_3. If the order is 16, then there is only one possibility for the structure of the Sylow 2-subgroup: C_16. This leads to one non-isomorphic group: G ≅ (C_16 × C_3) ⋊ C_3.\n\n3. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4, then G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup and four Sylow 3-subgroups. In this case, G is isomorphic to the semidirect product of the Sylow 2-subgroup and the Sylow 3-subgroup, which is the group G ≅ C_8 ⋊ C_3.\n\n4. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4, then G has three Sylow 2-subgroups and four Sylow 3-subgroups. This case does not lead to any non-isomorphic groups since the conditions on n_2 and n_3 are not compatible.\n\nIn total, we have found 5 distinct non-isomorphic groups of order 48:\n\n1. C_48\n2. (C_8 × C_3) ⋊ C_3\n3. (C_4 × C_2 × C_3) ⋊ C_3\n4. (C_16 × C_3) ⋊ C_3\n5. C_8 ⋊ C_3\n\nWithout more information about the specific group G, we cannot determine which of these groups G is isomorphic to."
