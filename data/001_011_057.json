    "message_2": "To solve the equation (4/x) + (1/(x-3)) = (5/(x^2 - 3x)), we will first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator is x(x-3). \n\nNow, we will rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n(4/x) * ((x-3)/(x-3)) + (1/(x-3)) * (x/x) = (5/(x^2 - 3x))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(4(x-3) + x(x-3))/(x(x-3)) = 5/(x^2 - 3x)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n(4x - 12 + x^2 - 3x)/(x(x-3)) = 5/(x^2 - 3x)\n\nSince the denominators are the same, we can equate the numerators:\n\n4x - 12 + x^2 - 3x = 5\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 + x - 12 - 5 = 0\n\nx^2 + x - 17 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation. We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -17. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(1) ± √((1)^2 - 4(1)(-17))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1 + 68)) / 2\n\nx = (-1 ± √69) / 2\n\nSo, the solutions for x are:\n\nx = (-1 + √69) / 2 and x = (-1 - √69) / 2"
