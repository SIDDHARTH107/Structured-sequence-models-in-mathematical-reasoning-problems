    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a question for a math student to solve related to optimal resource allocation:\n\nA company produces two products - Product A and Product B. The company has a budget of $10,000 to allocate towards the production of these products. Product A requires a production cost of $20 per unit and can be sold for $50 per unit. Product B requires a production cost of $30 per unit and can be sold for $70 per unit. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize their profit?",
    "message_2": "To maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal number of units of Product A and Product B to produce within the given budget constraint. Let x be the number of units of Product A and y be the number of units of Product B.\n\nThe budget constraint is given by:\n20x + 30y ≤ 10,000\n\nThe profit function is given by:\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nProfit = (50x + 70y) - (20x + 30y)\nProfit = 30x + 40y\n\nTo maximize the profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the budget constraint. We can rewrite the budget constraint as:\ny ≤ (10,000 - 20x) / 30\n\nSince x and y must be non-negative integers (we can't produce a negative or fractional number of units), we can use integer linear programming to solve this problem. However, we can also solve it graphically by plotting the feasible region and finding the corner points.\n\nThe feasible region is given by the inequality y ≤ (10,000 - 20x) / 30. The corner points are the points where the budget constraint intersects the axes and where the slope of the profit function is equal to the slope of the budget constraint.\n\n1. Intersection with the x-axis (y = 0):\n20x + 30(0) ≤ 10,000\nx ≤ 500\n\n2. Intersection with the y-axis (x = 0):\n20(0) + 30y ≤ 10,000\ny ≤ 333.33 (rounded down to 333 since y must be an integer)\n\n3. The slope of the profit function is 30/40 = 3/4. The slope of the budget constraint is -20/30 = -2/3. Since the slopes are not equal, there is no corner point where the slopes are equal.\n\nNow we need to evaluate the profit function at the corner points (0, 333) and (500, 0):\n\nProfit at (0, 333) = 30(0) + 40(333) = 13,320\nProfit at (500, 0) = 30(500) + 40(0) = 15,000\n\nThe maximum profit is $15,000, which occurs when the company produces 500 units of Product A and 0 units of Product B."
