However, I can provide a sample question related to Deontic logic for a math student to solve:\n\nSuppose there are seven students who need to take turns using a computer at the library, and each student has to use it for a minimum of 30 minutes. If the library opens at 10:00 AM and closes at 6:00 PM, what is the minimum time each student can spend on the computer? \n\nNote: Deontic logic deals with the logic of obligation, permission, and requirements, and the question above can be considered as a practical application of deontic logic in a typical scenario.",
    "message_2": "The library is open for a total of 8 hours (from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM). To find the total number of minutes the library is open, we can convert the 8 hours to minutes:\n\n8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes\n\nNow, we know that there are seven students who need to use the computer, and each student has to use it for a minimum of 30 minutes. Therefore, the total minimum time required for all seven students to use the computer is:\n\n7 students * 30 minutes/student = 210 minutes\n\nSince the library is open for 480 minutes and the total minimum time required for all seven students to use the computer is 210 minutes, there is enough time for each student to use the computer for at least 30 minutes. Therefore, the minimum time each student can spend on the computer is 30 minutes."
