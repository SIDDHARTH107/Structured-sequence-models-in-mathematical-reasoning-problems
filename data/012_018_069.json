    "message_2": "To find the edge connectivity of a graph G, we can use the formula λ(G) = min{d(u) + d(v) - 2}, where λ(G) is the edge connectivity, and d(u) and d(v) are the degrees of two non-adjacent vertices u and v in G.\n\nSince G has 8 vertices and 12 edges, the average degree of the vertices is (2 * 12) / 8 = 3. This means that there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or less.\n\nLet's consider a vertex u with a degree of 3. Since u is not adjacent to all other vertices, there must be at least one vertex v that is not adjacent to u. The minimum degree of v is 1, as it must be connected to at least one other vertex.\n\nNow, we can apply the formula for edge connectivity:\n\nλ(G) = min{d(u) + d(v) - 2} = min{3 + 1 - 2} = min{2} = 2\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of edges whose removal will disconnect the graph G is 2."
