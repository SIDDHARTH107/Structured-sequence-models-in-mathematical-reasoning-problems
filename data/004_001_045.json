    "message_2": "To find the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^2 - 3x + 7, we will use the power rule for differentiation. The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to each term in the function:\n\nf'(x) = d(5x^2)/dx - d(3x)/dx + d(7)/dx\n\nf'(x) = 5 * 2 * x^(2-1) - 3 * 1 * x^(1-1) + 0\nf'(x) = 10x - 3\n\nNow, we will find the derivative at the point x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = 10(2) - 3\nf'(2) = 20 - 3\nf'(2) = 17\n\nSo, the derivative of the function f(x) = 5x^2 - 3x + 7 at the point x = 2 is 17."
