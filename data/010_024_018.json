    "message_1": "A hyperbolic surface has been tiled by regular heptagons, each of which has a side length of 2 in hyperbolic units. Find the total area of the hyperbolic surface.",
    "message_2": "To find the total area of the hyperbolic surface, we first need to determine the area of a single regular heptagon in hyperbolic space. In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a polygon can be found using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which states that the area of a polygon is given by:\n\nArea = (n - 2)π - Σα\n\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon, α is the interior angle of each vertex, and Σα is the sum of the interior angles of the polygon.\n\nFor a regular heptagon, n = 7, and the interior angle α can be calculated as:\n\nα = (n - 2)π / n = (7 - 2)π / 7 = 5π / 7\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of the heptagon is:\n\nΣα = 7 * (5π / 7) = 5π\n\nNow we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the area of a single heptagon:\n\nArea = (7 - 2)π - 5π = 5π - 5π = 0\n\nHowever, this result is not correct, as the area of a polygon cannot be zero. The issue here is that the Gauss-Bonnet theorem is applicable to polygons in Euclidean geometry, not hyperbolic geometry. In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a polygon is given by:\n\nArea = (n - 2)π - Σθ\n\nwhere θ is the angle defect at each vertex. The angle defect is the difference between the interior angle in Euclidean geometry and the interior angle in hyperbolic geometry. For a regular heptagon, the angle defect at each vertex is:\n\nθ = (2π / 7) - (5π / 7) = -3π / 7\n\nNow we can use the hyperbolic Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the area of a single heptagon:\n\nArea = (7 - 2)π - 7 * (-3π / 7) = 5π + 3π = 8π\n\nNow, we need to know how many heptagons are there in the hyperbolic surface to find the total area. However, the problem does not provide this information. If we assume there are N heptagons, then the total area of the hyperbolic surface can be calculated as:\n\nTotal Area = N * 8π\n\nWithout knowing the number of heptagons, we cannot find the exact total area of the hyperbolic surface."
