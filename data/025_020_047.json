    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent plane to X at the point (1 : -1 : 0), we first need to compute the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to x, y, and z. \n\nThe equation of the Calabi-Yau variety X is given by F(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0.\n\nNow, let's compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂F/∂x = 3x^2\n∂F/∂y = 3y^2\n∂F/∂z = 3z^2\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these partial derivatives at the point (1 : -1 : 0):\n\n∂F/∂x(1, -1, 0) = 3(1)^2 = 3\n∂F/∂y(1, -1, 0) = 3(-1)^2 = 3\n∂F/∂z(1, -1, 0) = 3(0)^2 = 0\n\nThe gradient of F at the point (1 : -1 : 0) is given by the vector (3, 3, 0).\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the tangent plane using the point-slope form:\n\nF(x, y, z) - F(1, -1, 0) = ∂F/∂x(1, -1, 0) * (x - 1) + ∂F/∂y(1, -1, 0) * (y + 1) + ∂F/∂z(1, -1, 0) * (z - 0)\n\n0 - 0 = 3(x - 1) + 3(y + 1) + 0(z - 0)\n\n3x - 3 + 3y + 3 = 0\n\n3x + 3y = 0\n\nThus, the equation of the tangent plane to X at the point (1 : -1 : 0) is x + y = 0."
