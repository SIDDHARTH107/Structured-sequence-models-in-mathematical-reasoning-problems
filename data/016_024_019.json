    "message_2": "The Sierpinski carpet is a fractal pattern that is formed by recursively removing squares from an initial larger square. In each iteration, the remaining squares are divided into 9 smaller squares, and the central square is removed. \n\nLet's denote the total number of squares removed after n iterations as S(n). \n\nInitially, there is one square (the central square) removed after the first iteration, so S(1) = 1.\n\nIn the second iteration, there are 8 smaller squares left from the first iteration, and we remove the central square from each of them. So, in this iteration, we remove 8 squares, and the total number of squares removed after the second iteration is S(2) = S(1) + 8 = 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nIn general, for the nth iteration, there are 8^(n-1) smaller squares left from the previous iteration, and we remove the central square from each of them. So, the number of squares removed in the nth iteration is 8^(n-1).\n\nTherefore, the total number of squares removed after n iterations is given by the sum of squares removed in each iteration:\n\nS(n) = 1 + 8 + 8^2 + ... + 8^(n-1)\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term a = 1, the common ratio r = 8, and n terms. The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula:\n\nS(n) = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nPlugging in the values for a and r, we get:\n\nS(n) = 1 * (1 - 8^n) / (1 - 8)\n\nS(n) = (1 - 8^n) / (-7)\n\nSo, the total number of squares present in the Sierpinski carpet after n iterations is given by the formula:\n\nS(n) = (1 - 8^n) / (-7)"
