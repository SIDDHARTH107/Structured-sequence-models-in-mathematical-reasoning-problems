    "message_2": "To analyze and graph the polynomial function f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 1, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the x-intercepts:\nTo find the x-intercepts, set f(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0\nThis cubic equation does not have a straightforward algebraic solution. However, we can approximate the x-intercepts using numerical methods such as the Rational Root Theorem, synthetic division, or a graphing calculator. The approximate x-intercepts are:\nx ≈ 0.347, x ≈ 1.404, and x ≈ 2.249\n\n2. Find the y-intercept:\nTo find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for f(x):\nf(0) = 2(0)^3 - 5(0)^2 + 3(0) - 1 = -1\nSo, the y-intercept is (0, -1).\n\n3. Find the local extrema (if any):\nTo find the local extrema, we need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative of f(x) and setting it equal to 0:\nf'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x + 3\n6x^2 - 10x + 3 = 0\nThis quadratic equation can be solved using the quadratic formula:\nx = (10 ± √(10^2 - 4(6)(3))) / (2(6))\nx ≈ 0.5 and x ≈ 1\nNow, we need to determine if these critical points are local maxima, local minima, or neither. We can do this by analyzing the second derivative:\nf''(x) = 12x - 10\nf''(0.5) = -1 (since this is negative, we have a local maximum at x ≈ 0.5)\nf''(1) = 2 (since this is positive, we have a local minimum at x ≈ 1)\n\n4. Intervals of increase and decrease:\nSince we have a local maximum at x ≈ 0.5 and a local minimum at x ≈ 1, we can determine the intervals of increase and decrease:\n- f(x) is decreasing on the interval (-∞, 0.5)\n- f(x) is increasing on the interval (0.5, 1)\n- f(x) is decreasing on the interval (1, +∞)\n\n5. End behavior:\nAs x approaches -∞, the leading term (2x^3) dominates the polynomial, and since it is positive, f(x) approaches -∞.\nAs x approaches +∞, the leading term (2x^3) dominates the polynomial, and since it is positive, f(x) approaches +∞.\n\nIn summary:\n- x-intercepts: x ≈ 0.347, x ≈ 1.404, and x ≈ 2.249\n- y-intercept: (0, -1)\n- Local maximum at x ≈ 0.5\n- Local minimum at x ≈ 1\n- Intervals of increase: (0.5, 1)\n- Intervals of decrease: (-∞, 0.5) and (1, +∞)\n- End behavior: f(x) → -∞ as x → -∞ and f(x) → +∞ as x → +∞"
