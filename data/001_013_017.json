    "message_2": "To solve the equation √(x+7) - √(x-3) = 2, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Isolate one of the square roots.\nAdd √(x-3) to both sides of the equation:\n\n√(x+7) = √(x-3) + 2\n\nStep 2: Square both sides of the equation.\n(√(x+7))^2 = (√(x-3) + 2)^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx + 7 = (x-3) + 4√(x-3) + 4\n\nStep 3: Simplify and isolate the remaining square root.\nSubtract x and 7 from both sides:\n\n0 = -10 + 4√(x-3)\n\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n\n10 = 4√(x-3)\n\nStep 4: Solve for x.\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n10/4 = √(x-3)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(10/4)^2 = (x-3)\n\n100/16 = x - 3\n\nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\nx = 100/16 + 3\n\nx = 148/16\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nx = 37/4\n\nSo the solution is x = 37/4."
