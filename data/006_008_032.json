    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of having exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in a week)\n- nCk is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (rainy day) on a single trial (30% or 0.3)\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (non-rainy day) on a single trial (70% or 0.7)\n- n is the number of trials (7 days in a week)\n- k is the number of successes (2 rainy days)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = (7C2) * (0.3^2) * (0.7^5)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 7C2:\n\n7C2 = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 7! / (2!5!) = (7*6) / (2*1) = 21\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n(0.3^2) = 0.09\n(0.7^5) = 0.16807\n\nFinally, let's put it all together:\n\nP(X = 2) = 21 * 0.09 * 0.16807 â‰ˆ 0.319\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 2 rainy days in a week with a 30% chance of rain on any given day is approximately 31.9%."
