    "message_2": "To solve the given system of linear equations using matrix methods, we will use the following steps:\n\n1. Write the augmented matrix for the system.\n2. Perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n3. Perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nStep 1: Write the augmented matrix for the system.\n\nThe given system of linear equations is:\n\nx + 2y + 3z = 9\n2x + 3y + 4z = 16\n3x + 4y + 5z = 22\n\nThe augmented matrix for this system is:\n\n| 1  2  3 | 9 |\n| 2  3  4 | 16|\n| 3  4  5 | 22|\n\nStep 2: Perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form.\n\nFirst, we will eliminate the x terms in the second and third rows.\n\nR2 = R2 - 2 * R1\nR3 = R3 - 3 * R1\n\n| 1  2  3 | 9  |\n| 0 -1 -2 | -2 |\n| 0 -2 -4 | -5 |\n\nNext, we will eliminate the y terms in the third row.\n\nR3 = R3 - 2 * R2\n\n| 1  2  3 | 9  |\n| 0 -1 -2 | -2 |\n| 0  0  0 | 1  |\n\nStep 3: Perform back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nWe can see that the third row of the matrix represents the equation 0x + 0y + 0z = 1, which is a contradiction. This means that the given system of linear equations has no solution."
