    "message_1": "Here's a numerical problem related to Bezout's theorem for you to solve:\n\nGiven two polynomial equations in two variables, f(x,y) = x^3 + 2x^2y + 3xy^2 + 4y^3 - 6x^2 - 4xy - 7y^2 + 12x - 8y + 16 = 0 and g(x,y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 - 12x + 6y - 16 = 0. Use Bezout's theorem to find the number of solutions to these equations in the complex projective plane.",
    "message_2": "Bezout's theorem states that the number of intersection points of two curves in the complex projective plane is equal to the product of their degrees, assuming that the curves have no common components.\n\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest power of any term in the polynomial. In the given polynomials, f(x,y) is a cubic polynomial (degree 3) and g(x,y) is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2).\n\nUsing Bezout's theorem, the number of solutions to these equations in the complex projective plane is the product of their degrees:\n\nNumber of solutions = degree of f(x,y) * degree of g(x,y) = 3 * 2 = 6\n\nSo, there are 6 solutions to these equations in the complex projective plane."
