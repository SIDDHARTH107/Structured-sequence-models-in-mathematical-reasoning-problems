    "message_2": "To find the number of non-abelian groups of order 96, we first analyze the prime factorization of 96, which is 2^5 * 3. We will use the Sylow theorems to determine the possible Sylow subgroups and their properties.\n\nLet G be a group of order 96. By Sylow's first theorem, there exists a Sylow 2-subgroup P of order 2^5 = 32 and a Sylow 3-subgroup Q of order 3. By Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, divides 3 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, divides 32 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1, 4, or 16.\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P and a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q. Both P and Q are normal in G, and G is the direct product of P and Q. Since P and Q are abelian, G is abelian, which is not what we want.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup Q, which is normal in G. The group G acts on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to S_3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the normalizer of a Sylow 2-subgroup, which has index 3 in G. Thus, the image of the homomorphism is a subgroup of S_3 of order 32. However, the largest order of a subgroup of S_3 is 6, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4 or 16\nIn this case, there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup P, which is normal in G. The group G acts on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to S_4 or S_{16}. The kernel of this homomorphism is the normalizer of a Sylow 3-subgroup, which has index 4 or 16 in G. Thus, the image of the homomorphism is a subgroup of S_4 or S_{16} of order 24 or 6. In either case, the image is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_3 or the alternating group A_4. The preimage of A_4 in G is a non-abelian group of order 96, which we denote by G_1.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 4 or 16\nIn this case, there are multiple Sylow 2-subgroups and multiple Sylow 3-subgroups. The group G acts on the set of Sylow 2-subgroups by conjugation, and this action induces a homomorphism from G to S_3. The kernel of this homomorphism is the normalizer of a Sylow 2-subgroup, which has index 3 in G. Thus, the image of the homomorphism is a subgroup of S_3 of order 32. However, the largest order of a subgroup of S_3 is 6, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we conclude that there is only one non-abelian group of order 96, which is G_1. The defining property of G_1 is that it has a normal Sylow 2-subgroup and its action on the set of Sylow 3-subgroups by conjugation induces a homomorphism with image isomorphic to A_4.\n\nNow, let's prove that every group of order 96 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C96, the alternating group A4 × C4 × C2, or G_1. Let G be a group of order 96. If G is abelian, then by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, G is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1. C96\n2. C48 × C2\n3. C32 × C3\n4. C24 × C4\n5. C16 × C6\n6. C8 × C12\n7. C8 × C4 × C3\n8. C4 × C4 × C6\n\nOut of these groups, only C96 is cyclic. The group A4 × C4 × C2 is isomorphic to the group C8 × C4 × C3, which is abelian. Therefore, if G is abelian, it is isomorphic to either C96 or A4 × C4 × C2.\n\nIf G is non-abelian, then by our previous analysis, G is isomorphic to G_1. Thus, every group of order 96 is isomorphic to either C96, A4 × C4 × C2, or G_1."
