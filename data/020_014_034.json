    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products, A and B. The production of each requires a specific amount of resources:\n\n- Product A requires 2 units of resource X and 3 units of resource Y.\n- Product B requires 4 units of resource X and 1 unit of resource Y.\n\nThe company has a total of 20 units of resource X and 15 units of resource Y. The profit made by the company from the sale of each unit of A is $5 and from each unit of B is $7. What is the maximum profit the company can make by producing both products?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. We have the following constraints:\n\n2x + 4y ≤ 20 (resource X constraint)\n3x + y ≤ 15 (resource Y constraint)\nx ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is the profit function:\n\nP(x, y) = 5x + 7y\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we will first find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. 2x + 4y ≤ 20 => y ≤ 5 - 0.5x\n2. 3x + y ≤ 15 => y ≤ 15 - 3x\n3. x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0,0), (0,5), (4,3), and (5,0). Now, we will evaluate the profit function at each vertex:\n\n1. P(0,0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0\n2. P(0,5) = 5(0) + 7(5) = 35\n3. P(4,3) = 5(4) + 7(3) = 41\n4. P(5,0) = 5(5) + 7(0) = 25\n\nThe maximum profit is $41, which occurs when the company produces 4 units of product A and 3 units of product B."
