    "message_2": "To determine the current in the circuit at t = 0.02 seconds, we first need to find the impedance (Z) of the circuit. The impedance of a series RLC circuit is given by the formula:\n\nZ = √(R^2 + (XL - XC)^2)\n\nwhere R is the resistance, XL is the inductive reactance, and XC is the capacitive reactance. \n\nThe inductive reactance (XL) is given by the formula:\n\nXL = 2 * π * f * L\n\nwhere f is the frequency and L is the inductance. \n\nThe capacitive reactance (XC) is given by the formula:\n\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * f * C)\n\nwhere f is the frequency and C is the capacitance.\n\nFirst, let's calculate XL and XC:\n\nXL = 2 * π * 60 Hz * 0.1 H = 37.6991 ohms\nXC = 1 / (2 * π * 60 Hz * 0.01 F) = 265.258 ohms\n\nNow, we can calculate the impedance (Z):\n\nZ = √((10 ohms)^2 + (37.6991 ohms - 265.258 ohms)^2) = √(100 + (-227.559)^2) = 227.777 ohms\n\nNow that we have the impedance, we can find the current in the circuit. The voltage source is given as a 12V sinewave with a frequency of 60 Hz. The instantaneous voltage at any time t can be expressed as:\n\nV(t) = Vm * sin(2 * π * f * t)\n\nwhere Vm is the maximum voltage (12V), f is the frequency (60 Hz), and t is the time. \n\nAt t = 0.02 seconds, the instantaneous voltage is:\n\nV(0.02) = 12V * sin(2 * π * 60 Hz * 0.02 s) = 12V * sin(7.54) = 11.976 V\n\nNow, we can use Ohm's Law to find the current in the circuit:\n\nI(t) = V(t) / Z\n\nI(0.02) = 11.976 V / 227.777 ohms = 0.0526 A\n\nTherefore, the current in the circuit at t = 0.02 seconds is approximately 0.0526 A."
