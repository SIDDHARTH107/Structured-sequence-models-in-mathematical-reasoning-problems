    "message_2": "To show that G is isomorphic to either C8, Q8, or D4, we will first find all possible subgroup structures for G and then compare them to the subgroup structures of C8, Q8, and D4.\n\nSince G has order 8, by the Sylow theorems, there must be a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8. Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. Then |P| = 8, and P is a normal subgroup of G since it is the unique Sylow 2-subgroup.\n\nNow, we consider the possible structures of P. There are three possibilities:\n\n1. P is cyclic, i.e., P is isomorphic to C8.\n2. P is a quaternion group, i.e., P is isomorphic to Q8.\n3. P is a dihedral group, i.e., P is isomorphic to D4.\n\nWe will analyze each case and show that G is isomorphic to one of these groups.\n\nCase 1: P is cyclic (P ≅ C8)\nIf P is cyclic, then there exists an element of order 8 in G. Let g be such an element. Then G = ⟨g⟩, and G is a cyclic group of order 8. Thus, G is isomorphic to C8.\n\nCase 2: P is a quaternion group (P ≅ Q8)\nIf P is a quaternion group, then G has the same structure as Q8. In this case, G has a unique element of order 2 and six elements of order 4. Since G has the same structure as Q8, G is isomorphic to Q8.\n\nCase 3: P is a dihedral group (P ≅ D4)\nIf P is a dihedral group, then G has the same structure as D4. In this case, G has four elements of order 2 and four elements of order 4. Since G has the same structure as D4, G is isomorphic to D4.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that G is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C8, the quaternion group Q8, or the dihedral group D4 by finding all possible subgroup structures for G and comparing them to the subgroup structures of C8, Q8, and D4."
