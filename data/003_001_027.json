    "message_1": "A student is standing 10 meters away from the base of a building. The angle of elevation from the student to the top of the building is 60 degrees. What is the height of the building?",
    "message_2": "To find the height of the building, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.\n\nIn this case, the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the side adjacent to the angle is the distance from the student to the base of the building (10 meters), and the side opposite the angle is the height of the building (which we want to find).\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\ntan(60°) = height / 10\n\nThe tangent of 60 degrees is equal to the square root of 3:\n\n√3 = height / 10\n\nNow, we can solve for the height by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10:\n\nheight = 10 * √3\n\nheight ≈ 10 * 1.732\n\nheight ≈ 17.32 meters\n\nTherefore, the height of the building is approximately 17.32 meters."
