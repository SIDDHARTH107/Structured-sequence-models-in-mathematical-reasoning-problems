Therefore, $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the domain containing the circle $|z - 1| = 2$.\n\nSince $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the domain containing the circle, we can apply Cauchy's theorem to conclude that the integral of $f(z)$ along the circle is zero:\n\n$$\\oint_{|z - 1| = 2} (z^2 + 2z + 4) \\, dz = 0$$"
