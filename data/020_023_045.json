    "message_1": "Assuming that there are three assets: A, B, and C, with expected returns of 12%, 7%, and 5%, respectively, and standard deviations of 15%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. Determine the optimal portfolio allocation that minimizes risk with a target return of 8%. Suppose further that you have a budget of $100,000 to invest. What is the optimal amount of money to allocate to each asset to achieve the target return?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal portfolio allocation that minimizes risk with a target return of 8%, we need to use the concept of portfolio weights. Let the weights of assets A, B, and C be represented by w_A, w_B, and w_C, respectively. The sum of these weights should equal 1, as they represent the proportion of the total investment in each asset.\n\nThe target return of 8% can be represented as:\n\n0.08 = w_A * 0.12 + w_B * 0.07 + w_C * 0.05\n\nWe also have the constraint:\n\nw_A + w_B + w_C = 1\n\nTo minimize risk, we need to find the portfolio weights that minimize the portfolio's standard deviation. The standard deviation of the portfolio can be represented as:\n\nσ_p = √(w_A^2 * σ_A^2 + w_B^2 * σ_B^2 + w_C^2 * σ_C^2 + 2 * w_A * w_B * Cov(A, B) + 2 * w_A * w_C * Cov(A, C) + 2 * w_B * w_C * Cov(B, C))\n\nHowever, we need the covariance between the assets to calculate the portfolio's standard deviation. Since the covariance is not provided, we will assume that the assets are uncorrelated, meaning their covariance is zero. This simplifies the standard deviation formula to:\n\nσ_p = √(w_A^2 * σ_A^2 + w_B^2 * σ_B^2 + w_C^2 * σ_C^2)\n\nTo find the optimal weights, we can use numerical optimization techniques such as the Solver function in Excel or Python's scipy.optimize library. After solving for the optimal weights, we can then calculate the optimal amount of money to allocate to each asset by multiplying the weights by the total investment of $100,000.\n\nFor example, if the optimal weights are found to be w_A = 0.4, w_B = 0.3, and w_C = 0.3, the optimal amount of money to allocate to each asset would be:\n\nA: $100,000 * 0.4 = $40,000\nB: $100,000 * 0.3 = $30,000\nC: $100,000 * 0.3 = $30,000"
