    "message_2": "To solve the given non-homogeneous system of linear equations using matrix methods, we'll first write the augmented matrix for the system:\n\n```\n[ 3  4 -2 |  5 ]\n[ 2  5  3 | 18 ]\n[ 1 -1  2 |  2 ]\n```\n\nNow, we'll perform Gaussian elimination to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Swap row 1 and row 3:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 |  2 ]\n[ 2  5  3 | 18 ]\n[ 3  4 -2 |  5 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace row 2 with (-2 * row 1) + row 2, and replace row 3 with (-3 * row 1) + row 3:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 |  2 ]\n[ 0  7 -1 | 14 ]\n[ 0  7 -8 | -1 ]\n```\n\n3. Replace row 3 with row 3 - row 2:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 |  2 ]\n[ 0  7 -1 | 14 ]\n[ 0  0 -7 | -15 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in row-echelon form. We can use back-substitution to find the values of x, y, and z:\n\n1. Divide row 3 by -7:\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  2 |  2 ]\n[ 0  7 -1 | 14 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 15/7 ]\n```\n\n2. Replace row 2 with (row 3 + row 2) and row 1 with (-2 * row 3 + row 1):\n\n```\n[ 1 -1  0 | -16/7 ]\n[ 0  7  0 | 29/7 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 15/7 ]\n```\n\n3. Divide row 2 by 7 and replace row 1 with (row 2 + row 1):\n\n```\n[ 1  0  0 |  1/7 ]\n[ 0  1  0 | 29/49 ]\n[ 0  0  1 | 15/7 ]\n```\n\nNow, we have the matrix in reduced row-echelon form, and we can read the solution directly:\n\nx = 1/7\ny = 29/49\nz = 15/7"
