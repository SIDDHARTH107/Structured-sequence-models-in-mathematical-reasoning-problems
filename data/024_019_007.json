    "message_2": "The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the total Gaussian curvature of a closed surface is equal to 2π times the Euler characteristic of the surface. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\n∫∫K dA = 2πχ\n\nwhere K is the Gaussian curvature, dA is the area element, and χ is the Euler characteristic.\n\nFor a sphere, the Gaussian curvature K is constant and equal to 1/R^2, where R is the radius of the sphere. In this case, R = 5 cm, so the Gaussian curvature K = 1/(5^2) = 1/25 cm^(-2).\n\nThe surface area of a sphere is given by A = 4πR^2. For our sphere with radius 5 cm, the surface area A = 4π(5^2) = 100π cm^2.\n\nNow, we can use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to find the Euler characteristic:\n\n∫∫K dA = (1/25) * 100π = 2πχ\n\nSolving for χ, we get:\n\nχ = (1/25) * 100π / 2π = 2\n\nSo, the total Gaussian curvature of the sphere is 1/25 cm^(-2), and the Euler characteristic is 2."
