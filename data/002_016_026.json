    "message_1": "A student needs to determine the length of each side of an equilateral triangle with a perimeter of 36 cm. What is the length of each side?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of each side of an equilateral triangle, we can divide the perimeter by the number of sides. An equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides.\n\nLength of each side = Perimeter / Number of sides\nLength of each side = 36 cm / 3\nLength of each side = 12 cm\n\nEach side of the equilateral triangle is 12 cm long."
