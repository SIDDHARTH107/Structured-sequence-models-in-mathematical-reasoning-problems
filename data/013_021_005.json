If player 1 always chooses to pass the pot to player 2 and player 2 always chooses to take the pot, how much money will player 1 and player 2 end up with at the end of the game?",
    "message_2": "In the Centipede Game, when a player passes the pot, the pot doubles in size. Since player 1 always chooses to pass the pot and player 2 always chooses to take the pot, the game will proceed as follows:\n\nRound 1:\nPlayer 1 passes the $100 pot to player 2.\nPot doubles to $200.\n\nPlayer 2 takes the $200 pot.\nPlayer 2 now has $50 (initial) + $200 = $250.\n\nRound 2:\nPlayer 1 passes the $100 pot to player 2 again.\nPot doubles to $200.\n\nPlayer 2 takes the $200 pot.\nPlayer 2 now has $250 (from round 1) + $200 = $450.\n\nRound 3:\nPlayer 1 passes the $100 pot to player 2 again.\nPot doubles to $200.\n\nPlayer 2 takes the $200 pot.\nPlayer 2 now has $450 (from round 2) + $200 = $650.\n\nRound 4:\nPlayer 1 passes the $100 pot to player 2 again.\nPot doubles to $200.\n\nPlayer 2 takes the $200 pot.\nPlayer 2 now has $650 (from round 3) + $200 = $850.\n\nRound 5:\nPlayer 1 passes the $100 pot to player 2 again.\nPot doubles to $200.\n\nPlayer 2 takes the $200 pot.\nPlayer 2 now has $850 (from round 4) + $200 = $1050.\n\nAt the end of the 5-round Centipede Game, player 1 will have $0, and player 2 will have $1050."
