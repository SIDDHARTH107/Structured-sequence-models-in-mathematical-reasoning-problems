    "message_1": "A right triangle has one leg measuring 12 cm and the other leg measuring 16 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem?",
    "message_2": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). The formula is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nIn this case, one leg (a) is 12 cm and the other leg (b) is 16 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nc² = 12² + 16²\nc² = 144 + 256\nc² = 400\n\nNow, to find the length of the hypotenuse (c), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\nc = √400\nc = 20\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is 20 cm."
