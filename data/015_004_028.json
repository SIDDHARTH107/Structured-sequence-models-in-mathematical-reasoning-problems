    "message_2": "To find the area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set, we can use the polar equation of the cardioid:\n\nr(θ) = 1 - cos(θ)\n\nwhere r is the distance from the origin to the point on the curve, and θ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point on the curve.\n\nTo find the area of the cardioid, we can use the polar integral formula for area:\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫[r(θ)]² dθ\n\nWe need to integrate r(θ)² from 0 to 2π:\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫[(1 - cos(θ))²] dθ, from 0 to 2π\n\nLet's expand the square:\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫[(1 - 2cos(θ) + cos²(θ))] dθ, from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, we can use the double-angle formula for cos²(θ):\n\ncos²(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫[(1 - 2cos(θ) + (1 + cos(2θ))/2)] dθ, from 0 to 2π\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫[(2 - 4cos(θ) + 1 + cos(2θ))/2] dθ, from 0 to 2π\n\nArea = 1/2 * ∫[(3 - 4cos(θ) + cos(2θ))/2] dθ, from 0 to 2π\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\nArea = 1/2 * [∫(3/2) dθ - ∫(4cos(θ)) dθ + ∫(cos(2θ)/2) dθ], from 0 to 2π\n\nArea = 1/2 * [(3/2)θ - 4sin(θ) + (1/4)sin(2θ)] evaluated from 0 to 2π\n\nArea = 1/2 * [(3/2)(2π) - 4sin(2π) + (1/4)sin(4π) - (3/2)(0) + 4sin(0) - (1/4)sin(0)]\n\nArea = 1/2 * [(3π)]\n\nArea = (3/2)π\n\nThe area of the main cardioid in the Mandelbrot set is approximately (3/2)π, which is approximately 4.7 when rounded to the nearest tenth."
