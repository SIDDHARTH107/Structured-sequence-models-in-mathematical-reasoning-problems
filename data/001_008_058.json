    "message_2": "To solve the inequality 2x + 5 > 11, we'll first isolate the variable x by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:\n   2x + 5 - 5 > 11 - 5\n   2x > 6\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2:\n   2x / 2 > 6 / 2\n   x > 3\n\nSo the solution to the inequality is x > 3.\n\nTo graph this solution on the number line, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a number line with numbers from 0 to 6 (or more if you prefer).\n2. Locate the number 3 on the number line.\n3. Since the inequality is x > 3 (and not x â‰¥ 3), we'll represent 3 with an open circle.\n4. Shade the region to the right of the open circle, indicating that all numbers greater than 3 are part of the solution.\n\nThe graph should look like this:\n\n```\n-----(3)------>\n```\n\nWhere the open circle represents 3 and the arrow to the right indicates that all numbers greater than 3 are part of the solution."
