    "message_1": "Sorry, I cannot provide you with a precise numerical problem regarding Non-monotonic logic as it deals with reasoning and making decisions based on incomplete or uncertain information, and not necessarily numerical calculations. Non-monotonic logic is more about understanding how certain assumptions can be accepted or rejected based on new information or context. However, I can provide you with a sample question related to non-monotonic logic that a math student may be asked to solve:\n\nWhat is the difference between classical logic and non-monotonic logic, and how can non-monotonic logic be applied in real-world scenarios?",
    "message_2": "The main difference between classical logic and non-monotonic logic lies in how they handle new information and the conclusions drawn from it.\n\nClassical logic is monotonic, meaning that once a conclusion is derived from a set of premises, adding more premises will not change or retract that conclusion. In other words, the conclusions in classical logic are always consistent and do not change with new information.\n\nOn the other hand, non-monotonic logic allows for conclusions to be revised or retracted when new information is introduced. This type of logic is more flexible and better suited for handling situations with incomplete or uncertain information. In non-monotonic logic, a conclusion can be accepted based on the current information, but it may be rejected later if new information contradicts it.\n\nNon-monotonic logic can be applied in various real-world scenarios, particularly in fields like artificial intelligence, expert systems, and knowledge representation. Some examples include:\n\n1. Default reasoning: Non-monotonic logic can be used to make assumptions based on typical situations. For example, if we know that birds typically fly, we can assume that a newly discovered bird species can fly unless we find evidence to the contrary.\n\n2. Belief revision: In situations where new information contradicts previously held beliefs, non-monotonic logic can be used to revise those beliefs. For example, a medical diagnosis may be revised when new test results become available.\n\n3. Planning and decision-making: Non-monotonic logic can be applied to make decisions based on incomplete information and update those decisions as new information becomes available. For example, a robot navigating an unknown environment may make decisions based on its current knowledge and update its plan as it discovers new obstacles or pathways.\n\nOverall, non-monotonic logic is a valuable tool for reasoning and decision-making in situations where information is incomplete or uncertain, making it applicable to a wide range of real-world scenarios."
