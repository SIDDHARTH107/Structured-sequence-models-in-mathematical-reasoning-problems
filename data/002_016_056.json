    "message_1": "A side of an equilateral triangle measures 12 cm. What is the length of the altitude of the triangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the length of the altitude of an equilateral triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. In an equilateral triangle, the altitude bisects the base, creating two 30-60-90 right triangles. Let's denote the length of the altitude as h.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides is 1:√3:2. Since the altitude bisects the base, each half of the base has a length of 12 cm / 2 = 6 cm. Now, we can set up the equation using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n(6 cm)^2 + h^2 = (12 cm)^2\n36 cm^2 + h^2 = 144 cm^2\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh^2 = 144 cm^2 - 36 cm^2\nh^2 = 108 cm^2\nh = √108 cm\n\nTo simplify the square root, we can factor 108:\n\n108 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 3 = (2 * 3)^2 * 3\n\nSo, the length of the altitude is:\n\nh = √(6^2 * 3) = 6√3 cm"
