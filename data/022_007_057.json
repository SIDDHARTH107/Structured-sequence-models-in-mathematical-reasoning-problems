    "message_2": "To prove that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 4, we will use the Cauchy estimates for the derivatives of f(z). \n\nRecall that if f(z) is an entire function and g(z) is a holomorphic function on an open set containing a closed disc D(a, R) centered at a with radius R, then for all n ∈ N and z ∈ D(a, R),\n\n|f^n(z)| ≤ (n! / R^n) * max{ |f(w)| : w ∈ C, |w - a| = R }\n\nNow, let's apply the Cauchy estimates to f(z) and its derivatives. Since |f(z)| ≤ |z|^4 for all z ∈ C, we have\n\n|f^n(z)| ≤ (n! / R^n) * max{ |f(w)| : w ∈ C, |w - a| = R } ≤ (n! / R^n) * R^4\n\nfor all z ∈ D(a, R). \n\nNow, let's consider the limit as R goes to infinity:\n\nlim (R → ∞) (n! / R^n) * R^4 = n! * lim (R → ∞) (R^4 / R^n)\n\nIf n > 4, then the limit is 0, which implies that f^n(z) = 0 for all z ∈ C. This means that the nth derivative of f(z) is identically zero for all n > 4. Since f(z) is an entire function, this implies that f(z) is a polynomial of degree at most 4."
