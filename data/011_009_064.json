    "message_1": "A restaurant has a menu with 10 dishes. How many ways can a customer order 5 different dishes if they want to try each dish exactly once?",
    "message_2": "To find the number of ways a customer can order 5 different dishes out of 10, we need to use the combination formula. The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of dishes (10 in this case) and k is the number of dishes the customer wants to order (5 in this case). The exclamation mark (!) denotes the factorial of a number.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5!5!)\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) × (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1))\n\nC(10, 5) = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)\n\nC(10, 5) = 30,240 / 120\n\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\nSo, there are 252 different ways a customer can order 5 different dishes out of 10."
