Let $\\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ be the line bundle on $X$ associated to the divisor $(1,0)-(0,1)$ and let $K_X$ be the canonical bundle on $X$.

    "message_2": "To find the dimension of the space $\\text{H}^0(X, K_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_X(2))$, we first need to determine the canonical bundle $K_X$ of the smooth plane cubic curve $X$. \n\nFor a smooth plane curve of degree $d$, the canonical bundle is given by $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(d-3)$. In our case, the curve $X$ is a cubic curve, so $d=3$. Therefore, the canonical bundle is $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(0)$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the tensor product $K_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_X(2)$. Since $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(0)$, we have:\n\n$K_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_X(2) = \\mathcal{O}_X(0) \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_X(2) = \\mathcal{O}_X(2)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the dimension of the space $\\text{H}^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(2))$. The global sections of $\\mathcal{O}_X(2)$ correspond to the homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 in the variables $x$, $y$, and $z$ that are regular on $X$. These polynomials are given by:\n\n$ax^2 + bxy + cxz + dy^2 + eyz + fz^2$,\n\nwhere $a, b, c, d, e, f$ are complex coefficients. There are 6 coefficients, so the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 has dimension 6.\n\nHowever, we need to account for the fact that the curve $X$ is defined by the equation $y^2z = x(x-z)(x-\\lambda z)$. We need to find the polynomials that are regular on $X$, meaning that they do not have any common factors with the defining equation of $X$. Since the defining equation is a cubic polynomial, any polynomial of degree 2 will not have any common factors with it. Therefore, all homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 are regular on $X$.\n\nThus, the dimension of the space $\\text{H}^0(X, K_X \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_X(2)) = \\text{H}^0(X, \\mathcal{O}_X(2))$ is 6."
