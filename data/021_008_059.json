    "message_2": "To apply Newton's method to a system of nonlinear equations, we need to compute the Jacobian matrix and its inverse. Let's denote the given system of equations as:\n\nF(x, y) = (f1(x, y), f2(x, y)) = (x^2 + y^2 - 9, y - x^2 + 2x)\n\nThe Jacobian matrix J(x, y) is given by:\n\nJ(x, y) = | df1/dx  df1/dy |\n          | df2/dx  df2/dy |\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\ndf1/dx = 2x\ndf1/dy = 2y\ndf2/dx = -2x + 2\ndf2/dy = 1\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n\nJ(x, y) = |  2x   2y |\n          | -2x+2  1 |\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, J^(-1)(x, y):\n\nJ^(-1)(x, y) = (1/det(J)) * |  1   -2y |\n                             | 2x-2  2x |\n\nwhere det(J) = 2x - (-2x+2)(2y) = 2x - 4xy + 4y.\n\nNow, we can apply Newton's method iteratively using the following formula:\n\n(x, y)_(n+1) = (x, y)_n - J^(-1)(x, y)_n * F(x, y)_n\n\nLet's start with an initial guess (x, y)_0 = (1, 1). We will iterate until the difference between consecutive (x, y) values is less than 0.001.\n\nIteration 1:\nF(1, 1) = (1^2 + 1^2 - 9, 1 - 1^2 + 2*1) = (-7, 1)\nJ^(-1)(1, 1) = (1/(2 - 4 + 4)) * |  1  -2 |\n                                 |  0   2 |\n               = (1/2) * |  1  -2 |\n                         |  0   2 |\n\n(x, y)_1 = (1, 1) - (1/2) * (-7, 1) = (1 + 7/2, 1 - 1/2) = (4.5, 0.5)\n\nIteration 2:\nF(4.5, 0.5) ≈ (0.25, -0.25)\nJ^(-1)(4.5, 0.5) ≈ (1/5) * |  1  -1 |\n                           | -7   9 |\n\n(x, y)_2 ≈ (4.5, 0.5) - (1/5) * (0.25, -0.25) = (4.5 - 0.05, 0.5 + 0.05) = (4.45, 0.55)\n\nThe difference between (x, y)_1 and (x, y)_2 is less than 0.001, so we can stop here.\n\nThus, the solution (x, y) accurate to three decimal places is (4.450, 0.550)."
