    "message_2": "The surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSurface Area = 2 * π * r * (r + h)\n\nwhere r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.\n\nIn this case, the radius (r) is 5 cm and the height (h) is 10 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nSurface Area = 2 * π * 5 * (5 + 10)\n\nSurface Area = 2 * π * 5 * 15\n\nSurface Area = 150 * π\n\nThe surface area of the cylinder is approximately 471.24 square centimeters."
