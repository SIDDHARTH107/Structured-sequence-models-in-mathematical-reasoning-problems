    "message_2": "The conjugate gradient method is not the most suitable method for this problem since it is a linear programming problem, not a quadratic optimization problem. Instead, we can use the simplex method or other linear programming techniques to solve this problem.\n\nLet x1, x2, and x3 be the number of hours Machine M1, M2, and M3 run, respectively. We want to maximize the total production of each product, subject to the constraints of the machines' production rates and the maximum of 10 hours per day for each machine.\n\nObjective function:\nMaximize Z = 10x1 + 5x2 + 3x3 (for P1) + 7x1 + 9x2 + 6x3 (for P2) + 8x1 + 14x2 + 4x3 (for P3) + 10x1 + 12x2 + 8x3 (for P4)\n\nConstraints:\nx1 <= 10 (Machine M1 can run up to 10 hours)\nx2 <= 10 (Machine M2 can run up to 10 hours)\nx3 <= 10 (Machine M3 can run up to 10 hours)\n\nNow we can use the simplex method or other linear programming techniques to solve this problem.\n\nAfter solving the linear programming problem, we get the optimal solution:\n\nx1 = 10 hours (Machine M1)\nx2 = 10 hours (Machine M2)\nx3 = 10 hours (Machine M3)\n\nThe maximum number of units produced with this schedule is:\n\nZ = 10(10) + 5(10) + 3(10) + 7(10) + 9(10) + 6(10) + 8(10) + 14(10) + 4(10) + 10(10) + 12(10) + 8(10) = 100 + 50 + 30 + 70 + 90 + 60 + 80 + 140 + 40 + 100 + 120 + 80 = 970 units\n\nThis production schedule will produce 970 units, which is the maximum number of units that can be produced with the given constraints."
