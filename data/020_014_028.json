    "message_2": "To find the global minimum of the function f(x) = x^4 - 8x^3 + 15x^2 + 20 over the interval [-1, 3], we need to first find the critical points of the function. We do this by finding the first derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero.\n\nf'(x) = 4x^3 - 24x^2 + 30x\n\nNow, we set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 4x^3 - 24x^2 + 30x\n\nWe can factor out a 2x from the equation:\n\n0 = 2x(2x^2 - 12x + 15)\n\nNow, we can further factor the quadratic inside the parentheses:\n\n0 = 2x(2x - 3)(x - 5)\n\nThis gives us three critical points: x = 0, x = 3/2, and x = 5. However, since we are only considering the interval [-1, 3], we will only consider the critical points x = 0 and x = 3/2.\n\nNow we need to check the endpoints of the interval, which are x = -1 and x = 3. We will evaluate the function at these points, as well as at the critical points, and compare the values to determine the global minimum.\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^4 - 8(-1)^3 + 15(-1)^2 + 20 = 1 + 8 + 15 + 20 = 44\nf(0) = 0^4 - 8(0)^3 + 15(0)^2 + 20 = 20\nf(3/2) = (3/2)^4 - 8(3/2)^3 + 15(3/2)^2 + 20 = 27/16 - 27 + 45/2 + 20 = 33/16\nf(3) = 3^4 - 8(3)^3 + 15(3)^2 + 20 = 81 - 216 + 135 + 20 = 20\n\nComparing the values, we find that the global minimum occurs at x = 3/2, with a value of f(3/2) = 33/16."
