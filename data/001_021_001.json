    "message_2": "To find the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0, we can use the factoring method.\n\nWe need to find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to 5. These numbers are 2 and 3. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx^2 + 2x + 3x + 6 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor by grouping:\n\nx(x + 2) + 3(x + 2) = 0\n\nNow, we can factor out the common term (x + 2):\n\n(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0\n\nNow, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\nx + 2 = 0 => x = -2\nx + 3 = 0 => x = -3\n\nSo, the roots of the polynomial equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 are x = -2 and x = -3."
