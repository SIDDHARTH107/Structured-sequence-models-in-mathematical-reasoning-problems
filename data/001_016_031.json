    "message_2": "To simplify the expression $3^{5} \\cdot 3^{3}$, we can use the rule of exponents that states when multiplying two exponential expressions with the same base, we can add the exponents. In this case, the base is 3, and the exponents are 5 and 3.\n\nSo, $3^{5} \\cdot 3^{3} = 3^{(5+3)} = 3^{8}$.\n\nThe simplified expression is $3^{8}$."
