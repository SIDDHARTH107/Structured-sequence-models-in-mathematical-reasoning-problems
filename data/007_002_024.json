    "message_2": "To find the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 9 and 15, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 15.\n\nFirst, find the prime factorization of each number:\n9 = 3^2\n15 = 3 × 5\n\nNow, take the highest power of each prime factor and multiply them together:\nLCM(9, 15) = 3^2 × 5 = 9 × 5 = 45\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 9 and 15 is 45."
