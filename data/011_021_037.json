The distance between each pair of cities is given below: \n\n| Cities | City 1 | City 2 | City 3 | City 4 | City 5 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| City 1 |   0    |   10   |   20   |   35   |   25   |\n| City 2 |   10   |   0    |   15   |   30   |   20   |\n| City 3 |   20   |   15   |   0    |   45   |   30   |\n| City 4 |   35   |   30   |   45   |   0    |   10   |\n| City 5 |   25   |   20   |   30   |   10   |   0    |\n\nWhat is the shortest possible route that the salesman can take to visit all the cities exactly once and return to the starting city?",
    "message_2": "To find the shortest possible route, we can use the brute force method by listing all possible permutations of the cities and calculating the total distance for each permutation. Since there are 5 cities, there are 5! (5 factorial) = 120 possible permutations. However, since the route is circular, we can divide this number by 5, resulting in 24 unique routes to consider. Here are the routes and their total distances:\n\n1. City 1 → City 2 → City 3 → City 4 → City 5 → City 1: 10 + 15 + 45 + 10 + 25 = 105\n2.
