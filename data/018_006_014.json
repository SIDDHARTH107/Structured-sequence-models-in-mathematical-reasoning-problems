    "message_1": "Let U be the universal set with 50 elements. Let A be a subset of U with 20 elements. What is the number of elements in the complement of A, and what is the total number of elements in the union of A and its complement? Verify that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U.",
    "message_2": "The complement of A, denoted as A', contains all the elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Since U has 50 elements and A has 20 elements, the complement of A has 50 - 20 = 30 elements.\n\nThe union of A and its complement A' is the set of all elements that are either in A or in A' (or in both). Since A and A' together contain all the elements in the universal set U, the union of A and A' is equal to U. Therefore, the total number of elements in the union of A and its complement is equal to the number of elements in U, which is 50.\n\nTo verify that the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U, we can show that every element in U is either in A or A'. Since A is a subset of U, all elements in A are also in U. Similarly, all elements in A' are also in U, as A' contains all elements in U that are not in A. Therefore, the union of A and A' contains all elements in U, and the union of A and its complement is equal to the universal set U."
