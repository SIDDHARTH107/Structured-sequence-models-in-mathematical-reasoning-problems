    "message_1": "A right triangle has an opposite side of length 6 inches and an adjacent side of length 8 inches. Find the length of the hypotenuse. (Round your answer to the nearest tenth.)",
    "message_2": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In this case, the opposite side (a) is 6 inches and the adjacent side (b) is 8 inches. The formula for the Pythagorean theorem is:\n\nc² = a² + b²\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\nc² = (6 inches)² + (8 inches)²\nc² = 36 square inches + 64 square inches\nc² = 100 square inches\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the length of the hypotenuse (c):\n\nc = √100 square inches\nc = 10 inches\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 10 inches."
