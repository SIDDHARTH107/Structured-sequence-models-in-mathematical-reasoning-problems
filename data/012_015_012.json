    "message_2": "A graph with 6 vertices can have a maximum of 15 edges if it is a complete graph (i.e., every vertex is connected to every other vertex). In this case, the graph has 7 edges, which is less than the maximum possible edges. However, this does not necessarily mean that the graph is disconnected.\n\nTo determine if the graph is connected or disconnected, we can use the fact that a connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. In this case, n = 6, so a connected graph must have at least 5 edges. Since our graph has 7 edges, it is possible for the graph to be connected.\n\nNow, let's consider the cut vertices. A cut vertex is a vertex whose removal (along with its incident edges) increases the number of connected components in the graph. To identify cut vertices, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Start with an arbitrary vertex and perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the graph.\n2. During the DFS traversal, keep track of the discovery time and low values for each vertex.\n3. A vertex is a cut vertex if it is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children, or if it is not the root and has a child whose low value is greater than or equal to the discovery time of the vertex.\n\nWithout knowing the specific arrangement of the vertices and edges in the graph, we cannot determine the exact cut vertices. However, we can conclude that the graph is connected, and there may be one or more cut vertices depending on the graph's structure."
