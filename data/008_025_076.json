    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix notation, we first write the given system in the form AX = B, where A is the matrix of coefficients, X is the column matrix of variables, and B is the column matrix of constants.\n\nA = | 2  1 |\n    | 4  2 |\n\nX = | x |\n    | y |\n\nB = | 3 |\n    | 6 |\n\nNow, we can find the determinant of matrix A, det(A).\n\ndet(A) = (2 * 2) - (1 * 4) = 4 - 4 = 0\n\nSince the determinant of A is 0, the given system of linear equations does not have a unique solution. To check if it has no solution or infinitely many solutions, we can use the augmented matrix and perform row operations to get it in row-echelon form.\n\nAugmented matrix:\n\n| 2  1 | 3 |\n| 4  2 | 6 |\n\nRow operation: R2 = R2 - 2 * R1\n\n| 2  1 |  3 |\n| 0  0 |  0 |\n\nThe second row of the row-echelon form represents the equation 0x + 0y = 0, which is always true. This means the system has infinitely many solutions, not no solution."
