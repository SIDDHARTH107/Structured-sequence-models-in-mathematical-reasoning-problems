    "message_2": "If a number is not divisible by 3, it can have a remainder of 1 or 2 when divided by 3. Let's consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: The number has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 (i.e., the number is of the form 3n + 1, where n is an integer).\n\nWhen the number is squared, we have:\n\n(3n + 1)^2 = 9n^2 + 6n + 1\n\nNow, when this squared number is divided by 3, we have:\n\n(9n^2 + 6n + 1) / 3 = 3n^2 + 2n + 1/3\n\nSince 3n^2 and 2n are both divisible by 3, the remainder when the squared number is divided by 3 is 1.\n\nCase 2: The number has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 (i.e., the number is of the form 3n + 2, where n is an integer).\n\nWhen the number is squared, we have:\n\n(3n + 2)^2 = 9n^2 + 12n + 4\n\nNow, when this squared number is divided by 3, we have:\n\n(9n^2 + 12n + 4) / 3 = 3n^2 + 4n + 4/3\n\nSince 3n^2 and 4n are both divisible by 3, the remainder when the squared number is divided by 3 is 1.\n\nIn both cases, the remainder when the number is raised to the power of 2 and divided by 3 is 1."
