    "message_1": "A flagpole is 25 feet tall. If an observer standing 50 feet away from the flagpole measures the angle of elevation to the top of the flagpole as 40 degrees, what is the height of the observer?",
    "message_2": "Let's use the tangent function to solve this problem. The tangent function relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (height difference between the observer and the flagpole) and the adjacent side (distance between the observer and the flagpole).\n\nLet h be the height of the observer. Then, the height difference between the observer and the flagpole is (25 - h).\n\ntan(angle) = opposite side / adjacent side\ntan(40°) = (25 - h) / 50\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\n50 * tan(40°) = 25 - h\nh = 25 - 50 * tan(40°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nh ≈ 25 - 50 * 0.8391\nh ≈ 25 - 41.955\nh ≈ -16.955\n\nSince the height of the observer cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement. It is likely that the angle of elevation is incorrect or the flagpole is shorter than the observer's height. Please check the problem statement and provide the correct information."
