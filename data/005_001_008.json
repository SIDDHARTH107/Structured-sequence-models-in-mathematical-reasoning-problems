    "message_1": "A math student is testing a hypothesis at a 5% significance level using a one-tailed t-test. The null hypothesis is that the population mean is 15, and the alternative hypothesis is that the population mean is greater than 15. The sample size is 25, and the sample mean is 16.5 with a standard deviation of 2.5. What is the calculated t-statistic and the p-value for this test?",
    "message_2": "To calculate the t-statistic, we can use the formula:\n\nt = (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nt = (16.5 - 15) / (2.5 / sqrt(25))\nt = 1.5 / (2.5 / 5)\nt = 1.5 / 0.5\nt = 3\n\nThe calculated t-statistic is 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the p-value for this t-statistic. Since we are using a one-tailed t-test with a 5% significance level, we can use a t-distribution table or a calculator to find the p-value. The degrees of freedom for this test are:\n\ndegrees of freedom = sample size - 1\ndegrees of freedom = 25 - 1\ndegrees of freedom = 24\n\nUsing a t-distribution table or calculator for a t-statistic of 3 and 24 degrees of freedom, we find that the p-value is approximately 0.0027.\n\nSo, the calculated t-statistic is 3, and the p-value is approximately 0.0027."
