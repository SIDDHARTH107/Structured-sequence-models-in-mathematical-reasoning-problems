Prove that there exist open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U, B ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = Ø.\n\nSuppose X is a Hausdorff space and A, B are two disjoint closed sets.  Using separation axioms, prove that there exist open sets U and V such that A is a subset of U, B is a subset of V, and U and  V are disjoint.",
    "message_2": "Since X is a Hausdorff space, for any two distinct points x ∈ A and y ∈ B, there exist open neighborhoods U_x and V_y such that x ∈ U_x, y ∈ V_y, and U_x ∩ V_y = Ø. This is due to the T2 separation axiom of Hausdorff spaces.\n\nNow, for each x ∈ A, let U_x be an open set containing x such that U_x ∩ V_y = Ø for some open set V_y containing y ∈ B. Similarly, for each y ∈ B, let V_y be an open set containing y such that U_x ∩ V_y = Ø for some open set U_x containing x ∈ A.\n\nDefine U = ⋃_{x ∈ A} U_x and V = ⋃_{y ∈ B} V_y. Since the union of open sets is open, both U and V are open sets. Furthermore, since A ⊆ ⋃_{x ∈ A} U_x and B ⊆ ⋃_{y ∈ B} V_y, we have A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V.\n\nNow we need to show that U ∩ V = Ø. Suppose there exists a point z ∈ U ∩ V. Then z ∈ U_x for some x ∈ A and z ∈ V_y for some y ∈ B. However, this contradicts the fact that U_x ∩ V_y = Ø for all x ∈ A and y ∈ B. Therefore, U ∩ V = Ø.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U, B ⊆ V, and U ∩ V = Ø, as required."
