    "message_2": "To find the number of observations that fall within one standard deviation of the mean, we need to determine the range of values that are within one standard deviation above and below the mean.\n\nMean = 50\nStandard Deviation = 10\n\nOne standard deviation below the mean:\n50 - 10 = 40\n\nOne standard deviation above the mean:\n50 + 10 = 60\n\nSo, we are looking for the number of observations that fall within the range of 40 to 60.\n\nHowever, we cannot determine the exact number of observations within this range without more information about the distribution of the data. If the data follows a normal distribution, we can use the empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule) which states that approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.\n\nIn this case, 68% of 100 observations would be:\n0.68 * 100 = 68\n\nSo, approximately 68 observations fall within one standard deviation of the mean (between 40 and 60) if the data follows a normal distribution."
