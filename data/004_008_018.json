    "message_2": "To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve of the function f(x) = x^2 at the point where x = 3, we need to find the derivative of the function and then evaluate it at x = 3.\n\nThe function is f(x) = x^2. To find its derivative, we use the power rule, which states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = n * x^(n-1).\n\nApplying the power rule to f(x) = x^2, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 2 * x^(2-1) = 2x\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the derivative at x = 3:\n\nf'(3) = 2 * 3 = 6\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line to the curve of the function f(x) = x^2 at the point where x = 3 is 6."
