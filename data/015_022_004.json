    "message_2": "To solve the Mackey-Glass equation numerically, we can use a numerical integration method such as the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. However, since the equation involves a time delay (tau), we need to modify the method to account for the delay. One such method is the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method with continuous delay. \n\nI will provide you with a Python code that uses the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method to solve the Mackey-Glass equation for the given parameters and time t = 200.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef mackey_glass(t, x, a, b, c, tau, n):\n    if t < tau:\n        x_tau = 1.2\n    else:\n        x_tau = np.interp(t - tau, t_points, x_points)\n    dxdt = (a * x_tau) / (1 + x_tau**n) - b * x + c\n    return dxdt\n\na = 0.2\nb = 0.1\nc = 0.9\ntau = 17.0\nn = 10.0\nx0 = 1.2\nt_end = 200\n\nt_points = np.linspace(0, t_end, 10000)\nx_points = np.zeros_like(t_points)\nx_points[0] = x0\n\nsol = solve_ivp(mackey_glass, (0, t_end), [x0], args=(a, b, c, tau, n), t_eval=t_points, dense_output=True)\n\nfor i, t in enumerate(t_points):\n    x_points[i] = sol.sol(t)[0]\n\nprint(\"The numerical solution for the Mackey-Glass equation at time t = 200 is:\", x_points[-1])\n```\n\nYou can run this code in a Python environment to obtain the numerical solution for the Mackey-Glass equation at time t = 200 with the given parameters. Note that the result may vary slightly depending on the numerical method and the chosen time step."
