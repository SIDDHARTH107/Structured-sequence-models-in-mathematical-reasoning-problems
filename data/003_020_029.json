    "message_1": "A helicopter is flying at an altitude of 500 meters. The pilot needs to choose an angulation to reach the destination which is 2000 meters away from the current position. What is the angle of depression that the pilot needs to fly on to reach the destination? Round the answer to the nearest degree.",
    "message_2": "To find the angle of depression, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. In this case, the opposite side is the altitude (500 meters) and the adjacent side is the horizontal distance (2000 meters).\n\ntan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(angle) = 500 / 2000\ntan(angle) = 0.25\n\nNow, we need to find the angle whose tangent is 0.25. We can do this using the inverse tangent function (arctan or tan^(-1)).\n\nangle = arctan(0.25)\nangle â‰ˆ 14.04 degrees\n\nRounding to the nearest degree, the angle of depression the pilot needs to fly on to reach the destination is approximately 14 degrees."
