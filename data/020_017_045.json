    "message_2": "To maximize the area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter, we can use the following formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = length × width.\n\nLet the length of the rectangle be L and the width be W. Since the perimeter is fixed at 24 units, we can write the perimeter formula as follows:\n\nPerimeter = 2 × (L + W) = 24\n\nNow, we can solve for one of the variables, say W:\n\nW = (24 - 2L) / 2 = 12 - L\n\nNow, we can express the area in terms of L:\n\nArea = L × W = L × (12 - L)\n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of the area with respect to L and set it to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dL = 12 - 2L = 0\n\nSolving for L:\n\n2L = 12\nL = 6\n\nNow, we can find the width using the formula we derived earlier:\n\nW = 12 - L = 12 - 6 = 6\n\nSo, the dimensions of the rectangle that maximize the area are length L = 6 units and width W = 6 units. This is actually a square, which makes sense because a square is the rectangle with the largest area for a given perimeter."
