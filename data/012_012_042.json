    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of G, we will use the following inequality:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor((2 * |E|) / |V|)\n\nwhere |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices in the graph.\n\nIn our case, |E| = 15 and |V| = 12. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get:\n\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor((2 * 15) / 12)\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor(30 / 12)\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * floor(2.5)\ngirth(G) ≤ 2 * 2\ngirth(G) ≤ 4\n\nSo, the girth of G is at most 4. Now, we need to check if there exists a cycle of length 4 in the graph. Since the inequality holds, it is possible to have a cycle of length 4 in the graph. Therefore, the girth of G is 4."
