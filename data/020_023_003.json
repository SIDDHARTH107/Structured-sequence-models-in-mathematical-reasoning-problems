    "message_1": "Suppose you have a portfolio consisting of four stocks: A, B, C, and D. The expected returns and standard deviations for each stock are given in the table below. You want to invest in these stocks in such a way that you minimize the risk (measured by the standard deviation) while achieving an expected return of at least 10%.\n\n| Stock | Expected Return | Standard Deviation |\n|-------|----------------|--------------------|\n| A     | 12%            | 15%                |\n| B     | 8%             | 10%                |\n| C     | 10%            | 12%                |\n| D     | 15%            | 20%                |\n\nUsing the optimization techniques you learned in class, determine the minimum standard deviation that can be achieved while maintaining an expected return of at least 10%.",
    "message_2": "To find the minimum standard deviation while maintaining an expected return of at least 10%, we need to use the concept of portfolio optimization. We will use the following notations:\n\n- wA, wB, wC, and wD are the weights of stocks A, B, C, and D in the portfolio, respectively.\n- E(R) is the expected return of the portfolio.\n- σ is the standard deviation of the portfolio.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. wA + wB + wC + wD = 1 (The sum of the weights should be equal to 1)\n2. E(R) = wA * 12% + wB * 8% + wC * 10% + wD * 15% (Expected return of the portfolio)\n3. E(R) ≥ 10% (We want an expected return of at least 10%)\n\nOur objective is to minimize the standard deviation of the portfolio, which can be represented as:\n\nσ = √(wA² * σA² + wB² * σB² + wC² * σC² + wD² * σD² + 2 * wA * wB * Cov(A, B) + 2 * wA * wC * Cov(A, C) + 2 * wA * wD * Cov(A, D) + 2 * wB * wC * Cov(B, C) + 2 * wB * wD * Cov(B, D) + 2 * wC * wD * Cov(C, D))\n\nHowever, we don't have the covariance values between the stocks. In this case, we can only find the minimum standard deviation under the assumption that the stocks are uncorrelated (Cov(A, B) = Cov(A, C) = Cov(A, D) = Cov(B, C) = Cov(B, D) = Cov(C, D) = 0). This simplifies the standard deviation formula to:\n\nσ = √(wA² * σA² + wB² * σB² + wC² * σC² + wD² * σD²)\n\nNow, we can set up a quadratic optimization problem with the constraints and the objective function. This can be solved using optimization techniques such as the Lagrange multiplier method or quadratic programming.\n\nHowever, without the covariance values, we cannot provide an exact solution for the minimum standard deviation that can be achieved while maintaining an expected return of at least 10%."
