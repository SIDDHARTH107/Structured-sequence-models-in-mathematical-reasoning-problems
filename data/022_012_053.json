    "message_1": "Consider the meromorphic function f(z) = (z + 2)/(z^2 + 5z + 6). \n\nWhat are the poles and zeros of f(z)? \n\nDetermine whether f(z) has any removable singularities or essential singularities, and justify your answer.\n\nFind the residues of f(z) at each of its poles.",
    "message_2": "To find the zeros of f(z), we set the numerator equal to zero:\n\nz + 2 = 0\nz = -2\n\nSo, f(z) has a single zero at z = -2.\n\nTo find the poles of f(z), we set the denominator equal to zero:\n\nz^2 + 5z + 6 = 0\n(z + 2)(z + 3) = 0\n\nThis gives us two poles at z = -2 and z = -3. However, since the zero at z = -2 cancels out the pole at z = -2, it is not a true pole but a removable singularity. Therefore, f(z) has only one pole at z = -3.\n\nSince f(z) is a rational function and the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, there are no essential singularities.\n\nNow, let's find the residue of f(z) at its pole z = -3. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nResidue = lim (z -> z0) [(z - z0) * f(z)]\n\nIn our case, z0 = -3:\n\nResidue = lim (z -> -3) [(z + 3) * (z + 2) / ((z + 2)(z + 3))]\nResidue = lim (z -> -3) [1]\n\nThe residue of f(z) at its pole z = -3 is 1."
