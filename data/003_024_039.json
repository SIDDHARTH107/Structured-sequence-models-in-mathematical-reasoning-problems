    "message_2": "To find the projection of vector A onto vector B, we can use the formula:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (A · B) / ||B||^2 * B\n\nwhere A · B is the dot product of A and B, and ||B|| is the magnitude of B.\n\nFirst, let's find the dot product of A and B:\n\nA · B = (2 * 3) + (5 * 4) = 6 + 20 = 26\n\nNext, let's find the magnitude of B:\n\n||B|| = √(3^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n\nNow, let's find the square of the magnitude of B:\n\n||B||^2 = 5^2 = 25\n\nNow we can find the projection of A onto B:\n\nProjection of A onto B = (26 / 25) * B = (26 / 25) * <3, 4> = <(26/25)*3, (26/25)*4> = <78/25, 104/25>\n\nSo, the projection of vector A onto vector B is <78/25, 104/25>."
