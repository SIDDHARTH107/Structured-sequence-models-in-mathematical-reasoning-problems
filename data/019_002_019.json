    "message_1": "Here's a precise numerical problem for a math student to solve in Predicate Logic:\n\nUsing predicate logic, express the statement \"All men are mortal\" in symbols. Then, use the same symbols to express the statement \"Socrates is a man\". Finally, use logical inference to conclude whether \"Socrates is mortal\".\n\nSolution: \n\nLet's define the following symbols:\n\n- M(x): \"x is a man\"\n- S: \"Socrates\"\n\nThe statement \"All men are mortal\" can be expressed as:\n∀x(M(x) => Mortal(x))\n\nThe statement \"Socrates is a man\" can be expressed as:\nM(S)\n\nUsing logical inference, we can conclude:\nM(S) is true, and ∀x(M(x) => Mortal(x)) is true.\nTherefore, Mortal(S) is true.\n\nConclusion: Socrates is mortal.",
    "message_2": "Apologies for the repetition. To reiterate:\n\nUsing predicate logic, we have expressed the statement \"All men are mortal\" as ∀x(M(x) => Mortal(x)) and the statement \"Socrates is a man\" as M(S). Through logical inference, we have concluded that Mortal(S) is true, meaning Socrates is mortal."
