Suppose that $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Determine the group $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.",
    "message_2": "To determine the group $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology. The theorem states that for any topological space X and abelian group G, there is a short exact sequence:\n\n$0 \\rightarrow Ext^1(H_{n-1}(X), G) \\rightarrow H^n(X, G) \\rightarrow Hom(H_n(X), G) \\rightarrow 0$\n\nIn our case, we have G = $\\mathbb{Z}$, and we want to determine $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. We first need to find the homology groups $H_2(X)$ and $H_3(X)$.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot determine the homology groups $H_2(X)$ and $H_3(X)$ based on the given information about the cohomology groups $H^0(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, and $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. The cohomology groups and homology groups are related, but the given information is not sufficient to determine the homology groups.\n\nIf we had more information about the homology groups, we could apply the Universal Coefficient Theorem to find $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$."
