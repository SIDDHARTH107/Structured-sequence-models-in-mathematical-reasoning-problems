    "message_2": "To find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of three numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the prime factors of each number.\n2. Write down the highest power of each prime factor that occurs in any of the numbers.\n3. Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given numbers: 12, 18, and 30.\n\n1. Prime factors:\n   12 = 2^2 * 3^1\n   18 = 2^1 * 3^2\n   30 = 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1\n\n2. Highest powers of each prime factor:\n   2: The highest power is 2^2 (from 12).\n   3: The highest power is 3^2 (from 18).\n   5: The highest power is 5^1 (from 30).\n\n3. Multiply the highest powers together:\n   LCM = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^1 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 36 * 5 = 180\n\nSo, the LCM of 12, 18, and 30 is 180."
