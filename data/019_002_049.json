    "message_2": "Let's represent the statement using predicate logic:\n\n∀x ∃y (x + y = 10)\n\nThis statement says that for any real number x, there exists a real number y such that their sum is equal to 10.\n\nTo evaluate whether this statement is true or false, let's try to find a value for y in terms of x that satisfies the equation:\n\nx + y = 10\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 10 - x\n\nSince x is a real number, 10 - x will also be a real number. Therefore, for any real number x, there exists a real number y (which is 10 - x) such that their sum is equal to 10.\n\nHence, the statement is true."
