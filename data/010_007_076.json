Let $\\gamma: [0,1]\\rightarrow X$ be a loop at a basepoint $x_0\\in X$ such that $\\gamma(t)=x_0$ for all $t\\in[0,1/2]$. If $\\widetilde{x_0}\\in p^{-1}(x_0)$ is a basepoint in the fiber of $p(\\widetilde{x_0})=x_0$ and $\\widetilde{\\gamma}(t)\\in p^{-1}(\\gamma(t))$ is the unique lift of $\\gamma$ starting at $\\widetilde{x_0}$, then find the isomorphism between the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X,x_0)$ and the group $\\pi_1(\\widetilde{X},\\widetilde{x_0})$ via the induced map $p_*:\\pi_1(\\widetilde{X},\\widetilde{x_0})\\rightarrow\\pi_1(X,x_0)$ on the level of fundamental groups induced by $p$.",
    "message_2": "Since $\\widetilde{X}$ is the universal cover of $X$, the fundamental group of $\\widetilde{X}$ is trivial, i.e., $\\pi_1(\\widetilde{X}, \\widetilde{x_0}) = \\{1\\}$. Now, we want to find the isomorphism between $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ and $\\pi_1(\\widetilde{X}, \\widetilde{x_0})$ via the induced map $p_*: \\pi_1(\\widetilde{X}, \\widetilde{x_0}) \\rightarrow \\pi_1(X, x_0)$.\n\nSince $\\pi_1(\\widetilde{X}, \\widetilde{x_0})$ is trivial, the induced map $p_*$ sends the identity element of $\\pi_1(\\widetilde{X}, \\widetilde{x_0})$ to the identity element of $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$. Thus, $p_*(1) = 1$. \n\nNow, let's consider an element $[\\alpha] \\in \\pi_1(X, x_0)$. Since $p$ is a covering map, there exists a unique lift $\\widetilde{\\alpha}$ of $\\alpha$ starting at $\\widetilde{x_0}$. Since $\\widetilde{X}$ is simply connected, $\\widetilde{\\alpha}$ is homotopic to the constant loop at $\\widetilde{x_0}$. Therefore, $p_*(\\widetilde{\\alpha}) = \\alpha$.\n\nThus, the induced map $p_*$ is an isomorphism between $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ and $\\pi_1(\\widetilde{X}, \\widetilde{x_0})$. However, since $\\pi_1(\\widetilde{X}, \\widetilde{x_0})$ is trivial, this implies that $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is also trivial. In other words, $X$ is simply connected."
