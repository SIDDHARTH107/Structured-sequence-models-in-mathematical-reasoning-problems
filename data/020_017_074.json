    "message_2": "To minimize the integral of the function f(x) over the interval [0, 3], we need to find the critical points of the function and then determine which of these points results in the minimum value of the integral.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6) = 3x^2 - 12x + 11\n\nNow, let's find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:\n\n3x^2 - 12x + 11 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:\n\n(3x - 11)(x - 1) = 0\n\nThe solutions are x = 1 and x = 11/3. However, since x = 11/3 is not in the interval [0, 3], we only consider x = 1.\n\nNow, let's check the endpoints of the interval [0, 3] and the critical point x = 1 to determine which value of x minimizes the integral of f(x) over the interval [0, 3].\n\nThe integral of f(x) from 0 to x is:\n\nF(x) = âˆ«(x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6) dx = (1/4)x^4 - 2x^3 + (11/2)x^2 - 6x + C\n\nWe can ignore the constant of integration C since we are only interested in the relative values of the integral at different points.\n\nNow, let's evaluate F(x) at the endpoints and the critical point:\n\nF(0) = 0\nF(1) = (1/4)(1)^4 - 2(1)^3 + (11/2)(1)^2 - 6(1) = -1/4\nF(3) = (1/4)(3)^4 - 2(3)^3 + (11/2)(3)^2 - 6(3) = 27/4 - 54 + 99/2 - 18 = -9/4\n\nSince F(1) = -1/4 is the largest value among F(0), F(1), and F(3), the integral of f(x) over the interval [0, 3] is minimized when x = 1."
