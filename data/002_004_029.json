    "message_1": "A rectangle has a length of 8 cm and a width of 3 cm. What is the perimeter of the rectangle?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm and the width is 3 cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (8 + 3) = 2 * 11 = 22 cm\n\nSo, the perimeter of the rectangle is 22 cm."
