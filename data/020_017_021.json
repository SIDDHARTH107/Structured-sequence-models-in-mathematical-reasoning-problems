    "message_1": "A cable company has to lay a cable from point A to point B, which are 500 meters apart, underwater. The cost of laying the cable is proportional to the distance it has to cover underwater. If it costs $200 per meter to lay the cable underwater and $100 per meter to lay it over the ground, how much of the cable should be laid underwater to minimize the total cost of laying the cable?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the distance of the cable laid underwater, and y be the distance of the cable laid over the ground. We know that the total distance is 500 meters, so we can write the equation:\n\nx + y = 500\n\nThe cost of laying the cable underwater is $200 per meter, and the cost of laying it over the ground is $100 per meter. So, the total cost (C) can be represented as:\n\nC = 200x + 100y\n\nWe want to minimize the total cost, so we need to find the minimum value of C. To do this, we can use the constraint equation (x + y = 500) to eliminate one of the variables. Let's solve for y:\n\ny = 500 - x\n\nNow substitute this expression for y into the cost equation:\n\nC = 200x + 100(500 - x)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nC = 200x + 50000 - 100x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC = 100x + 50000\n\nNow we need to find the minimum value of C. Since the cost is linear with respect to x, the minimum cost will occur at one of the endpoints of the feasible region. In this case, the feasible region is 0 ≤ x ≤ 500.\n\nEndpoint 1: x = 0 (no cable laid underwater)\nC = 100(0) + 50000 = 50000\n\nEndpoint 2: x = 500 (all cable laid underwater)\nC = 100(500) + 50000 = 100000\n\nThe minimum cost occurs when x = 0, which means that no cable should be laid underwater. All 500 meters of the cable should be laid over the ground to minimize the total cost."
