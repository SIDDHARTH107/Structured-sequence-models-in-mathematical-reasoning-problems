    "message_2": "The Dragon curve is a fractal that is created by folding a strip of paper in half repeatedly, and then unfolding it so that each fold creates a 90-degree angle. The length of the Dragon curve after each iteration can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = Initial length * (2^(n/2))\n\nwhere n is the number of iterations.\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after the 6th iteration. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLength = 1 * (2^(6/2))\nLength = 1 * (2^3)\nLength = 1 * 8\nLength = 8\n\nSo, the length of the Dragon curve after the 6th iteration is 8."
