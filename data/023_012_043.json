    "message_2": "To find the Fourier series of the given function, we need to calculate the coefficients a_n and b_n for the Fourier series representation:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(n * x) + b_n * sin(n * x)]\n\nwhere the summation is from n = 1 to infinity.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] f(x) dx\n\nSince f(x) = 1 for -π < x < 0 and f(x) = -1 for 0 < x < π, we can split the integral into two parts:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [∫[-π to 0] 1 dx + ∫[0 to π] (-1) dx]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [x | from -π to 0 + (-x) | from 0 to π]\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [0 - (-π) + (0 - π)]\n\na_0 = 0\n\nNow, let's find a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] f(x) * cos(n * x) dx\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π to 0] 1 * cos(n * x) dx + ∫[0 to π] (-1) * cos(n * x) dx]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π to 0] cos(n * x) dx - ∫[0 to π] cos(n * x) dx]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [sin(n * x) / n | from -π to 0 - sin(n * x) / n | from 0 to π]\n\na_n = (1/π) * [(0 - sin(-n * π) / n) - (sin(n * π) / n - 0)]\n\nSince sin(n * π) = 0 for all integer values of n, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nNow, let's find b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π to π] f(x) * sin(n * x) dx\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π to 0] 1 * sin(n * x) dx + ∫[0 to π] (-1) * sin(n * x) dx]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [∫[-π to 0] sin(n * x) dx - ∫[0 to π] sin(n * x) dx]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [-cos(n * x) / n | from -π to 0 + cos(n * x) / n | from 0 to π]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-cos(0) + cos(-n * π)) / n + (cos(n * π) - cos(0)) / n]\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1 - cos(n * π)) / n + (cos(n * π) - 1) / n]\n\nFor odd values of n, cos(n * π) = -1, and for even values of n, cos(n * π) = 1. Since the function is odd, we only need to consider odd values of n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(1 - (-1)) / n + ((-1) - 1) / n] = (2/π) * (2/n)\n\nSo, the Fourier series representation of the given function is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(4/π) * (1/n) * sin(n * x)] for odd values of n\n\nNow, let's find the nth term for n = 1, 2, and 3:\n\nn = 1: (4/π) * (1/1) * sin(1 * x) = (4/π) * sin(x)\n\nn = 2: Since n is even, the term is 0.\n\nn = 3: (4/π) * (1/3) * sin(3 * x) = (4/3π) * sin(3x)\n\nSo, the first three terms of the Fourier series are:\n\n(4/π) * sin(x) + 0 + (4/3π) * sin(3x)"
