    "message_2": "The area of the largest black bulb in the Mandelbrot set, which is the main cardioid, can be found using the formula for the area of a cardioid: A = (1/2)πa^2, where 'a' is the radius of the cardioid.\n\nThe boundary of the Mandelbrot set has a perimeter of approximately 11.1 units. The largest black bulb, the main cardioid, has a perimeter that is approximately 80% of the total perimeter of the Mandelbrot set. Therefore, the perimeter of the main cardioid is approximately 0.8 * 11.1 ≈ 8.88 units.\n\nThe perimeter of a cardioid can be calculated using the formula P = 8a. We can use this formula to find the radius 'a' of the main cardioid:\n\n8a ≈ 8.88\na ≈ 1.11\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the area of the main cardioid using the formula A = (1/2)πa^2:\n\nA ≈ (1/2)π(1.11)^2\nA ≈ 1.9371π\n\nTherefore, the area of the largest black bulb in the Mandelbrot set is approximately 1.9371π square units."
