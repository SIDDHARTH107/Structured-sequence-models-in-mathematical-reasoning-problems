    "message_2": "To find the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |2x + 3| - 4, we first need to find the value of x that makes the expression inside the absolute value equal to zero.\n\n2x + 3 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x = -3\nx = -3/2\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging this value back into the equation:\n\ny = |2(-3/2) + 3| - 4\ny = |(-3 + 3)| - 4\ny = |0| - 4\ny = 0 - 4\ny = -4\n\nSo, the vertex of the absolute value equation y = |2x + 3| - 4 is (-3/2, -4)."
