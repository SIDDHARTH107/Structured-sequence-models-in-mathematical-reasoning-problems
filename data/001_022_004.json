    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts of the polynomial function f(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x - 6, we need to find the values of x when f(x) = 0.\n\nx^3 + 4x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0\n\nWe can use factoring or synthetic division to find the roots of this polynomial. In this case, we can factor by grouping:\n\nx^2(x + 4) - 1(x + 4) = 0\n(x^2 - 1)(x + 4) = 0\n\nNow, we can further factor the difference of squares:\n\n(x - 1)(x + 1)(x + 4) = 0\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = 1, x = -1, and x = -4.\n\nTo find the turning points, we need to find the critical points of the function by taking the first derivative and setting it equal to 0:\n\nf'(x) = 3x^2 + 8x - 5\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the critical points:\n\nx = (-B ± √(B^2 - 4AC)) / 2A\n\nx = (-8 ± √(8^2 - 4(3)(-5))) / (2(3))\nx = (-8 ± √(64 + 60)) / 6\nx = (-8 ± √124) / 6\n\nThe critical points are x = (-8 + √124) / 6 and x = (-8 - √124) / 6.\n\nNow, we need to determine if these critical points are turning points (local maxima or minima) by using the second derivative test:\n\nf''(x) = 6x + 8\n\nFor the first critical point, x = (-8 + √124) / 6:\n\nf''((-8 + √124) / 6) = 6((-8 + √124) / 6) + 8\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, this critical point is a local minimum.\n\nFor the second critical point, x = (-8 - √124) / 6:\n\nf''((-8 - √124) / 6) = 6((-8 - √124) / 6) + 8\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, this critical point is a local maximum.\n\nSo, the turning points are at x = (-8 + √124) / 6 (local minimum) and x = (-8 - √124) / 6 (local maximum)."
