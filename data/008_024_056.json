    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. However, first, we need to check if the system has multiple solutions. We can do this by checking if the equations are linearly dependent.\n\nNotice that the third equation is a multiple of the first equation. If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:\n\n2(x + 2y - 3z) = 2(4)\n2x + 4y - 6z = 8\n\nSince the third equation is a multiple of the first equation, the system of linear equations is linearly dependent and has multiple solutions.\n\nNow, let's eliminate one of the variables to find the relationship between the remaining variables. We can eliminate x by multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 1, and then subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n\n(3x - y + 4z) - (3x + 6y - 9z) = 1 - 12\n-7y + 13z = -11\n\nNow, we can express y in terms of z:\n\ny = (13z + 11) / 7\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y back into the first equation:\n\nx + 2((13z + 11) / 7) - 3z = 4\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 7 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n7x + 2(13z + 11) - 21z = 28\n\nNow, distribute the 2 and simplify:\n\n7x + 26z + 22 - 21z = 28\n7x + 5z = 6\n\nNow, we can express x in terms of z:\n\nx = (6 - 5z) / 7\n\nSince we have expressed both x and y in terms of z, we can write the general solution as:\n\nx = (6 - 5z) / 7\ny = (13z + 11) / 7\nz = z\n\nwhere z can be any real number. This represents the multiple solutions of the given system of linear equations."
