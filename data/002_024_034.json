    "message_1": "A trapezium has a length of 6 cm and 9 cm for each of its parallel sides. The distance between the parallel sides is 5 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides (the non-parallel sides). Let's call these sides a and b.\n\nWe can divide the trapezium into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side. Let's call the length of this line h.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles. In the first right triangle, the hypotenuse is a, one leg is h, and the other leg is (9-6)/2 = 1.5 cm (since the perpendicular line divides the difference in the lengths of the parallel sides equally). In the second right triangle, the hypotenuse is b, one leg is h, and the other leg is also 1.5 cm.\n\nWe know that the distance between the parallel sides is 5 cm, which is equal to h. Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of a and b.\n\nFor the first right triangle:\na^2 = h^2 + 1.5^2\na^2 = 5^2 + 1.5^2\na^2 = 25 + 2.25\na^2 = 27.25\na = √27.25\na ≈ 5.22 cm\n\nFor the second right triangle:\nb^2 = h^2 + 1.5^2\nb^2 = 5^2 + 1.5^2\nb^2 = 25 + 2.25\nb^2 = 27.25\nb = √27.25\nb ≈ 5.22 cm\n\nNow that we have the lengths of all sides, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium:\nPerimeter = 6 cm + 9 cm + 5.22 cm + 5.22 cm\nPerimeter ≈ 25.44 cm"
