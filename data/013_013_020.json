    "message_1": "One possible question for a math student to solve within Auction Theory could be:\n\nSuppose a sealed-bid second-price auction is being held for a painting between two bidders, Alice and Bob. Alice values the painting at $2000, and Bob values it at $3000. They both simultaneously submit their bids to the auctioneer, who announces that Bob has won the auction with a price of $2500. How much profit did Alice make, assuming she only bids exactly how much she values the painting?\n\nTo solve this problem, the math student would need to understand the mechanics of a sealed-bid second-price auction, as well as how to calculate profits given a certain bidding strategy.",
    "message_2": "In a sealed-bid second-price auction, each bidder submits a sealed bid, and the highest bidder wins the auction. However, the winner pays the second-highest bid price, not their own bid price.\n\nIn this case, Alice values the painting at $2000 and Bob values it at $3000. Assuming they both bid exactly how much they value the painting, Alice would bid $2000 and Bob would bid $3000. Since Bob has the highest bid, he wins the auction. However, he pays the second-highest bid price, which is Alice's bid of $2000.\n\nNow, we need to calculate Alice's profit. Since Alice did not win the auction, she did not gain the painting nor did she pay any money. Therefore, her profit is $0."
