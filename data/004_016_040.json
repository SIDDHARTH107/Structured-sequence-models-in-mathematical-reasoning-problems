Find the time at which the car reaches its average speed between the time $x=2$ hours and the time $x=4$ hours.",
    "message_2": "To find the average speed between the time $x=2$ hours and the time $x=4$ hours, we first need to find the total distance traveled during that time interval. We can do this by integrating the speed function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ over the interval $[2, 4]$.\n\nThe total distance traveled is given by the integral:\n\n$$D = \\int_{2}^{4} (8x - x^2) dx$$\n\nWe can find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n\n$$F(x) = \\int (8x - x^2) dx = 4x^2 - \\frac{1}{3}x^3 + C$$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n\n$$D = F(4) - F(2) = \\left[4(4)^2 - \\frac{1}{3}(4)^3\\right] - \\left[4(2)^2 - \\frac{1}{3}(2)^3\\right]$$\n\n$$D = \\left[64 - \\frac{64}{3}\\right] - \\left[16 - \\frac{8}{3}\\right] = \\frac{48}{3} - \\frac{40}{3} = \\frac{8}{3}$$\n\nSo, the total distance traveled between $x=2$ and $x=4$ is $\\frac{8}{3}$ miles.\n\nNow, we can find the average speed during this time interval:\n\n$$\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}}{4-2} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}}{2} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ mph}$$\n\nTo find the time at which the car reaches its average speed, we need to find the value of $x$ for which $f(x) = \\frac{4}{3}$:\n\n$$\\frac{4}{3} = 8x - x^2$$\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n$$x^2 - 8x + \\frac{4}{3} = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = -8$, and $c = \\frac{4}{3}$. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\n$$x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(1)\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)}}{2(1)}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - \\frac{16}{3}}}{2}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{176}{3}}}{2}$$\n\nThere are two possible solutions for $x$, but since we are looking for the time between $x=2$ and $x=4$, we can discard the solution that is outside this interval. By testing, we find that the solution within the interval is:\n\n$$x = \\frac{8 - \\sqrt{\\frac{176}{3}}}{2} \\approx 2.552$$\n\nSo, the car reaches its average speed of $\\frac{4}{3}$ mph at approximately $x \\approx 2.552$ hours."
