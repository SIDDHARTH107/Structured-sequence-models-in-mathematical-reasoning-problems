    "message_1": "A rectangular prism has a length of 6 cm, a width of 4 cm, and a height of 5 cm. What is its surface area?",
    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a rectangular prism, we need to calculate the area of each of its six faces and then add them together. The formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism is:\n\nSurface Area = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh\n\nwhere l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.\n\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular prism: l = 6 cm, w = 4 cm, and h = 5 cm.\n\nSurface Area = 2(6)(4) + 2(6)(5) + 2(4)(5)\nSurface Area = 48 + 60 + 40\nSurface Area = 148 cmÂ²\n\nThe surface area of the rectangular prism is 148 square centimeters."
