    "message_1": "A seller has one unit of a good to sell, and there are two potential buyers, A and B. The seller values the good at $10, while buyer A values it at $15 and buyer B values it at $5. The seller must decide whether to auction the good to the highest bidder or to sell it at a fixed price of $12. Assume that both buyers know each other's valuations. \nWhat mechanism should the seller use to maximize his revenue?",
    "message_2": "To determine the best mechanism for the seller to maximize their revenue, let's analyze both options: auction and fixed price.\n\n1. Auction:\nIn an auction, both buyers will bid based on their valuations. Since buyer A values the good at $15 and buyer B values it at $5, buyer A will outbid buyer B. The final price will be slightly above $5 (assuming buyer A bids just enough to outbid buyer B). In this case, the seller's revenue will be slightly above $5.\n\n2. Fixed Price:\nThe seller sets a fixed price of $12 for the good. Buyer A values the good at $15, so they will be willing to buy it at the fixed price of $12. Buyer B values the good at $5, so they will not buy it at the fixed price of $12. In this case, the seller's revenue will be $12.\n\nComparing the two mechanisms, the seller will maximize their revenue by selling the good at a fixed price of $12."
