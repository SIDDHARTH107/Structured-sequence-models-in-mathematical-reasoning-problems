    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Central Limit Theorem and the z-score formula. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nGiven:\nPopulation mean (μ) = $800\nPopulation standard deviation (σ) = $50\nSample size (n) = 25\nSample mean (x̄) = $790\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard deviation of the sample mean (σx̄). We can do this using the formula:\n\nσx̄ = σ / √n\n\nσx̄ = 50 / √25\nσx̄ = 50 / 5\nσx̄ = 10\n\nNow, we will find the z-score for the sample mean. The z-score is the number of standard deviations away from the population mean a particular value is. We can find the z-score using the formula:\n\nz = (x̄ - μ) / σx̄\n\nz = (790 - 800) / 10\nz = -10 / 10\nz = -1\n\nNow that we have the z-score, we can find the probability that the sample mean is less than $790 using a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function. The probability corresponds to the area under the standard normal curve to the left of the z-score.\n\nP(x̄ < 790) = P(z < -1)\nP(z < -1) ≈ 0.1587\n\nSo, the probability that the sample's mean daily revenue will be less than $790 is approximately 15.87%."
