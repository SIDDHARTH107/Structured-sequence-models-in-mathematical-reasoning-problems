    "message_2": "To write the problem in standard form, we first introduce slack variables $s_1$ and $s_2$ to convert the inequalities into equalities. We have:\n\nMinimize $2x_1 + 3x_2$\n\nSubject to:\n$x_1 + x_2 - s_1 = 2$\n\n$x_1 - x_2 + s_2 = 3$\n\n$x_1, x_2, s_1, s_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n\nNow, we can write the problem in matrix form:\n\nMinimize $c^T x$\n\nSubject to:\n$Ax = b$\n\nWhere $c = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, $x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ s_1 \\\\ s_2 \\end{bmatrix}$, $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, and $b = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nTo solve this problem using semi-definite programming, we need to express it as a semi-definite program. However, this problem is a linear program, not a semi-definite program, as there are no constraints on the variables being positive semidefinite matrices. Therefore, we cannot solve this problem using semi-definite programming.\n\nInstead, we can solve this problem using linear programming techniques, such as the simplex method or interior-point methods."
