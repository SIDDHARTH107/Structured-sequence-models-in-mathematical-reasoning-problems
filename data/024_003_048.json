    "message_2": "To find the Gaussian curvature (K) of the surface, we first need to compute the first and second fundamental forms. Let's start by finding the partial derivatives of the parametric equations:\n\nx_u = ∂x/∂u = 2\nx_v = ∂x/∂v = 0\ny_u = ∂y/∂u = 0\ny_v = ∂y/∂v = 6v\nz_u = ∂z/∂u = 12u^2\nz_v = ∂z/∂v = 3v^2\n\nNow, let's find the coefficients of the first fundamental form (E, F, and G):\n\nE = <x_u, y_u, z_u> • <x_u, y_u, z_u> = (2^2 + 0^2 + (12u^2)^2)\nF = <x_u, y_u, z_u> • <x_v, y_v, z_v> = (2 * 0 + 0 * 6v + 12u^2 * 3v^2)\nG = <x_v, y_v, z_v> • <x_v, y_v, z_v> = (0^2 + (6v)^2 + (3v^2)^2)\n\nAt the point (1, 2), we have:\n\nE = 2^2 + 0^2 + (12 * 1^2)^2 = 4 + 144 = 148\nF = 2 * 0 + 0 * 6 * 2 + 12 * 1^2 * 3 * 2^2 = 0\nG = 0^2 + (6 * 2)^2 + (3 * 2^2)^2 = 144 + 144 = 288\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficients of the second fundamental form (L, M, and N):\n\nL = N_x • <x_uu, y_uu, z_uu> = 0 (since x_uu, y_uu, and z_uu are all 0)\nM = N_x • <x_uv, y_uv, z_uv> = 0 (since x_uv and y_uv are 0)\nN = N_x • <x_vv, y_vv, z_vv> = 0 (since x_vv and z_vv are 0)\n\nNow, we can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula:\n\nK = (LN - M^2) / (EG - F^2)\n\nK = (0 * 0 - 0^2) / (148 * 288 - 0^2) = 0 / (42544) = 0\n\nSo, the Gaussian curvature of the surface at the point (1, 2) is 0."
