    "message_1": "Sure! Here's a stochastic optimization problem:\n\nSuppose we have a company that produces widgets. The cost of producing each widget is given by a random variable $X$ with distribution $\\mathcal{N}(10, 2)$, where 10 is the mean cost and 2 is the standard deviation. The company wants to produce $n$ widgets, where $n$ is a parameter that we can vary.\n\nThe company can sell each widget for a fixed price of \\$17. However, if the cost of producing a widget is greater than \\$14, the company will have to sell it for a discounted price of \\$15 to stay competitive. Our goal is to find the value of $n$ that maximizes the expected profit of the company.\n\nAssuming that the demand for widgets is high enough that the company can sell as many widgets as it produces, what is the optimal value of $n$ that maximizes the expected profit, and what is the expected profit in dollars?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal value of $n$ that maximizes the expected profit, we first need to calculate the expected profit per widget. Let's denote the profit per widget as $P(X)$. If the cost of producing a widget is less than or equal to $14, P(X) = 17 - X$. If the cost is greater than $14, P(X) = 15 - X$. \n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the cost of producing a widget is greater than $14$. Since the cost follows a normal distribution with mean $10$ and standard deviation $2$, we can standardize the value $14$ as follows:\n\n$Z = \\frac{14 - 10}{2} = 2$\n\nNow, we can look up the probability in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator to find the probability that $Z \\leq 2$. This probability is approximately $0.9772$. Therefore, the probability that the cost is greater than $14$ is $1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected profit per widget:\n\n$E[P(X)] = P(X \\leq 14) * E[P(X) | X \\leq 14] + P(X > 14) * E[P(X) | X > 14]$\n\n$E[P(X)] = 0.9772 * (17 - 10) + 0.0228 * (15 - 14)$\n\n$E[P(X)] = 0.9772 * 7 + 0.0228 * 1$\n\n$E[P(X)] = 6.8404 + 0.0228$\n\n$E[P(X)] = 6.8632$\n\nSince the demand for widgets is high enough that the company can sell as many widgets as it produces, the expected profit will increase linearly with the number of widgets produced. Therefore, there is no upper bound on the optimal value of $n$ that maximizes the expected profit. The more widgets the company produces, the higher the expected profit will be. \n\nTo find the expected profit for a given value of $n$, simply multiply the expected profit per widget by the number of widgets produced:\n\n$E[\\text{Total Profit}] = n * E[P(X)]$\n\nFor example, if the company produces $1000$ widgets, the expected profit would be:\n\n$E[\\text{Total Profit}] = 1000 * 6.8632 = 6863.2$ dollars."
