The rod is initially at room temperature of $20$ degrees Celsius. The ends of the rod are insulated, so there is no heat flow across the boundary. Find the temperature distribution at time $t = 0.1$ seconds, if the thermal diffusivity of the metal is $k = 0.2 \\text{ cm}^2/\\text{s}$.",
    "message_2": "To find the temperature distribution at time $t = 0.1$ seconds, we simply need to plug in the given values of $t$ and $k$ into the equation for $u(x, t)$:\n\n$$u(x, 0.1) = 100\\cos{(\\frac{\\pi x}{10})}\\cdot e^{-0.2 \\cdot 0.1}$$\n\nSimplify the exponential term:\n\n$$u(x, 0.1) = 100\\cos{(\\frac{\\pi x}{10})}\\cdot e^{-0.02}$$\n\nNow, we have the temperature distribution at time $t = 0.1$ seconds:\n\n$$u(x, 0.1) = 100\\cos{(\\frac{\\pi x}{10})}\\cdot e^{-0.02}$$\n\nThis equation gives the temperature at any position $x$ along the rod at time $t = 0.1$ seconds."
