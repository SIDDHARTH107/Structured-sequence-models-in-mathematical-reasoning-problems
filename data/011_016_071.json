    "message_1": "Consider a combinatorial design with parameters (9, 3, 2). This means we have a set of 9 elements and subsets of size 3, and each of the subsets occurs in exactly 2 larger sets. How many 3-element subsets are there in total in this design?",
    "message_2": "Let's denote the total number of 3-element subsets as S. Since each 3-element subset occurs in exactly 2 larger sets, we can say that the total number of pairs of larger sets containing these 3-element subsets is also S.\n\nNow, let's consider the total number of ways to choose 3 elements from the 9-element set. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3!6!) = 84\n\nSo there are 84 possible 3-element subsets from the 9-element set.\n\nNow, let's consider the total number of ways to choose 2 larger sets containing these 3-element subsets. Since each 3-element subset occurs in exactly 2 larger sets, we can say that the total number of pairs of larger sets containing these 3-element subsets is S.\n\nLet's denote the total number of larger sets as L. Then, the total number of pairs of larger sets containing these 3-element subsets can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(L, 2) = L! / (2!(L-2)!)\n\nSince C(L, 2) = S, we have:\n\nL! / (2!(L-2)!) = S\n\nNow, we need to find the value of L that satisfies this equation. We know that S = 84, so we can try different values of L to see which one works.\n\nAfter trying different values, we find that L = 6 satisfies the equation:\n\n6! / (2!4!) = 84\n\nSo there are 6 larger sets in the combinatorial design.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of 3-element subsets in the design. Since each 3-element subset occurs in exactly 2 larger sets, and there are 6 larger sets in total, we can say that the total number of 3-element subsets is:\n\nS = 6 * 2 = 12\n\nSo there are 12 3-element subsets in total in this combinatorial design."
