    "message_1": "A trapezium has a height of 6 cm and two parallel sides of 8 cm and 12 cm. What is the perimeter of the trapezium?",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the length of the other two sides. Let's call the length of the two non-parallel sides a and b.\n\nWe can form two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular line from one of the vertices of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side. The height of the trapezium will be the height of these right triangles, and the difference in length between the parallel sides will be divided between the bases of these right triangles.\n\nThe difference in length between the parallel sides is 12 cm - 8 cm = 4 cm. So, each right triangle will have a base of 2 cm (since the difference is divided equally between the two triangles).\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other two sides (a and b) of the trapezium.\n\na^2 = 6^2 + 2^2\na^2 = 36 + 4\na^2 = 40\na = √40\n\nSince the trapezium is symmetrical, both non-parallel sides (a and b) will have the same length:\n\nb = a = √40\n\nNow, we can find the perimeter of the trapezium by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = 8 cm + 12 cm + a + b\nPerimeter = 8 cm + 12 cm + √40 + √40\nPerimeter = 20 cm + 2√40\n\nSo, the perimeter of the trapezium is 20 cm + 2√40."
