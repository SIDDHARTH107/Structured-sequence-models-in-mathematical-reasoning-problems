    "message_2": "To demonstrate that (A △ B) △ C is not equal to A △ (B △ C), we first need to find the symmetric difference between the sets and then compare the results.\n\nRecall that the symmetric difference between two sets A and B, denoted by A △ B, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. In other words, A △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B).\n\nFirst, let's find A △ B:\nA △ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 3, 4}) - ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 3, 4})\nA △ B = ({1, 2, 3, 4}) - ({2, 3}) = {1, 4}\n\nNow let's find (A △ B) △ C:\n(A △ B) △ C = ({1, 4} △ {3, 4, 5}) = ({1, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5}) - ({1, 4} ∩ {3, 4, 5})\n(A △ B) △ C = ({1, 3, 4, 5}) - ({4}) = {1, 3, 5}\n\nNext, let's find B △ C:\nB △ C = (B ∪ C) - (B ∩ C) = ({2, 3, 4} ∪ {3, 4, 5}) - ({2, 3, 4} ∩ {3, 4, 5})\nB △ C = ({2, 3, 4, 5}) - ({3, 4}) = {2, 5}\n\nNow let's find A △ (B △ C):\nA △ (B △ C) = ({1, 2, 3} △ {2, 5}) = ({1, 2, 3} ∪ {2, 5}) - ({1, 2, 3} ∩ {2, 5})\nA △ (B △ C) = ({1, 2, 3, 5}) - ({2}) = {1, 3, 5}\n\nComparing the results, we see that:\n(A △ B) △ C = {1, 3, 5}\nA △ (B △ C) = {1, 3, 5}\n\nIn this case, (A △ B) △ C is equal to A △ (B △ C). Both sets contain the same elements {1, 3, 5}."
