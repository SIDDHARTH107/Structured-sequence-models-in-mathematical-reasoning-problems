    "message_2": "The Koch snowflake is a fractal that is formed by starting with an equilateral triangle and then recursively adding smaller equilateral triangles to its sides. After each iteration, the number of sides of the snowflake increases by a factor of 4, and the length of each side is reduced to 1/3 of its previous length.\n\nAfter the 4th iteration, the number of sides is 3 * 4^4 = 3 * 256 = 768, and the length of each side is 5 * (1/3)^4 = 5 * (1/81) = 5/81 cm.\n\nThe perimeter of the Koch snowflake after the 4th iteration is the product of the number of sides and the length of each side:\n\nPerimeter = 768 * (5/81) = 3840/81 â‰ˆ 47.41 cm."
