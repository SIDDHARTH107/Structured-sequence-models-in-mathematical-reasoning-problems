    "message_1": "A manufacturing process produces 5000 units of a particular product. The probability of a certain type of defect occurring in a unit is 0.02. What is the probability that exactly 100 units will have this defect?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(X = k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (defective units in this case) in n trials (total units produced)\n- nCk (read as \"n choose k\") is the number of combinations of choosing k successes from n trials, calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (defect occurring) in a single trial\n- 1-p is the probability of failure (no defect occurring) in a single trial\n- n is the total number of trials (units produced)\n- k is the number of successes (defective units) we want to find the probability for\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n- n = 5000 (total units produced)\n- k = 100 (defective units)\n- p = 0.02 (probability of a defect occurring in a unit)\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = 100) = (5000C100) * (0.02^100) * (0.98^4900)\n\nFirst, let's calculate 5000C100:\n\n5000C100 = 5000! / (100! * 4900!)\n= 2.031759e+134 / (9.332622e+157 * 1.929713e+126)\n= 2.031759e+134 / (1.801713e+284)\n= 1.127271e-150\n\nNow, let's calculate 0.02^100 and 0.98^4900:\n\n0.02^100 = 1.267651e-70\n0.98^4900 = 2.372472e-44\n\nFinally, let's plug these values back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 100) = 1.127271e-150 * 1.267651e-70 * 2.372472e-44\n= 3.394e-264\n\nThe probability that exactly 100 units will have this defect is approximately 3.394e-264, which is an extremely small probability."
