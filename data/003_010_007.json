    "message_1": "A flagpole is located on top of a building. If the angle of elevation from the ground to the top of the flagpole is 47 degrees and the distance from the bottom of the building to the flagpole is 60 feet, what is the height of the flagpole?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function in trigonometry. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, we have the angle of elevation (47 degrees) and the distance from the bottom of the building to the flagpole (60 feet). We want to find the height of the flagpole, which is the length of the side opposite the angle.\n\nLet h be the height of the flagpole. We can set up the equation:\n\ntan(47°) = h / 60\n\nNow, we can solve for h:\n\nh = 60 * tan(47°)\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\nh ≈ 60 * 1.0724\nh ≈ 64.34 feet\n\nThe height of the flagpole is approximately 64.34 feet."
