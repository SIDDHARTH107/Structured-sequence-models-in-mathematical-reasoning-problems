    "message_1": "A company has a budget of $50,000 for advertising. The cost of advertising on TV is $5,000 per commercial and on radio is $2,000 per commercial. The company wants to maximize their advertising outreach by using both TV and radio commercials. However, they need to ensure that they don't exceed their budget of $50,000. What is the optimal number of TV commercials and radio commercials the company should run to maximize their outreach while staying within their budget?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of TV commercials and y be the number of radio commercials. The company's budget constraint can be represented by the following equation:\n\n5,000x + 2,000y ≤ 50,000\n\nTo maximize their outreach, the company should try to spend as much of their budget as possible. We can rearrange the equation to make y the subject:\n\ny ≤ (50,000 - 5,000x) / 2,000\n\nSince x and y must be whole numbers (you can't have a fraction of a commercial), we can use trial and error to find the optimal combination of TV and radio commercials:\n\n1. If x = 0 (no TV commercials), y = 25 (all radio commercials).\n2. If x = 1, y = 22.5 (not a whole number, so not a valid option).\n3. If x = 2, y = 20.\n4. If x = 3, y = 17.5 (not a whole number, so not a valid option).\n5. If x = 4, y = 15.\n6. If x = 5, y = 12.5 (not a whole number, so not a valid option).\n7. If x = 6, y = 10.\n8. If x = 7, y = 7.5 (not a whole number, so not a valid option).\n9. If x = 8, y = 5.\n10. If x = 9, y = 2.5 (not a whole number, so not a valid option).\n11. If x = 10, y = 0 (no radio commercials).\n\nThe optimal combination of TV and radio commercials to maximize outreach while staying within the budget is 6 TV commercials and 10 radio commercials. This will cost the company $30,000 for TV commercials (6 * $5,000) and $20,000 for radio commercials (10 * $2,000), for a total of $50,000, which is exactly their budget."
