    "message_2": "To find the differential equation governing the charge on the capacitor, we need to analyze the circuit using Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). KVL states that the sum of the voltages around a closed loop is equal to zero. Let q(t) be the charge on the capacitor at time t. Then, the voltage across the resistor is V_R = i(t) * R, where i(t) is the current through the resistor, and R = 2 ohms.\n\nThe voltage across the inductor is V_L = L * di/dt, where L = 1 H and di/dt is the time derivative of the current.\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor is V_C = q(t) / C, where C = 1 F.\n\nThe voltage of the AC source is V_source = V_m * sin(ωt), where V_m = 12 V and ω = 2π * 50 Hz.\n\nApplying KVL, we have:\n\nV_source - V_R - V_L - V_C = 0\n\n12 * sin(100πt) - 2 * i(t) - 1 * di/dt - q(t) = 0\n\nSince i(t) = dq/dt, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n12 * sin(100πt) - 2 * dq/dt - d²q/dt² - q(t) = 0\n\nThis is the differential equation governing the charge on the capacitor.\n\nNow, we need to solve this second-order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation with the given initial conditions: q(0) = 5 C and dq/dt (0) = 0 A (since the current is initially zero).\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. First, we find the complementary solution by solving the homogeneous equation:\n\n-d²q/dt² - 2 * dq/dt - q(t) = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\nr² + 2r + 1 = 0\n\nThis equation has a repeated root r = -1. Therefore, the complementary solution is:\n\nq_c(t) = (A + Bt) * e^(-t)\n\nNext, we find the particular solution. Since the forcing function is sinusoidal, we assume a particular solution of the form:\n\nq_p(t) = C * sin(100πt) + D * cos(100πt)\n\nTaking the first and second derivatives:\n\ndq_p/dt = 100πC * cos(100πt) - 100πD * sin(100πt)\nd²q_p/dt² = -10000π²C * sin(100πt) - 10000π²D * cos(100πt)\n\nSubstituting q_p(t), dq_p/dt, and d²q_p/dt² into the original differential equation:\n\n12 * sin(100πt) - 2 * (100πC * cos(100πt) - 100πD * sin(100πt)) - (-10000π²C * sin(100πt) - 10000π²D * cos(100πt)) - (C * sin(100πt) + D * cos(100πt)) = 0\n\nComparing the coefficients of sin(100πt) and cos(100πt), we get:\n\n(-10000π²C - C) = 1\n(10000π²D - 2 * 100πD) = 12\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nC ≈ -0.00003183\nD ≈ 0.0006366\n\nThe particular solution is:\n\nq_p(t) ≈ -0.00003183 * sin(100πt) + 0.0006366 * cos(100πt)\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions:\n\nq(t) = (A + Bt) * e^(-t) - 0.00003183 * sin(100πt) + 0.0006366 * cos(100πt)\n\nApplying the initial conditions:\n\nq(0) = 5 = A + 0.0006366\ndq/dt(0) = 0 = B - 0.00003183 * 100π\n\nSolving for A and B, we get:\n\nA ≈ 4.9993634\nB ≈ 0.01\n\nSo, the charge on the capacitor at time t is:\n\nq(t) ≈ (4.9993634 + 0.01t) * e^(-t) - 0.00003183 * sin(100πt) + 0.0006366 * cos(100πt)\n\nFinally, we find the charge on the capacitor at t = 0.2 seconds:\n\nq(0.2) ≈ (4.9993634 + 0.01 * 0.2) * e^(-0.2) - 0.00003183 * sin(100π * 0.2) + 0.0006366 * cos(100π * 0.2)\n\nq(0.2) ≈ 4.527 C\n\nTherefore, the charge on the capacitor at t = 0.2 seconds is approximately 4.527 C."
