    "message_2": "To find a generator for H, we need to find an element in H that can generate all other elements in H by taking its powers. Let's examine the elements of H:\n\n1. a^2: (a^2)^2 = a^4, (a^2)^3 = a^6, (a^2)^4 = a^8, (a^2)^5 = a^10 = e (since G has order 10). So, a^2 generates all elements of H.\n\nNow, let's show that H is a cyclic group. A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. Since we have shown that a^2 generates all elements of H, H is a cyclic group with generator a^2.\n\nIn conclusion, H is a cyclic group with generator a^2."
