Player A can choose between two strategies: strategy 1 or strategy 2, while player B can choose between three strategies: strategy A, B or C. The game payout matrix is as follows:\n\n|        | B:A | B:B | B:C |\n|--------|----|----|----|\n| A:1 | -2 | 4 | 1 |\n| A:2 | 3 | -1 | 5 |\n\nIf player A selects strategy 2, what should player B select to maximize their payout?",
    "message_2": "If player A selects strategy 2, we can look at the payouts for player B in the second row of the matrix:\n\n|        | B:A | B:B | B:C |\n|--------|----|----|----|\n| A:2 | 3 | -1 | 5 |\n\nTo maximize their payout, player B should select the strategy with the lowest value, since the values in the matrix represent the payouts for player A and player B wants to minimize player A's payout. In this case, player B should select strategy B, as it has the lowest value (-1) when player A selects strategy 2."
