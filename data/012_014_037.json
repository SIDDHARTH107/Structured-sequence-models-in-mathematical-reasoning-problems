    "message_2": "To determine if the graphs G and H are isomorphic, we need to find a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices such that the adjacency relationship is preserved.\n\nLet's list the degrees of the vertices in both graphs:\n\nGraph G:\n- Degree of vertex a: 2 (connected to b and c)\n- Degree of vertex b: 2 (connected to a and d)\n- Degree of vertex c: 2 (connected to a and d)\n- Degree of vertex d: 2 (connected to b and c)\n\nGraph H:\n- Degree of vertex p: 2 (connected to q and s)\n- Degree of vertex q: 2 (connected to p and r)\n- Degree of vertex r: 2 (connected to q and s)\n- Degree of vertex s: 2 (connected to p and r)\n\nSince the degrees of the vertices in both graphs are the same, we can try to establish a correspondence between the vertices:\n\n- a ↔ p\n- b ↔ q\n- c ↔ s\n- d ↔ r\n\nNow let's check if the adjacency relationship is preserved:\n\n- In G, a is adjacent to b and c. In H, p is adjacent to q and s. The correspondence holds.\n- In G, b is adjacent to a and d. In H, q is adjacent to p and r. The correspondence holds.\n- In G, c is adjacent to a and d. In H, s is adjacent to p and r. The correspondence holds.\n- In G, d is adjacent to b and c. In H, r is adjacent to q and s. The correspondence holds.\n\nSince the correspondence holds for all vertices and their adjacency relationships, we can conclude that the graphs G and H are isomorphic."
