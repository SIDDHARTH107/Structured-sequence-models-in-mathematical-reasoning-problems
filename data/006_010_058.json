    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (in this case, people affected by the disease) in n trials (in this case, 500 individuals)\n- n choose k is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, which can be calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (in this case, the prevalence of the disease, 20% or 0.2)\n- k is the number of successes we want to find the probability for (in this case, 100 people affected by the disease)\n- n is the total number of trials (in this case, 500 individuals)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(X = 100) = (500 choose 100) * 0.2^100 * (1-0.2)^(500-100)\n\nFirst, we calculate 500 choose 100:\n\n(500 choose 100) = 500! / (100!(500-100)!) = 500! / (100!400!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability:\n\nP(X = 100) = (500! / (100!400!)) * 0.2^100 * 0.8^400\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the values:\n\nP(X = 100) â‰ˆ 0.0103\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 100 people out of a randomly selected group of 500 individuals are affected by the disease is approximately 1.03%."
