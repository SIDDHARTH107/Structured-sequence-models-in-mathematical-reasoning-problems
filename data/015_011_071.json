    "message_1": "What is the minimum initial angle (in degrees) that must be set for both links of a double pendulum with lengths L1 = 1 m and L2 = 0.5 m to exhibit chaotic behavior, assuming the initial angular velocity is zero?",
    "message_2": "There is no specific minimum initial angle that guarantees chaotic behavior in a double pendulum system. Chaotic behavior in a double pendulum is highly sensitive to initial conditions, and even small changes in the initial angles can lead to drastically different outcomes. However, it is generally observed that larger initial angles tend to increase the likelihood of chaotic behavior.\n\nIt is important to note that the double pendulum system is a classical example of a chaotic system, and predicting its behavior becomes increasingly difficult as time progresses. The best approach to study the behavior of a double pendulum is through numerical simulations and experiments."
