    "message_2": "The quotient rule states that if you have a function f(x) = g(x) / h(x), then the derivative f'(x) is given by:\n\nf'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\n\nIn this case, we have g(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2 and h(x) = x - 1. First, we need to find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x) with respect to x:\n\ng'(x) = d(3x^2 - 5x + 2)/dx = 6x - 5\nh'(x) = d(x - 1)/dx = 1\n\nNow we can apply the quotient rule:\n\nf'(x) = ((6x - 5)(x - 1) - (3x^2 - 5x + 2)(1)) / (x - 1)^2\n\nNow, we need to find the derivative at x = 2:\n\nf'(2) = ((6(2) - 5)(2 - 1) - (3(2)^2 - 5(2) + 2)(1)) / (2 - 1)^2\nf'(2) = ((12 - 5)(1) - (12 - 10 + 2)(1)) / (1)^2\nf'(2) = (7 - 4) / 1\nf'(2) = 3\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = (3x^2 - 5x + 2)/(x - 1) at x = 2 is 3."
