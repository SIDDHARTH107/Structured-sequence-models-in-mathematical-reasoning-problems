    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle opposite the side with length 4. Let's denote the angle opposite the side with length 4 as θ, and the other two sides as a and b, with lengths 3 and 3 respectively. The side with length 4 will be denoted as c.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\n\nc² = a² + b² - 2ab * cos(θ)\n\nWe can plug in the values of a, b, and c:\n\n4² = 3² + 3² - 2 * 3 * 3 * cos(θ)\n\n16 = 9 + 9 - 18 * cos(θ)\n\nNow, we can solve for cos(θ):\n\n16 - 18 = -18 * cos(θ)\n\n-2 = -18 * cos(θ)\n\ncos(θ) = 2/18 = 1/9\n\nNow, we can use the inverse cosine function (also known as arccos or cos^(-1)) to find the angle θ:\n\nθ = arccos(1/9)\n\nθ ≈ 83.62°"
