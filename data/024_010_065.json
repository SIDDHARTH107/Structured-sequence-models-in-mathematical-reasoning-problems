    "message_2": "To find the Levi-Civita connection of the given metric g, we first need to compute the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols are given by the following formula:\n\nΓᵏᵢⱼ = (1/2) * gᵏˡ * (∂ᵢgⱼˡ + ∂ⱼgᵢˡ - ∂ˡgᵢⱼ)\n\nwhere Γᵏᵢⱼ are the Christoffel symbols, gᵏˡ is the inverse metric tensor, and ∂ᵢ, ∂ⱼ, and ∂ˡ are partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates xᵢ, xⱼ, and xˡ, respectively.\n\nFor the given metric g = dx^2 + 2dy^2 + dz^2, the metric tensor G is a diagonal matrix with elements Gᵢⱼ = diag(1, 2, 1). The inverse metric tensor is also a diagonal matrix with elements gᵏˡ = diag(1, 1/2, 1).\n\nNow, we can compute the Christoffel symbols. Since the metric tensor G is diagonal and constant, all its partial derivatives are zero:\n\n∂ᵢGⱼˡ = ∂ⱼGᵢˡ = ∂ˡGᵢⱼ = 0\n\nThus, all the Christoffel symbols are also zero:\n\nΓᵏᵢⱼ = (1/2) * gᵏˡ * (∂ᵢGⱼˡ + ∂ⱼGᵢˡ - ∂ˡGᵢⱼ) = 0\n\nSince the Christoffel symbols are zero, the Levi-Civita connection is also zero at any point in R^3, including the point (1, 0, 2)."
