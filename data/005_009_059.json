    "message_1": "Here's a possible question on non-parametric statistics:\n\n\"Suppose you want to compare the median scores of two groups of students, A and B, on a standardized test. However, the scores are not normally distributed, and you cannot assume equal variances between the groups. Perform a Wilcoxon rank-sum test at the 5% significance level to test the hypothesis that the median score of group A is greater than the median score of group B. The scores for group A are: 74, 67, 81, 60, 77, 65, and 70, while the scores for group B are: 80, 71, 76, 68, 73, 64, and 79.\"",
    "message_2": "To perform the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, follow these steps:\n\n1. Combine the scores from both groups and rank them in ascending order. In case of ties, assign the average rank.\n\nCombined scores: 60, 64, 65, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81\nRanks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\n\n2. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each group.\n\nGroup A ranks: 1 (60), 3 (65), 4 (67), 6 (70), 9 (74), 11 (77), 14 (81)\nSum of ranks for group A: 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 11 + 14 = 48\n\nGroup B ranks: 2 (64), 5 (68), 7 (71), 8 (73), 10 (76), 12 (79), 13 (80)\nSum of ranks for group B: 2 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 57\n\n3. Calculate the expected mean rank and standard deviation for group A.\n\nn_A = 7 (number of observations in group A)\nn_B = 7 (number of observations in group B)\n\nExpected mean rank for group A: E(R_A) = n_A * (n_A + n_B + 1) / 2 = 7 * (7 + 7 + 1) / 2 = 7 * 15 / 2 = 52.5\n\nStandard deviation for group A: SD(R_A) = sqrt(n_A * n_B * (n_A + n_B + 1) / 12) = sqrt(7 * 7 * 15 / 12) = sqrt(24.5) ≈ 4.95\n\n4. Calculate the z-score for the sum of ranks in group A.\n\nz = (R_A - E(R_A)) / SD(R_A) = (48 - 52.5) / 4.95 ≈ -0.91\n\n5. Determine the critical z-value for a one-tailed test at the 5% significance level.\n\nFor a one-tailed test at the 5% significance level, the critical z-value is 1.645.\n\n6. Compare the calculated z-score to the critical z-value.\n\nSince the calculated z-score (-0.91) is less than the critical z-value (1.645), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to support the claim that the median score of group A is greater than the median score of group B at the 5% significance level."
