They have 5 items with them, each with a weight and value in USD as follows: \n\nItem 1: 2 kg, $20 \nItem 2: 4 kg, $30 \nItem 3: 6 kg, $40 \nItem 4: 3 kg, $25 \nItem 5: 5 kg, $35 \n\nWhat is the maximum value that the student can carry in their backpack?",
    "message_2": "To find the maximum value that the student can carry in their backpack, we need to determine the combination of items that gives the highest value without exceeding the 10 kg weight limit.\n\nLet's consider the value-to-weight ratio for each item:\n\nItem 1: $20 / 2 kg = $10/kg\nItem 2: $30 / 4 kg = $7.50/kg\nItem 3: $40 / 6 kg = $6.67/kg\nItem 4: $25 / 3 kg = $8.33/kg\nItem 5: $35 / 5 kg = $7/kg\n\nNow, let's try to find the combination of items that maximizes the value while staying within the weight limit:\n\n1. Item 1 + Item 4: 2 kg + 3 kg = 5 kg, $20 + $25 = $45\n2. Item 1 + Item 5: 2 kg + 5 kg = 7 kg, $20 + $35 = $55\n3. Item 2 + Item 4: 4 kg + 3 kg = 7 kg, $30 + $25 = $55\n4. Item 1 + Item 2: 2 kg + 4 kg = 6 kg, $20 + $30 = $50\n5. Item 1 + Item 3: 2 kg + 6 kg = 8 kg, $20 + $40 = $60 (exceeds weight limit)\n6. Item 2 + Item 5: 4 kg + 5 kg = 9 kg, $30 + $35 = $65\n7. Item 3 + Item 4: 6 kg + 3 kg = 9 kg, $40 + $25 = $65 (exceeds weight limit)\n8. Item 1 + Item 2 + Item 4: 2 kg + 4 kg + 3 kg = 9 kg, $20 + $30 + $25 = $75 (exceeds weight limit)\n\nFrom the combinations above, the maximum value that the student can carry in their backpack without exceeding the 10 kg weight limit is $65, which can be achieved by either carrying Item 2 and Item 5 or Item 3 and Item 4."
