If one side of the plate is exposed to 20°C and the other side is insulated, determine the temperature distribution in the plate after 10 minutes using Fourier Transform. The thermal diffusivity of the metal plate is 0.5 cm²/min.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the one-dimensional heat conduction equation with the Fourier Transform method. The heat conduction equation is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position in the plate, and α is the thermal diffusivity.\n\nThe initial condition is T(x,0) = 100°C for 0 < x < 8 cm. The boundary conditions are T(0,t) = 20°C (exposed side) and ∂T/∂x(8,t) = 0 (insulated side).\n\nWe will use the Fourier Transform method to solve this problem. First, we apply the Fourier Transform to the heat conduction equation:\n\n∂T̂/∂t = α k²T̂\n\nwhere T̂ is the Fourier Transform of T and k is the wave number. This equation can be solved by separation of variables:\n\nT̂(k,t) = T̂(k,0) * exp(-α k²t)\n\nNow, we need to find the Fourier Transform of the initial condition T(x,0) = 100°C:\n\nT̂(k,0) = ∫[100 * exp(-ikx)] dx from 0 to 8\n\nTo find the inverse Fourier Transform, we can use the following formula:\n\nT(x,t) = (1/2π) * ∫[T̂(k,t) * exp(ikx)] dk from -∞ to ∞\n\nAfter substituting T̂(k,t) and simplifying, we get:\n\nT(x,t) = 100 + (20/π) * ∑[(-1)^n * exp(-α (2n+1)²π²t/64) * sin((2n+1)πx/8)] from n=0 to ∞\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values of α = 0.5 cm²/min and t = 10 min:\n\nT(x,10) = 100 + (20/π) * ∑[(-1)^n * exp(-0.5 * (2n+1)²π² * 10/64) * sin((2n+1)πx/8)] from n=0 to ∞\n\nThis equation gives the temperature distribution T(x,10) in the plate after 10 minutes. To find the temperature at a specific position x, we can either evaluate the sum numerically or use an approximation by considering a few terms of the series."
