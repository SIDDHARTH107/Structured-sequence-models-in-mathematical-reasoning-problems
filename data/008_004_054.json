    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using matrix operations, we first write the system in matrix form:\n\n```\n| 1  1 -2 | |x|   |0|\n| 2 -1  1 | |y| = |0|\n| 3  2 -1 | |z|   |0|\n```\n\nNow, we will perform Gaussian elimination to find the row echelon form of the augmented matrix:\n\n```\n| 1  1 -2 | 0\n| 2 -1  1 | 0\n| 3  2 -1 | 0\n```\n\nStep 1: Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row, and 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  1 -2 | 0\n| 0 -3  5 | 0\n| 0 -1  5 | 0\n```\n\nStep 2: Divide the second row by -3:\n\n```\n| 1  1 -2 | 0\n| 0  1 -5/3 | 0\n| 0 -1  5 | 0\n```\n\nStep 3: Add the second row to the third row:\n\n```\n| 1  1 -2 | 0\n| 0  1 -5/3 | 0\n| 0  0  0 | 0\n```\n\nNow we have the row echelon form of the augmented matrix. We can write the system of linear equations corresponding to this matrix:\n\n```\nx + y - 2z = 0\ny - (5/3)z = 0\n0 = 0\n```\n\nThe third equation is always true, so we can ignore it. Now we have two equations with three variables, which means we have infinitely many solutions. To find the general solution, we can express the variables x and y in terms of z:\n\n```\ny = (5/3)z\nx = 2z - y = 2z - (5/3)z = (1/3)z\n```\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\n```\nx = (1/3)z\ny = (5/3)z\nz = z\n```\n\nwhere z can be any real number."
