    "message_2": "To find the area between the two curves over the interval [0, 2], we need to integrate the difference of the two functions over that interval.\n\nThe difference between the two functions is (2x - 3) - x^2. We will integrate this function with respect to x from 0 to 2:\n\nâˆ«(2x - 3 - x^2) dx from 0 to 2\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of the function:\n\nF(x) = (2x^2)/2 - 3x - (x^3)/3 + C\nF(x) = x^2 - 3x - (x^3)/3 + C\n\nNow, we evaluate F(x) at the endpoints of the interval and subtract the results:\n\nF(2) = (2^2) - 3(2) - (2^3)/3 + C\nF(2) = 4 - 6 - (8/3) + C\n\nF(0) = (0^2) - 3(0) - (0^3)/3 + C\nF(0) = 0\n\nArea = F(2) - F(0) = (4 - 6 - 8/3) - 0\nArea = -2 - 8/3\nArea = -6/3 - 8/3\nArea = -14/3\n\nSince the area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\nArea = |-14/3|\nArea = 14/3\n\nSo, the area between the curves y = x^2 and y = 2x - 3 over the interval [0, 2] is 14/3 square units."
