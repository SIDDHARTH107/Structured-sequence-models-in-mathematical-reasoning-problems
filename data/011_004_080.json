    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use combinations. We need to find the number of ways to select 4 balls with at least 2 red balls. We can break this down into three cases:\n\n1. Selecting exactly 2 red balls and 2 non-red balls.\n2. Selecting exactly 3 red balls and 1 non-red ball.\n3. Selecting all 4 red balls.\n\nCase 1: Selecting exactly 2 red balls and 2 non-red balls.\nThere are 7 red balls, so we can choose 2 of them in C(7,2) ways. There are 8 non-red balls (5 blue + 3 green), so we can choose 2 of them in C(8,2) ways. Therefore, there are C(7,2) * C(8,2) ways to select 2 red balls and 2 non-red balls.\n\nCase 2: Selecting exactly 3 red balls and 1 non-red ball.\nThere are 7 red balls, so we can choose 3 of them in C(7,3) ways. There are 8 non-red balls, so we can choose 1 of them in C(8,1) ways. Therefore, there are C(7,3) * C(8,1) ways to select 3 red balls and 1 non-red ball.\n\nCase 3: Selecting all 4 red balls.\nThere are 7 red balls, so we can choose 4 of them in C(7,4) ways.\n\nNow, we add up the number of ways for each case:\n\nTotal ways = C(7,2) * C(8,2) + C(7,3) * C(8,1) + C(7,4)\n\nUsing the formula for combinations, C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!):\n\nTotal ways = (7! / (2!5!)) * (8! / (2!6!)) + (7! / (3!4!)) * (8! / (1!7!)) + (7! / (4!3!))\n\nTotal ways = (21) * (28) + (35) * (8) + (35)\n\nTotal ways = 588 + 280 + 35\n\nTotal ways = 903\n\nSo, there are 903 ways to select 4 balls from the box with at least 2 red balls."
