    "message_2": "To compute the intersection number of Y with itself, we need to consider the self-intersection of Y in the homology class [Y] = 3. The self-intersection number is a homotopy invariant, which means that it does not depend on the particular representative of the homology class but only on the homology class itself.\n\nSince Y is a closed oriented 1-manifold in X, it is a union of disjoint simple closed curves. The homology class [Y] = 3 means that Y is homologous to the sum of three times a simple closed curve, say C, in X. In other words, Y can be represented as the union of three disjoint simple closed curves, each homologous to C.\n\nNow, consider a generic loop in Y. Since Y is the union of three disjoint simple closed curves, a generic loop in Y will be homologous to one of these curves, say C'. The intersection number of Y with itself is then the same as the intersection number of C' with Y.\n\nTo compute the intersection number of C' with Y, we can use the intersection product in homology. The intersection product of two homology classes is defined as the algebraic count of the intersections of their representatives, with signs determined by the orientations of the intersecting submanifolds.\n\nIn our case, we want to compute the intersection product of C' with Y. Since Y is the union of three disjoint simple closed curves, each homologous to C, the intersection product of C' with Y is the sum of the intersection products of C' with each of these curves.\n\nHowever, since C' is homologous to one of these curves, say C, it follows that the intersection product of C' with C is nonzero. Moreover, since C' and C are both simple closed curves, their intersection product is equal to the square of their intersection number, which is a positive integer.\n\nOn the other hand, the intersection product of C' with the other two curves in Y is zero, as they are disjoint from C'. Therefore, the intersection number of Y with itself, which is the intersection product of C' with Y, is equal to the square of the intersection number of C' with C.\n\nSince the intersection number of C' with C is a positive integer, its square is also a positive integer. Therefore, the intersection number of Y with itself is a positive integer."
