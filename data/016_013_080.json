    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of a fractal can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(r)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and r is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Sierpinski carpet, there are N = 8 self-similar pieces, and the scaling factor r = 3 (since each side of the square is divided into 3 equal parts).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) of the Sierpinski carpet is:\n\nD = log(8) / log(3) â‰ˆ 1.8928\n\nThe side length and the number of iterations do not affect the Hausdorff dimension, as it is a property of the fractal itself and not dependent on the specific instance or iteration."
