    "message_1": "I'm sorry, but non-monotonic logic deals with reasoning that can lead to uncertain or inconsistent conclusions, which make it difficult to come up with a numerical problem to solve. However, here's a question related to non-monotonic logic:\n\nSuppose you have a set of rules A that lead to a conclusion X. Later on, you add a new rule B that contradicts A. Can you still conclude X with certainty? Explain your answer using non-monotonic logic.",
    "message_2": "In non-monotonic logic, adding new information or rules can change the conclusions that were previously drawn. This is because non-monotonic logic allows for reasoning with incomplete or uncertain information, and as new information becomes available, it can alter the conclusions.\n\nIn the given scenario, you have a set of rules A that lead to a conclusion X. When you add a new rule B that contradicts A, the certainty of conclusion X is no longer guaranteed. This is because the new rule B introduces new information that conflicts with the existing rules A, and as a result, the reasoning process must be re-evaluated.\n\nIn non-monotonic logic, the conclusions are drawn based on the best available information at the time. When new information is introduced, the conclusions may change to accommodate the new information. In this case, since rule B contradicts A, the certainty of conclusion X is now in question, and further analysis is required to determine whether X still holds true or if a different conclusion should be drawn based on the updated set of rules.\n\nIn summary, with the addition of rule B that contradicts A, you can no longer conclude X with certainty using non-monotonic logic. The reasoning process must be re-evaluated to account for the new information, and the conclusions may change as a result."
