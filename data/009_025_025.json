Using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation for option pricing with stochastic volatility, find the price of a call option with strike price $K=120$ and expiration time of $T=1$ year.",
    "message_2": "To find the price of a call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, we first need to calculate the values of $d_1$ and $d_2$. The Black-Scholes-Merton equation is given by:\n\n$C(S, t) = S_t N(d_1) - Ke^{-r(T-t)} N(d_2)$\n\nwhere $C(S, t)$ is the call option price, $S_t$ is the stock price at time $t$, $K$ is the strike price, $r$ is the risk-free interest rate, $T$ is the expiration time, and $N(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. The values of $d_1$ and $d_2$ are given by:\n\n$d_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T-t}} \\left[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{S_t}{K} \\right) + \\left( r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\right) (T-t) \\right]$\n\n$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T-t}$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n\n$S_0 = 100$, $K = 120$, $T = 1$ year, $\\mu = 0.05$, $\\sigma = 0.3$, and the standard deviation of the Wiener process $dW_t = 0.2$. \n\nAssuming a risk-free interest rate $r = 0.05$ (same as the drift $\\mu$), we can calculate $d_1$ and $d_2$:\n\n$d_1 = \\frac{1}{0.3 \\sqrt{1}} \\left[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{100}{120} \\right) + \\left( 0.05 + \\frac{0.3^2}{2} \\right) (1) \\right] \\approx -0.4306$\n\n$d_2 = -0.4306 - 0.3 \\sqrt{1} \\approx -0.7306$\n\nNow, we can find the price of the call option using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation:\n\n$C(100, 0) = 100 N(-0.4306) - 120e^{-0.05} N(-0.7306) \\approx 100(0.3334) - 120(0.9753)(0.2325) \\approx 33.34 - 27.06 \\approx 6.28$\n\nTherefore, the price of the call option with a strike price of $120$ and an expiration time of $1$ year is approximately $6.28$."
