    "message_1": "Two prisoners, A and B, are held in different cells and are not allowed to communicate with each other. They are each given the choice to either cooperate with each other (C) or betray each other (B). If both prisoners cooperate, they will each receive a sentence of 1 year in prison. If one prisoner betrays the other, the betrayer will go free while the other prisoner receives a sentence of 10 years in prison. If both prisoners betray each other, they will each receive a sentence of 5 years in prison.\n\nAssuming both prisoners are aware of the potential outcomes, what is the Nash equilibrium for this game, and what is the expected outcome for each prisoner?",
    "message_2": "To find the Nash equilibrium, we need to analyze the possible outcomes for each prisoner based on their choices. We can represent the outcomes in a payoff matrix:\n\n```\n          Prisoner B\n          C      B\n        +------+------+\n  C     | -1,-1 | -10,0 |\nPrisoner A      |\n        +------+------+\n  B     | 0,-10 | -5,-5 |\n        +------+------+\n```\n\nHere, the first number in each cell represents the outcome for Prisoner A, and the second number represents the outcome for Prisoner B.\n\nNow, let's find the best response for each prisoner:\n\n- If Prisoner A chooses C, Prisoner B's best response is B, as 0 years in prison is better than 1 year.\n- If Prisoner A chooses B, Prisoner B's best response is also B, as 5 years in prison is better than 10 years.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- If Prisoner B chooses C, Prisoner A's best response is B, as 0 years in prison is better than 1 year.\n- If Prisoner B chooses B, Prisoner A's best response is also B, as 5 years in prison is better than 10 years.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium occurs when both prisoners choose the strategy that is the best response to the other's strategy. In this case, the Nash equilibrium is when both prisoners choose to betray each other (B, B), resulting in each prisoner receiving a sentence of 5 years in prison."
