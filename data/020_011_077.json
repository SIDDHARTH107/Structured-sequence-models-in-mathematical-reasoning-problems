    "message_1": "A company produces two types of products, A and B. The production of one unit of A requires 2 hours of labor and 1 hour of machine time, while the production of one unit of B requires 1 hour of labor and 3 hours of machine time. The selling prices of A and B are $100 and $120, respectively. The company can hire up to 200 hours of labor and use up to 360 hours of machine time per week. Determine the optimal production quantities of each product that maximizes the total revenue.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. We want to maximize the total revenue, which can be represented by the objective function:\n\nRevenue = 100x + 120y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n2x + y ≤ 200 (labor constraint)\nx + 3y ≤ 360 (machine time constraint)\nx ≥ 0\ny ≥ 0\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the graphical method. First, we'll find the feasible region by graphing the constraints:\n\n1. Labor constraint: y ≤ -2x + 200\n2. Machine time constraint: y ≤ -1/3x + 120\n3. x ≥ 0\n4. y ≥ 0\n\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. Now we'll find the vertices of the feasible region:\n\n1. Intersection of labor constraint and x-axis (y = 0): 2x = 200, x = 100\n2. Intersection of labor constraint and machine time constraint: 2x + y = 200, x + 3y = 360\n   Solving this system of equations, we get x = 60 and y = 80\n3. Intersection of machine time constraint and y-axis (x = 0): 3y = 360, y = 120\n\nNow we'll evaluate the objective function (Revenue) at each vertex:\n\n1. Vertex (100, 0): Revenue = 100(100) + 120(0) = $10,000\n2. Vertex (60, 80): Revenue = 100(60) + 120(80) = $16,800\n3. Vertex (0, 120): Revenue = 100(0) + 120(120) = $14,400\n\nThe maximum revenue is $16,800, which occurs when the company produces 60 units of product A and 80 units of product B."
