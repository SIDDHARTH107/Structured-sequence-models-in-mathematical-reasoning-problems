    "message_2": "The girth of a graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. To determine the girth of graph G with 7 vertices and 10 edges, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum number of edges for a tree with 7 vertices: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and it has n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. So, for a tree with 7 vertices, the maximum number of edges is 7 - 1 = 6 edges.\n\n2. Since graph G has 10 edges, which is more than the maximum number of edges for a tree with 7 vertices, we know that G must contain at least one cycle.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the possible cycle lengths in G. The shortest possible cycle in a graph is a triangle, which has a cycle length of 3. If G has a girth of 3, it must contain at least one triangle.\n\n4. To check if G has a girth of 3, we can use the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. In G, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2 * 10 = 20.\n\n5. If G has a girth of 3, it must contain at least one triangle. In this case, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or more. If all vertices have a degree of 2 or less, then G cannot have a girth of 3.\n\n6. Since G has 7 vertices and 10 edges, the average degree of a vertex in G is (2 * 10) / 7 â‰ˆ 2.86. Since the average degree is greater than 2, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 3 or more.\n\n7. Therefore, G has a girth of 3, as it contains at least one triangle."
