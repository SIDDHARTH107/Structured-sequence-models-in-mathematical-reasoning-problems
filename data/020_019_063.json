The variable cost of production is $40 per widget, while the fixed costs of production (such as rent and salaries) are $4,000 per month. The widgets are sold for $80 each. The company wants to maximize their monthly profit. What is the optimal number of widgets that the company should produce and sell per month?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal number of widgets to produce and sell per month, we need to calculate the profit function and then find the maximum profit.\n\nLet x be the number of widgets produced and sold per month.\n\nRevenue (R) = Selling price per widget * Number of widgets sold\nR = 80x\n\nCost (C) = Fixed costs + Variable costs\nC = 4000 + 40x\n\nProfit (P) = Revenue - Cost\nP = R - C\nP = 80x - (4000 + 40x)\nP = 40x - 4000\n\nTo find the maximum profit, we can take the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and set it equal to zero.\n\ndP/dx = 40\n\nSince the derivative is a constant, the profit function is a linear function, and there is no maximum value for the profit. However, we can find the break-even point, where the profit is zero.\n\n0 = 40x - 4000\n4000 = 40x\nx = 100\n\nThe break-even point is when the company produces and sells 100 widgets per month. To maximize their monthly profit, the company should produce and sell more than 100 widgets per month."
