    "message_2": "Let's first understand the problem statement. We have a compact smooth oriented 2-dimensional manifold M embedded in R^4 with genus g = 2. The manifold M intersects a hyperplane in R^4 transversely at exactly 10 points. We want to find the number of homology classes of M that are represented by hypersurfaces in R^4 that intersect M in exactly those 10 points.\n\nWe can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem to solve this problem. The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that if M is a smooth oriented k-dimensional manifold embedded in R^(k+2), and H is a hyperplane in R^(k+2) that intersects M transversely, then the inclusion map i: M ∩ H → M induces an isomorphism on homology groups H_j(M ∩ H) ≅ H_j(M) for j < k - 1 and a surjection for j = k - 1.\n\nIn our case, M is a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in R^4, so k = 2. We have a hyperplane H in R^4 that intersects M transversely at exactly 10 points. By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the inclusion map i: M ∩ H → M induces an isomorphism on homology groups H_j(M ∩ H) ≅ H_j(M) for j < 2 - 1 = 1 and a surjection for j = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nSince M has genus g = 2, we know that its first homology group H_1(M) is isomorphic to Z^4, where Z is the group of integers. The intersection of M and H consists of 10 points, so the first homology group H_1(M ∩ H) is isomorphic to Z^10. By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the inclusion map i: M ∩ H → M induces a surjection on H_1(M ∩ H) ≅ H_1(M).\n\nNow, we want to find the number of homology classes of M that are represented by hypersurfaces in R^4 that intersect M in exactly those 10 points. This is equivalent to finding the number of distinct homology classes in H_1(M) that can be represented by cycles in M ∩ H.\n\nSince the inclusion map i: M ∩ H → M induces a surjection on H_1(M ∩ H) ≅ H_1(M), we know that every homology class in H_1(M) can be represented by a cycle in M ∩ H. Therefore, the number of homology classes of M that are represented by hypersurfaces in R^4 that intersect M in exactly those 10 points is equal to the number of distinct homology classes in H_1(M), which is the rank of H_1(M).\n\nSince H_1(M) is isomorphic to Z^4, the rank of H_1(M) is 4. Therefore, there are 4 homology classes of M that are represented by hypersurfaces in R^4 that intersect M in exactly those 10 points."
