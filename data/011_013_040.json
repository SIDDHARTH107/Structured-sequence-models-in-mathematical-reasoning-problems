    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Polya Enumeration Theorem (PET). First, we need to find the cycle index of the group action on the beads. Since there are 12 beads in total, we will consider the cyclic group $C_{12}$ and the dihedral group $D_{12}$.\n\nThe cycle index of $C_{12}$ is given by:\n\n$P_{C_{12}}(x_1, x_2, ..., x_{12}) = \\frac{1}{12}(x_1^{12} + 2x_2^6 + 3x_3^4 + 4x_4^3 + 6x_6^2 + 12x_{12})$\n\nThe cycle index of $D_{12}$ is given by:\n\n$P_{D_{12}}(x_1, x_2, ..., x_{12}) = \\frac{1}{2}(P_{C_{12}}(x_1, x_2, ..., x_{12}) + \\frac{1}{2}(x_1^6x_2^3 + x_2^6))$\n\nNow, we substitute $x_i = r^i + b^i + g^i$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., 12$, where $r$, $b$, and $g$ represent the number of red, blue, and green beads, respectively. In our case, $r = 6$, $b = 4$, and $g = 2$.\n\nAfter substituting, we get:\n\n$P_{D_{12}}(6, 4, 2) = \\frac{1}{2}(P_{C_{12}}(6, 4, 2) + \\frac{1}{2}((6^6)(4^3) + (4^6)))$\n\nCalculating the values, we get:\n\n$P_{D_{12}}(6, 4, 2) = \\frac{1}{2}(3640 + \\frac{1}{2}(248832 + 4096))$\n\n$P_{D_{12}}(6, 4, 2) = \\frac{1}{2}(3640 + 126464)$\n\n$P_{D_{12}}(6, 4, 2) = \\frac{1}{2}(130104)$\n\n$P_{D_{12}}(6, 4, 2) = 65052$\n\nSo, there are 65,052 distinct bracelets that can be made using 6 red, 4 blue, and 2 green identical beads."
