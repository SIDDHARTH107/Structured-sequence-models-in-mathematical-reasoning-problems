    "message_1": "A factory produces light bulbs, and the rate of defective light bulbs produced by the factory is 5%. A customer randomly selects 10 light bulbs from a pack. What is the probability that the customer receives at least one defective light bulb, according to Bayesian statistics? Assume that the prior probability distribution of the rate of defective light bulbs produced by the factory follows a Beta(2, 38) distribution.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the Bayesian approach. We are given the prior distribution of the rate of defective light bulbs as Beta(2, 38). We want to find the probability that the customer receives at least one defective light bulb, which is the complementary probability of receiving no defective light bulbs.\n\nLet D be the event that the customer receives at least one defective light bulb, and let p be the rate of defective light bulbs. We want to find P(D).\n\nFirst, we find the complementary probability, P(D'):\n\nP(D') = ∫ P(D' | p) * P(p) dp\n\nwhere P(D' | p) is the probability of receiving no defective light bulbs given the rate p, and P(p) is the prior probability distribution of the rate of defective light bulbs.\n\nSince the customer selects 10 light bulbs, the probability of receiving no defective light bulbs given the rate p is (1 - p)^10. The prior probability distribution of the rate of defective light bulbs is given as Beta(2, 38), which has the probability density function:\n\nP(p) = Γ(40) / (Γ(2) * Γ(38)) * p^(2-1) * (1 - p)^(38-1)\n\nNow we can plug these into the integral:\n\nP(D') = ∫ (1 - p)^10 * Γ(40) / (Γ(2) * Γ(38)) * p^(2-1) * (1 - p)^(38-1) dp\nP(D') = Γ(40) / (Γ(2) * Γ(38)) * ∫ p^(1) * (1 - p)^(48-1) dp\n\nSince the integral is in the form of a Beta function, we can rewrite it as:\n\nP(D') = Γ(40) / (Γ(2) * Γ(38)) * Γ(2 + 1) * Γ(48) / Γ(40 + 1)\nP(D') = Γ(40) / (Γ(2) * Γ(38)) * Γ(3) * Γ(48) / Γ(41)\n\nUsing the properties of the gamma function, we know that Γ(n) = (n-1)! for positive integers n. Therefore, we can simplify the expression:\n\nP(D') = (39!)/(1! * 37!) * 2! * 47! / 40!\nP(D') = (39 * 38) / (2 * 40)\nP(D') = 0.7225\n\nNow we can find the probability of receiving at least one defective light bulb, P(D):\n\nP(D) = 1 - P(D')\nP(D) = 1 - 0.7225\nP(D) = 0.2775\n\nSo, the probability that the customer receives at least one defective light bulb is approximately 0.2775 or 27.75%."
