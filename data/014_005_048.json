    "message_1": "Suppose Alice wants to electronically sign a message with a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). She chooses a prime number p=47 and a generator g=5. Her private key is x=8 and her public key is y=g^x (mod p). She then receives a message hash value h=13 and wants to sign it using her private key. What will be the signature for the message?",
    "message_2": "To sign the message using the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), Alice needs to follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute her public key y:\n   y = g^x (mod p)\n   y = 5^8 (mod 47)\n   y = 390625 (mod 47)\n   y = 32\n\n2. Choose a random integer k (1 < k < p-1) that is relatively prime to p-1. For simplicity, let's choose k = 3.\n\n3. Compute r:\n   r = (g^k (mod p)) (mod (p-1))\n   r = (5^3 (mod 47)) (mod 46)\n   r = (125 (mod 47)) (mod 46)\n   r = 34 (mod 46)\n   r = 34\n\n4. Compute s:\n   s = (k^(-1) * (h + x*r)) (mod (p-1))\n   First, we need to find the modular inverse of k (mod (p-1)). In this case, k = 3 and (p-1) = 46.\n   The modular inverse of 3 (mod 46) is 31, since (3 * 31) % 46 = 1.\n\n   Now, we can compute s:\n   s = (31 * (13 + 8 * 34)) (mod 46)\n   s = (31 * (13 + 272)) (mod 46)\n   s = (31 * 285) (mod 46)\n   s = 8835 (mod 46)\n   s = 9\n\nSo, the signature for the message is (r, s) = (34, 9)."
