    "message_2": "To find the chromatic polynomial of this graph, we need to count the number of ways to color the graph using k colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial of the graph G with k colors. We can use the deletion-contraction method to find the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\nLet's consider the edge connecting vertices B and E. We can delete this edge and find the chromatic polynomial of the resulting graph, which we'll call G'. The graph G' looks like this:\n\n```\n    A -- B    C\n    |         |\n    D -- E -- F\n```\n\nNow, we can contract the edge connecting vertices B and E, merging the two vertices into a single vertex, which we'll call BE. The resulting graph, which we'll call G'', looks like this:\n\n```\n    A -- BE -- C\n    |         |\n    D --      F\n```\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of the given graph G can be found using the formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k)\n\nNow we need to find the chromatic polynomials of G' and G''.\n\nFor G', we have:\n\nP(G', k) = k(k-1)^4\n\nFor G'', we have:\n\nP(G'', k) = k(k-1)^3\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula for P(G, k):\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^4 - k(k-1)^3\n\nWe can factor out k(k-1)^3 from the expression:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^3(k-1)\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial of the given graph is:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^4"
