    "message_2": "Proof that H = <𝑏>:\n\nLet 𝑥 be an arbitrary element in H. Since H is a subgroup of G, 𝑥 can be written as 𝑎^k for some integer k. We know that 𝑏 is the smallest positive integer such that 𝑏 ∈ H, so 𝑏 = 𝑎^m for some integer m.\n\nNow, we can use the division algorithm to write k = qm + r, where q and r are integers and 0 ≤ r < m. Then, we have:\n\n𝑎^k = 𝑎^(qm + r) = (𝑎^m)^q * 𝑎^r = 𝑏^q * 𝑎^r.\n\nSince 𝑏 ∈ H and H is a subgroup, 𝑏^q ∈ H. Therefore, 𝑎^k = 𝑏^q * 𝑎^r ∈ H, which implies that 𝑎^r ∈ H. But we know that 0 ≤ r < m, and 𝑏 is the smallest positive integer in H. Thus, r must be 0, and 𝑎^k = 𝑏^q ∈ <𝑏>.\n\nSince 𝑥 was an arbitrary element in H, and we showed that 𝑥 ∈ <𝑏>, we can conclude that H = <𝑏>.\n\nNow, let 𝑛 = 14, and let H be the subgroup of G generated by 𝑎^3. We want to find the elements of H and express it as <𝑏>, where 𝑏 ∈ G.\n\nFirst, we need to find the order of 𝑎^3 in G. The order of 𝑎 is 𝑛 = 14. By Euler's theorem, 𝑎^ϕ(𝑛) ≡ 1 (mod 𝑛), where ϕ is the Euler's totient function. In this case, ϕ(14) = ϕ(2) * ϕ(7) = 1 * 6 = 6. So, 𝑎^6 ≡ 1 (mod 14).\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive integer k such that (𝑎^3)^k ≡ 1 (mod 14). Since 𝑎^6 ≡ 1 (mod 14), we have (𝑎^3)^2 ≡ 1 (mod 14). Thus, the order of 𝑎^3 is 2.\n\nThe subgroup H generated by 𝑎^3 has order 2, so H = {1, 𝑎^3}. In this case, 𝑏 = 𝑎^3, so H = <𝑎^3>."
