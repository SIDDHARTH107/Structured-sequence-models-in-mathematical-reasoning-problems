    "message_2": "To find the total number of possible outfits, we can use the counting principle, which states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another, then there are m * n ways to do both.\n\nIn this case, there are 5 choices for pants, 4 choices for shirts, and 3 choices for shoes. So, the total number of possible outfits is:\n\n5 (pants) * 4 (shirts) * 3 (shoes) = 60 possible outfits."
