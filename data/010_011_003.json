    "message_2": "There are precisely two non-isomorphic compact, connected, smooth 2-dimensional manifolds without boundary: the 2-sphere (S^2) and the 2-torus (T^2).\n\nThis result follows from the classification of compact, connected, smooth 2-dimensional manifolds without boundary, which states that any such manifold is determined by its genus (the number of \"holes\" it has). The genus is a topological invariant, meaning that it is preserved under homeomorphisms (continuous deformations). Two manifolds with different genus cannot be isomorphic.\n\nThe 2-sphere (S^2) has genus 0, as it has no holes. The 2-torus (T^2) has genus 1, as it has one hole. Any other compact, connected, smooth 2-dimensional manifold without boundary must have genus greater than 1, but these manifolds can be obtained by connected sum of multiple tori, and thus are not distinct from the 2-torus in terms of isomorphism classes.\n\nTherefore, there are only two non-isomorphic compact, connected, smooth 2-dimensional manifolds without boundary: the 2-sphere (S^2) and the 2-torus (T^2)."
