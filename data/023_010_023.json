    "message_2": "To calculate the total power of the image in the frequency domain, we first need to apply the 2D Fourier Transform to the image. The 2D Fourier Transform is given by:\n\nF(u, v) = Σ[Σ[f(x, y) * e^(-j2π(ux/M + vy/N))]], where x = 0 to M-1, y = 0 to N-1, u = 0 to M-1, and v = 0 to N-1.\n\nHere, f(x, y) represents the grayscale intensity of the pixel at position (x, y) in the image, M and N are the dimensions of the image (512x512 in this case), and F(u, v) is the frequency domain representation of the image.\n\nOnce we have the frequency domain representation F(u, v), we can calculate the total power of the image in the frequency domain using the Parseval's theorem:\n\nTotal power = Σ[Σ[|F(u, v)|^2]] / (MN), where u = 0 to M-1, and v = 0 to N-1.\n\nIn this case, M = N = 512. To compute the total power, you would need the actual pixel values of the image to perform the Fourier Transform and then apply the Parseval's theorem."
