    "message_2": "To find the critical points of the function $f(x, y)$, we need to compute its gradient and set it equal to the zero vector. The gradient of $f(x, y)$ is given by:\n\n$\\nabla f(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\right)$\n\nComputing the partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 + 3y^2 - 6x + 2$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 6xy - 6y$\n\nNow, we set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for $(x, y)$:\n\n$3x^2 + 3y^2 - 6x + 2 = 0$\n\n$6xy - 6y = 0$\n\nThe second equation can be simplified to $y(6x - 6) = 0$, which gives us two cases:\n\n1) $y = 0$: In this case, the first equation becomes $3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(3x - 2)(x - 1) = 0$. This gives us two critical points: $(\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$ and $(1, 0)$.\n\n2) $x = 1$: In this case, the first equation becomes $3(1)^2 + 3y^2 - 6(1) + 2 = 0$, which simplifies to $3y^2 = 1$. This gives us two critical points: $(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$ and $(1, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the nature of these critical points using the Hessian matrix. The Hessian matrix is given by:\n\n$H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n\nComputing the second partial derivatives, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x - 6$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 6y$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6x - 6$\n\nNow, we evaluate the Hessian matrix at each critical point and compute its determinant:\n\n1) At $(\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$: $H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$. The determinant is $0$, so we cannot determine the nature of this critical point using the Hessian.\n\n2) At $(1, 0)$: $H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$. The determinant is $0$, so we cannot determine the nature of this critical point using the Hessian.\n\n3) At $(1, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$: $H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n2\\sqrt{3} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$. The determinant is $-12$, which is negative, indicating that this critical point is a saddle point.\n\n4) At $(1, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}})$: $H(f) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & -2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n-2\\sqrt{3} & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$. The determinant is $-12$, which is negative, indicating that this critical point is a saddle point.\n\nSince the Hessian test is inconclusive for the first two critical points, we need to analyze the behavior of the function near these points. However, since the domain $D$ is compact, we know that the function must have at least one local minimum and one local maximum. Since we have found two saddle points, the other two critical points must be a local minimum and a local maximum.\n\nThus, there are 2 local extrema of $f$ on the domain $D$."
