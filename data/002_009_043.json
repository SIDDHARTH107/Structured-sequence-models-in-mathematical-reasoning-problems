    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a cylindrical water tank, we need to calculate the area of the two circular bases and the lateral surface area (the area around the curved side).\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.\n\nThe formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is A = 2πrh, where A is the area, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nFirst, let's find the area of one circular base:\nA = π(5^2)\nA = 25π square meters\n\nSince there are two bases, we multiply this by 2:\n2 * 25π = 50π square meters\n\nNow, let's find the lateral surface area:\nA = 2π(5)(10)\nA = 100π square meters\n\nFinally, we add the areas of the two bases and the lateral surface area to find the total surface area:\nTotal Surface Area = 50π + 100π = 150π square meters\n\nTo find the surface area to the nearest square meter, we can approximate π as 3.14:\nTotal Surface Area ≈ 150 * 3.14 = 471 square meters\n\nSo, the surface area of the cylindrical water tank is approximately 471 square meters."
