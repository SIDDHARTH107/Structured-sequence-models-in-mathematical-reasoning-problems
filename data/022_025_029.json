    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use numerical methods since the potential well function is not analytically solvable. We will employ the shooting method and normalization condition to find the ground state wave function and energy.\n\n1. Define the potential function: $V(x) = |x|^3 - 3x$\n\n2. Rewrite the Schrödinger equation as two first-order differential equations:\n\n   $$\\frac{d\\psi}{dx} = \\phi$$\n   $$\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = -\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(E - V(x))\\psi$$\n\n3. Set initial conditions for the ground state: $\\psi(0) = 1$, $\\phi(0) = 0$, and an initial guess for $E_0$.\n\n4. Use a numerical method, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to solve the differential equations for $\\psi(x)$ and $\\phi(x)$ over a range of $x$ values.\n\n5. Check the normalization condition: $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty |\\psi(x)|^2 dx=1$. If the condition is not satisfied, adjust the energy guess $E_0$ and repeat steps 4-5 until the condition is satisfied.\n\n6. Once the normalization condition is satisfied, the corresponding wave function $\\psi_0(x)$ and energy $E_0$ are the ground state wave function and energy.\n\nDue to the numerical nature of this problem, we cannot provide an exact analytical solution for $\\psi_0(x)$ and $E_0$. However, by following the steps above, one can obtain a numerical approximation for the ground state wave function and energy."
