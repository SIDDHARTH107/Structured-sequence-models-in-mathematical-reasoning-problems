    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) at the point where x = 2, we need to find the slope of the tangent line and the coordinates of the point on the curve where x = 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of the point on the curve where x = 2:\n\ny = f(2) = (2)^2 - 3(2) + 5\ny = 4 - 6 + 5\ny = 3\n\nSo the point on the curve is (2, 3).\n\nNext, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at this point. To do this, we'll find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x, which represents the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve:\n\nf'(x) = d/dx (x^2 - 3x + 5)\n\nUsing the power rule and the linearity of the derivative, we get:\n\nf'(x) = 2x - 3\n\nNow, we'll find the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 3) by evaluating f'(2):\n\nf'(2) = 2(2) - 3\nf'(2) = 4 - 3\nf'(2) = 1\n\nSo the slope of the tangent line at the point (2, 3) is 1.\n\nFinally, we'll use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is the point (2, 3) and m is the slope 1:\n\ny - 3 = 1(x - 2)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\ny = x + 1\n\nSo the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) at the point where x = 2 is y = x + 1."
