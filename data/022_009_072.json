    "message_2": "To find the power series representation of the function f(x) = ln(1+x) centered at x = 0, we can use the Taylor series formula:\n\nf(x) = ∑ [f^n(0) / n!] * x^n\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) = ln(1+x) and evaluate them at x = 0.\n\nf(x) = ln(1+x)\nf'(x) = 1/(1+x)\nf''(x) = -1/(1+x)^2\nf'''(x) = 2/(1+x)^3\n...\n\nNotice that the pattern of the derivatives is the following:\n\nf^n(x) = ((-1)^(n-1) * (n-1)!)/(1+x)^n\n\nNow, let's evaluate the derivatives at x = 0:\n\nf^n(0) = ((-1)^(n-1) * (n-1)!)\n\nNow, we can write the power series representation of f(x):\n\nf(x) = ∑ [((-1)^(n-1) * (n-1)!) / n!] * x^n\n\nSimplify the series:\n\nf(x) = ∑ [((-1)^(n-1) * x^n) / n] for n = 1 to infinity\n\nNow, we need to find the radius and interval of convergence. We can use the Ratio Test for this purpose:\n\nlim (n -> infinity) |a_(n+1)/a_n| = lim (n -> infinity) |((-1)^n * x^(n+1)) / (n+1) * n / ((-1)^(n-1) * x^n)|\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\nlim (n -> infinity) |(n * x) / (n+1)|\n\nSince the limit depends on x, we need to find the value of x for which the limit is less than 1:\n\n|(n * x) / (n+1)| < 1\n\nAs n goes to infinity, the expression becomes:\n\n| x | < 1\n\nThis means that the radius of convergence is 1.\n\nNow, we need to check the endpoints of the interval to find the interval of convergence. Let's check x = -1 and x = 1.\n\nFor x = -1:\n\nf(-1) = ∑ [((-1)^(n-1) * (-1)^n) / n] = ∑ [((-1)^n) / n]\n\nThis series is the alternating harmonic series, which is convergent.\n\nFor x = 1:\n\nf(1) = ∑ [((-1)^(n-1) * 1^n) / n] = ∑ [((-1)^(n-1)) / n]\n\nThis series is the harmonic series with alternating signs, which is also convergent.\n\nTherefore, the interval of convergence is [-1, 1].\n\nIn conclusion, the radius of convergence is 1, and the interval of convergence is [-1, 1]."
