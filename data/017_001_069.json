    "message_2": "To prove that the group {1, i, -1, -i} under multiplication is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C4 or the Klein four-group V4, we need to show that it has the same structure as one of these groups.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cyclic group C4. The cyclic group C4 has four elements and is generated by a single element, say g, such that g^4 = 1. The elements of C4 are {1, g, g^2, g^3}. Let's see if we can find a generator for the group {1, i, -1, -i}.\n\nWe know that i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, and i^4 = 1. Thus, the group {1, i, -1, -i} can be generated by the single element i, and its elements can be represented as {1, i, i^2, i^3}. This shows that the group {1, i, -1, -i} has the same structure as the cyclic group C4.\n\nNow let's consider the Klein four-group V4. The Klein four-group V4 has four elements, and it is the direct product of two copies of the cyclic group of order 2, i.e., V4 = C2 Ã— C2. The elements of V4 can be represented as {(1,1), (1,g), (g,1), (g,g)}, where g^2 = 1.\n\nTo show that the group {1, i, -1, -i} is not isomorphic to the Klein four-group V4, we need to show that it cannot be represented as a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2. Notice that in the group {1, i, -1, -i}, the element i has order 4, as i^4 = 1. However, in the Klein four-group V4, all non-identity elements have order 2. This means that the group {1, i, -1, -i} cannot be represented as a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the group {1, i, -1, -i} under multiplication is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4, but not to the Klein four-group V4."
