    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces two products (product A and product B) in a single factory. The production of product A requires 3 hours of machine time and 2 hours of assembly time, while the production of product B requires 2 hours of machine time and 4 hours of assembly time. The company has 40 hours of machine time and 32 hours of assembly time available per day. Each unit of product A makes a profit of $50, and each unit of product B makes a profit of $60. Determine the optimal production levels of product A and product B that will yield the maximum profit for the company.",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of product A produced and y be the number of units of product B produced. We want to maximize the profit function P(x, y) = 50x + 60y, subject to the constraints of machine time and assembly time.\n\nThe constraints are:\n3x + 2y ≤ 40 (machine time)\n2x + 4y ≤ 32 (assembly time)\n\nFirst, let's solve the constraints for y:\ny ≤ (40 - 3x) / 2\ny ≤ (32 - 2x) / 4\n\nNow, we will find the feasible region by graphing the inequalities and finding the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nThe feasible region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0, 0), (0, 8), (8, 6), and (13.333, 0). We will now evaluate the profit function at each of these vertices:\n\nP(0, 0) = 50(0) + 60(0) = $0\nP(0, 8) = 50(0) + 60(8) = $480\nP(8, 6) = 50(8) + 60(6) = $760\nP(13.333, 0) = 50(13.333) + 60(0) = $666.65 (approximately)\n\nThe maximum profit occurs at the vertex (8, 6), where the company produces 8 units of product A and 6 units of product B. This yields a maximum profit of $760."
