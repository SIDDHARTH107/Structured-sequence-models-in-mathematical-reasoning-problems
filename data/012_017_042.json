    "message_2": "A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all vertices such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. In other words, each vertex is paired with exactly one other vertex.\n\nLet's analyze the graph G:\n\nVertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nEdges: {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6)}\n\nWe can visualize the graph as follows:\n\n1 -- 2\n| \\/ |\n| /\\ |\n3 -- 4 -- 5 -- 6\n\nNow, let's find the perfect matchings:\n\n1. (1,2), (3,4), (5,6)\n2. (1,3), (2,3), (4,5), (5,6)\n\nThere are 2 perfect matchings in the graph G."
