The table below shows the production quantities and their respective costs in thousands of dollars.\n\n| Product | Production Quantity | Production Cost |\n|---------|---------------------|-----------------|\n|   A     |         500         |        125      |\n|   B     |         750         |        175      |\n|   C     |         1000        |        250      |\n\nUsing principal component analysis, determine the linear combinations of production quantities that result in the maximum variance across the three products.",
    "message_2": "To perform principal component analysis (PCA), we first need to create a data matrix with the given information. In this case, we have two variables: production quantity (Q) and production cost (C). The data matrix X will be:\n\nX = |  500   125  |\n    |  750   175  |\n    | 1000   250  |\n\nNext, we need to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each variable. \n\nMean of Q: (500 + 750 + 1000) / 3 = 750\nMean of C: (125 + 175 + 250) / 3 = 183.33\n\nStandard deviation of Q: sqrt(((500 - 750)^2 + (750 - 750)^2 + (1000 - 750)^2) / 3) = 250\nStandard deviation of C: sqrt(((125 - 183.33)^2 + (175 - 183.33)^2 + (250 - 183.33)^2) / 3) ≈ 62.23\n\nNow, we standardize the data matrix:\n\nX_standardized = | (500 - 750) / 250    (125 - 183.33) / 62.23  |\n                 | (750 - 750) / 250    (175 - 183.33) / 62.23  |\n                 | (1000 - 750) / 250   (250 - 183.33) / 62.23  |\n\nX_standardized = | -1    -0.937  |\n                 |  0    -0.134  |\n                 |  1     1.071  |\n\nNow, we compute the covariance matrix of the standardized data:\n\nCov(X_standardized) = (1 / (3 - 1)) * X_standardized^T * X_standardized\n\nCov(X_standardized) = | 1.000   0.976 |\n                      | 0.976   1.000 |\n\nNext, we find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The eigenvectors represent the principal components, and the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each principal component.\n\nEigenvalues: λ1 = 1.976, λ2 = 0.024\nEigenvectors: v1 = | 0.707 |, v2 = | -0.707 |\n                     | 0.707 |      |  0.707 |\n\nThe first principal component (v1) explains the most variance (λ1 = 1.976). So, the linear combination of production quantities that result in the maximum variance across the three products is given by the first principal component:\n\nPC1 = 0.707 * Q_standardized + 0.707 * C_standardized\n\nThis linear combination will maximize the variance across the three products."
