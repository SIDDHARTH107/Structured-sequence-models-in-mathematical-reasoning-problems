    "message_2": "To find the automorphism group of this graph, we need to find all the permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relation. We can start by analyzing the structure of the graph.\n\n1. Vertices 4, 5, 6, and 7 are all leaves, meaning they have a degree of 1.\n2. Vertices 2 and 3 are connected to vertex 1 and have a degree of 3.\n\nNow, let's find the permutations that preserve the adjacency relation:\n\n1. The identity permutation (1 2 3 4 5 6 7) keeps all vertices in their original position and obviously preserves the adjacency relation.\n2. We can swap vertices 2 and 3, and also swap their respective leaves (4, 5) with (6, 7). This gives us the permutation (1 3 2 6 7 4 5).\n3. We can also swap the leaves connected to vertex 2 (4 and 5) and the leaves connected to vertex 3 (6 and 7) separately. This results in two more permutations: (1 2 3 5 4 7 6) and (1 2 3 4 5 6 7).\n4. Finally, we can combine the swaps from points 2 and 3, resulting in the permutation (1 3 2 7 6 5 4).\n\nSo, the automorphism group of this graph consists of the following permutations:\n\n1. (1 2 3 4 5 6 7)\n2. (1 3 2 6 7 4 5)\n3. (1 2 3 5 4 7 6)\n4. (1 3 2 7 6 5 4)\n\nThese are all the permutations of the vertices that preserve the adjacency relation of the graph."
