    "message_2": "To simplify the expression, we need to distribute the negative sign to the terms inside the second parentheses and then combine like terms.\n\n(3x + 2y) - (x - 4y) = 3x + 2y - x + 4y\n\nNow, combine the like terms:\n\n3x - x + 2y + 4y = 2x + 6y\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\n2x + 6y"
