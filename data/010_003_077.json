    "message_2": "Proof:\n\nSince A is a closed subset of X and X is compact, A is also compact. Let A_int denote the interior of A, which is non-empty by assumption. Choose a point x in A_int. Since x is an interior point of A, there exists an open neighborhood V of x such that V is a subset of A. \n\nNow, for each point y in A, since X is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods U_y and V_y containing x and y, respectively. Since A is compact, there exists a finite subcover of A, say {V_y1, V_y2, ..., V_yn}. Let U = U_y1 ∩ U_y2 ∩ ... ∩ U_yn. Then U is an open neighborhood of x.\n\nWe claim that A is a compact subset of U and U is disjoint from the complement of A. To see this, note that for each i = 1, 2, ..., n, U is a subset of U_yi, so U is disjoint from V_yi. Therefore, U is disjoint from the union of {V_y1, V_y2, ..., V_yn}, which covers A. Thus, U is disjoint from the complement of A.\n\nMoreover, since V is a subset of A and U is a neighborhood of x, V ∩ U is a non-empty open subset of A. Therefore, A is a compact subset of U.\n\nNow, let's consider the numerical problem:\n\nLet X be the interval [0,1] with the standard topology, and let A = {0} ∪ {1/n : n is a positive integer}. To show that A is closed, we will show that its complement is open. The complement of A in X is the set (0,1) - {1/n : n is a positive integer}. For any x in the complement of A, there exists an open interval (a, b) containing x such that a > 0 and b < 1, and there is no positive integer n such that 1/n is in (a, b). Thus, the complement of A is open, and A is closed.\n\nThe interior of A is non-empty because 0 is an interior point of A. To see this, consider the open interval (-1/2, 1/2), which is a subset of A.\n\nNow, we will find an open subset U of X such that A is a compact subset of U and U is disjoint from the complement of A. Let x = 0. For each positive integer n, let U_n = (-1/(n+1), 1/(n+1)) and V_n = (1/(n+1), 1/n). Then, U_n and V_n are disjoint open neighborhoods of x and 1/n, respectively. Let U = ⋃_{n=1}^∞ U_n. Then U is an open subset of X.\n\nSince A is a closed subset of the compact space X, A is compact. We have that A ⊆ U, and for each positive integer n, U is disjoint from V_n. Thus, U is disjoint from the complement of A, and A is a compact subset of U."
