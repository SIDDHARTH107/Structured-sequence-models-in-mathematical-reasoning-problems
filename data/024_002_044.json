    "message_2": "To find the equation of the geodesic passing through P(1,1,2) tangent to the curve defined by the intersection of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 with the plane z = 2, we will use the geodesic equations and the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nFirst, let's find the curve defined by the intersection of the surface and the plane. Setting z = 2 in the surface equation, we get:\n\n2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nNow, let's parameterize this curve using polar coordinates:\n\nx = r*cos(θ)\ny = r*sin(θ)\n\nSince 2 = x^2 + y^2, we have r^2 = 2, so r = sqrt(2). Thus, the parameterization of the curve is:\n\nx = sqrt(2)*cos(θ)\ny = sqrt(2)*sin(θ)\nz = 2\n\nNow, let's find the tangent vector to this curve at P(1,1,2). Taking the derivative of the parameterization with respect to θ, we get:\n\ndx/dθ = -sqrt(2)*sin(θ)\ndy/dθ = sqrt(2)*cos(θ)\ndz/dθ = 0\n\nAt P(1,1,2), we have x = 1 and y = 1, so cos(θ) = 1/sqrt(2) and sin(θ) = 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the tangent vector at P is:\n\nT = (-1, 1, 0)\n\nNow, let's find the geodesic equation. The geodesic equation for a surface z = f(x,y) is given by:\n\nd²x/dt² - Γ₁(x,y)*dx/dt*dy/dt = 0\nd²y/dt² - Γ₂(x,y)*dx/dt*dy/dt = 0\n\nwhere Γ₁(x,y) and Γ₂(x,y) are the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, which can be computed from the first and second partial derivatives of f(x,y). For our surface z = x^2 + y^2, we have:\n\nf_x = 2x\nf_y = 2y\nf_xx = 2\nf_yy = 2\nf_xy = 0\n\nThus, the Christoffel symbols are:\n\nΓ₁(x,y) = (f_x*f_x + f_y*f_xy)/(2*f_x) = (4x^2)/(4x) = x\nΓ₂(x,y) = (f_x*f_xy + f_y*f_y)/(2*f_y) = (4y^2)/(4y) = y\n\nNow, let's use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the geodesic equation. We want to minimize the functional:\n\nL = ∫(dx/dt + λ*dx/dθ, dy/dt + λ*dy/dθ) dt\n\nsubject to the constraint:\n\ng(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2 = 0\n\nTaking the variation of L and setting it to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\nd²x/dt² - x*dx/dt*dy/dt = 0\nd²y/dt² - y*dx/dt*dy/dt = 0\n\nNow, we can use the initial conditions at P(1,1,2) and the tangent vector T = (-1, 1, 0) to solve this system of equations. At P, we have:\n\ndx/dt = -1\ndy/dt = 1\n\nSubstituting these values into the geodesic equations, we get:\n\nd²x/dt² - 1*(-1)*1 = 0\nd²y/dt² - 1*(-1)*1 = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we find that d²x/dt² = 1 and d²y/dt² = 1. Integrating these equations with respect to t, we get:\n\nx(t) = t + C₁\ny(t) = t + C₂\n\nAt P(1,1,2), we have x(0) = 1 and y(0) = 1, so C₁ = 1 and C₂ = 1. Therefore, the geodesic equation passing through P(1,1,2) tangent to the curve defined by the intersection of the surface z = x^2 + y^2 with the plane z = 2 is:\n\nx(t) = t + 1\ny(t) = t + 1\nz(t) = (t + 1)^2 + (t + 1)^2"
