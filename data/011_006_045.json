    "message_1": "A vending machine offers 4 different candy bars for sale, each costing $1.25. A person has a $5 bill to spend on candy bars. How many different combinations of candy bars can the person buy?",
    "message_2": "Since each candy bar costs $1.25, the person can buy a total of 4 candy bars with their $5 bill ($5 รท $1.25 = 4). We need to find the number of different combinations of candy bars the person can buy.\n\nLet's use letters A, B, C, and D to represent the 4 different candy bars. The person can buy 4 candy bars in the following combinations:\n\n1. 4 of the same kind:\n   AAAA, BBBB, CCCC, DDDD (4 combinations)\n\n2. 3 of one kind and 1 of another kind:\n   AAAB, AAAC, AAAD,\n   BBBB, BBBC, BBBD,\n   CCCC, CCCC, CCCD,\n   DDDD, DDDC, DDDB (12 combinations)\n\n3. 2 of one kind and 2 of another kind:\n   AABB, AACC, AADD,\n   BBAA, BBCC, BBDD,\n   CCAA, CCBB, CCDD,\n   DDAA, DDBB, DDCC (12 combinations)\n\n4. 2 of one kind, 1 of another kind, and 1 of another kind:\n   AABC, AABD, AACD,\n   BBAC, BBAD, BBCD,\n   CCAB, CCAD, CCBD,\n   DDAB, DDAC, DDBC (12 combinations)\n\nSo, there are a total of 4 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 40 different combinations of candy bars the person can buy."
