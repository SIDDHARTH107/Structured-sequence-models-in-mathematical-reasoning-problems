    "message_2": "A cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex that, when removed along with its incident edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nIn the given graph, the cut vertices are B and E. When either of these vertices is removed along with its incident edges, the graph is split into two connected components:\n\n- Removing B: {A, D, E} and {C, F}\n- Removing E: {A, B, C} and {D, F}\n\nThe bridges in the graph are the edges (B, E) and (C, F). When either of these edges is removed, the graph is split into two connected components:\n\n- Removing (B, E): {A, B, C} and {D, E, F}\n- Removing (C, F): {A, B, C, E, D} and {F}\n\nSo, the cut vertices are B and E, and the bridges are (B, E) and (C, F)."
