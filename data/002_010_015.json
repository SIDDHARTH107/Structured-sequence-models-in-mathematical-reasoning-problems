    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of a regular polygon, simply multiply the length of one side by the number of sides. In this case, the polygon has 8 sides, and each side has a length of 6 cm.\n\nPerimeter = (Number of sides) × (Length of one side)\nPerimeter = 8 × 6 cm\nPerimeter = 48 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the polygon is 48 cm."
