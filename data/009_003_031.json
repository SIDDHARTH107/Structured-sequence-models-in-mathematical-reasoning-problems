    "message_1": "A metal bar with a length of 20 cm and a cross-sectional area of 1 cm² is heated on one end and cooled on the other end. The temperature of the heated end is held at 100°C, while the cooled end is held at 0°C. The initial temperature of the bar is 25°C. The bar has a thermal conductivity of 50 W/mK and a specific heat capacity of 500 J/kgK. Assuming the temperature is uniform across the cross-section of the bar, write the diffusion equation and determine the temperature distribution of the bar after 10 minutes, given that the density of the bar is 8000 kg/m³.",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the heat diffusion equation, also known as the heat equation, which is given by:\n\n∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²\n\nwhere T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position along the bar, and α is the thermal diffusivity, which is given by:\n\nα = k / (ρ * c)\n\nwhere k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density, and c is the specific heat capacity.\n\nFirst, let's convert the given values to SI units:\n\nLength of the bar, L = 20 cm = 0.2 m\nCross-sectional area, A = 1 cm² = 0.0001 m²\nThermal conductivity, k = 50 W/mK\nSpecific heat capacity, c = 500 J/kgK\nDensity, ρ = 8000 kg/m³\n\nNow, we can calculate the thermal diffusivity, α:\n\nα = k / (ρ * c) = 50 / (8000 * 500) = 1.25 × 10⁻⁶ m²/s\n\nNow, we need to solve the heat equation with the given boundary and initial conditions:\n\nBoundary conditions:\nT(0, t) = 100°C\nT(L, t) = 0°C\n\nInitial condition:\nT(x, 0) = 25°C\n\nTo solve the heat equation with these conditions, we can use the method of separation of variables and Fourier series. The solution will be in the form:\n\nT(x, t) = A₀ + Σ [A_n * cos(n * π * x / L) * exp(-α * (n * π / L)² * t)]\n\nwhere A₀, A_n are constants that can be determined using the boundary and initial conditions.\n\nAfter applying the initial and boundary conditions and solving for the coefficients, we get the following solution:\n\nT(x, t) = 100 - (100/L) * x + Σ [(400 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x / L) * exp(-α * (n * π / L)² * t)]\n\nNow, we can determine the temperature distribution after 10 minutes (600 seconds):\n\nT(x, 600) = 100 - (100/0.2) * x + Σ [(400 / (n * π)) * sin(n * π * x / 0.2) * exp(-1.25 × 10⁻⁶ * (n * π / 0.2)² * 600)]\n\nTo get an approximate solution, we can consider the first few terms of the series (e.g., n = 1, 2, 3). The more terms we include, the more accurate the solution will be. However, even with just a few terms, the solution should give a reasonable approximation of the temperature distribution along the bar after 10 minutes."
