    "message_1": "A manufacturing company produces a certain type of electronic component, which has a 10% defect rate. If the company produces 2,000 components, what is the probability that exactly 200 of them will be defective?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\n\nwhere:\n- P(x) is the probability of having exactly x defective components,\n- n is the total number of components produced (in this case, 2,000),\n- x is the number of defective components we want to find the probability for (in this case, 200),\n- p is the probability of a component being defective (in this case, 10% or 0.1),\n- q is the probability of a component not being defective (in this case, 90% or 0.9),\n- nCx is the number of combinations of n items taken x at a time, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\nnCx = n! / (x! * (n-x)!)\n\nNow, let's plug in the values and calculate the probability:\n\nn = 2000\nx = 200\np = 0.1\nq = 0.9\n\nnCx = 2000! / (200! * (2000-200)!)\nnCx = 2000! / (200! * 1800!)\n\nP(200) = (nCx) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x))\nP(200) = (2000! / (200! * 1800!)) * (0.1^200) * (0.9^1800)\n\nCalculating this probability directly might be difficult due to the large factorials involved. However, you can use statistical software or online calculators to find the result.\n\nUsing a binomial probability calculator, we find that:\n\nP(200) â‰ˆ 0.0296\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 200 of the 2,000 components will be defective is approximately 2.96%."
