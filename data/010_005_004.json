    "message_2": "To show that a topological space X is path-connected, we need to show that for any two points x, y in X, there exists a continuous function f: [0, 1] → X such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\nSince X has at least three points, let's denote them as x, y, and z. To show that X is path-connected, we need to show that there exists a path between any two points in X.\n\n1. We need a path between x and y: Let f be a continuous function such that f(0) = x and f(1) = y.\n\n2. We need a path between y and z: Let g be a continuous function such that g(0) = y and g(1) = z.\n\nNow, we can show that there exists a path between x and z. Define a continuous function h: [0, 1] → X as follows:\n\nh(t) = { f(2t) if 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2\n         g(2t - 1) if 1/2 ≤ t ≤ 1 }\n\nh(0) = f(0) = x, and h(1) = g(1) = z. Since f and g are continuous, h is also continuous.\n\nThus, we have shown that there exists a path between any two points in X, and X is path-connected. The minimum number of paths needed to show that X is path-connected is 2 (the paths between x and y, and between y and z)."
