    "message_2": "The Ikeda map is a discrete-time dynamical system defined by the following equation:\n\nx_{n+1} = 1 + a * (x_n * cos(t_n) - y_n * sin(t_n))\ny_{n+1} = a * (x_n * sin(t_n) + y_n * cos(t_n))\n\nwhere t_n = b - c / (1 + x_n^2 + y_n^2) and a, b, and c are parameters.\n\nTo find the Hausdorff dimension of the attractor generated by the Ikeda map at parameter values a = 0.85 and b = 0.9, we would need to perform a numerical analysis of the map, as there is no closed-form expression for the Hausdorff dimension in terms of the parameters.\n\nThis type of analysis typically involves generating a large number of points in the attractor by iterating the map and then using various techniques to estimate the Hausdorff dimension, such as box-counting or correlation dimension methods.\n\nPerforming such an analysis is beyond the scope of a text-based AI, but there are software packages and programming libraries available that can help you perform this task, such as the Fractal Dimension Calculator in MATLAB or the Fractal Analysis package in Python.\n\nIn summary, to find the Hausdorff dimension of the attractor generated by the Ikeda map at parameter values a = 0.85 and b = 0.9, you would need to perform a numerical analysis using specialized software or programming libraries."
