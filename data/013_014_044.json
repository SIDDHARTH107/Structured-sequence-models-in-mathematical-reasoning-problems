The auctioneer needs to choose a reserve price (minimum bidding price) for the auction such that it maximizes their revenue. If the reserve price is set at $60, what is the expected revenue of the auctioneer?",
    "message_2": "To find the expected revenue of the auctioneer, we need to consider the possible outcomes of the auction with a reserve price of $60.\n\n1. If the reserve price is higher than both Buyer 1 and Buyer 2's values, then the item will not be sold, and the revenue will be $0.\n2. If the reserve price is lower than or equal to Buyer 1's value but higher than Buyer 2's value, then Buyer 1 will win the auction, and the revenue will be equal to the reserve price ($60).\n3. If the reserve price is lower than or equal to both Buyer 1 and Buyer 2's values, then Buyer 2 will win the auction, and the revenue will be equal to the reserve price ($60).\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities of each outcome:\n\n1. The probability of the reserve price being higher than both Buyer 1 and Buyer 2's values is 0, as the reserve price is set at $60, which is lower than Buyer 2's value of $70.\n2. The probability of the reserve price being lower than or equal to Buyer 1's value but higher than Buyer 2's value is also 0, as the reserve price is higher than Buyer 1's value of $50.\n3. The probability of the reserve price being lower than or equal to both Buyer 1 and Buyer 2's values is 1, as the reserve price is lower than Buyer 2's value of $70.\n\nSince the only possible outcome is that Buyer 2 wins the auction, the expected revenue of the auctioneer is equal to the reserve price of $60."
