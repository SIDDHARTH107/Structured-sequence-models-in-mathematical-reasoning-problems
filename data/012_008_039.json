    "message_2": "According to Euler's formula for planar graphs, we have:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nA planar graph is a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. In a planar graph, each face must have at least 3 edges, and each edge is shared by at most 2 faces. Therefore, we have:\n\nE >= 3F/2\n\nCombining this inequality with Euler's formula, we get:\n\nV - E + F >= V - 3F/2 = 2\n\nSolving for F, we get:\n\nF <= 2V/5\n\nNow, we can use Euler's formula to find the maximum number of edges:\n\nE = V + F - 2\n\nSubstituting the inequality for F, we get:\n\nE <= V + 2V/5 - 2\n\nFor a graph with 8 vertices (V = 8), we have:\n\nE <= 8 + (2 * 8) / 5 - 2\n\nE <= 8 + 3.2 - 2\n\nE <= 9.2\n\nSince the number of edges must be an integer, the maximum number of edges for a planar graph with 8 vertices is E = 9."
