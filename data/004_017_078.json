    "message_2": "To find the arc length of the curve, we'll use the arc length formula for a function y = f(x):\n\nL = ∫[a, b] √(1 + (f'(x))^2) dx\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the function y = x^(3/2) with respect to x:\n\nf'(x) = (3/2)x^(1/2)\n\nNow, we'll plug this into the arc length formula:\n\nL = ∫[0, 16] √(1 + ((3/2)x^(1/2))^2) dx\n\nL = ∫[0, 16] √(1 + (9/4)x) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we'll use a substitution method. Let:\n\nu = 1 + (9/4)x\ndu/dx = 9/4\ndx = (4/9)du\n\nNow, we'll change the limits of integration according to the substitution:\n\nWhen x = 0:\nu = 1 + (9/4)(0) = 1\n\nWhen x = 16:\nu = 1 + (9/4)(16) = 1 + 36 = 37\n\nNow, we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\n\nL = ∫[1, 37] √(u) * (4/9) du\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nL = (4/9) * (2/3) * (u^(3/2))[1, 37]\n\nL = (8/27) * (37^(3/2) - 1^(3/2))\n\nL = (8/27) * (37 * √37 - 1)\n\nL ≈ (8/27) * 216.437\n\nL ≈ 64.131\n\nSo, the arc length of the curve y = x^(3/2) between x = 0 and x = 16 is approximately 64.131 units."
