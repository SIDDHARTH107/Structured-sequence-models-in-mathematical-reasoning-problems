    "message_1": "A sine function has a phase shift of 30 degrees to the left and an amplitude of 2. If the equation of the function is y = 2sin(2x - 30), what is the period of the function?",
    "message_2": "To find the period of the sine function, we need to look at the coefficient of the x term inside the sine function. In this case, the coefficient is 2. The general formula for the period of a sine function is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |B|\n\nwhere B is the coefficient of the x term. In this case, B = 2. So, the period of the function is:\n\nPeriod = (2π) / |2| = (2π) / 2 = π\n\nThe period of the function y = 2sin(2x - 30) is π."
