    "message_2": "Let G be a group of order 8. By the Sylow theorems, G has a subgroup of order 4. Let H be a subgroup of G with order 4. Since the order of H is a power of a prime, H is cyclic. Let a be a generator of H, so H = {e, a, a^2, a^3} where e is the identity element.\n\nNow, consider the quotient group G/H. It has order 8/4 = 2, so it is isomorphic to the cyclic group C2. Let G/H = {H, bH} where b is an element of G not in H. Since G/H is cyclic, we have G = {e, a, a^2, a^3, b, ba, ba^2, ba^3}.\n\nNow, we consider the possible orders of the element b. Since the order of G is 8, the order of b must divide 8. If the order of b is 1, then b = e, which is a contradiction. If the order of b is 2, then G is generated by elements of order 2 and 4, so G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4.\n\nIf the order of b is 4, then G is generated by elements of order 4. In this case, we have two possibilities: either b^2 = a^2 or b^2 = a^3. If b^2 = a^2, then G is isomorphic to the cyclic group C8. If b^2 = a^3, then G is isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8.\n\nTo find the isomorphism $\\phi: G \\rightarrow H$, where H is either C8, Q8, or D4, we can define the mapping as follows:\n\n1. If G is isomorphic to C8, let H = C8 and define $\\phi(a) = g$ and $\\phi(b) = g^2$, where g is a generator of C8. Then, $\\phi$ is an isomorphism from G to C8.\n\n2. If G is isomorphic to Q8, let H = Q8 and define $\\phi(a) = i$, $\\phi(a^2) = -1$, $\\phi(a^3) = -i$, $\\phi(b) = j$, $\\phi(ba) = k$, $\\phi(ba^2) = -j$, and $\\phi(ba^3) = -k$. Then, $\\phi$ is an isomorphism from G to Q8.\n\n3. If G is isomorphic to D4, let H = D4 and define $\\phi(a) = r$, $\\phi(a^2) = r^2$, $\\phi(a^3) = r^3$, $\\phi(b) = s$, $\\phi(ba) = sr$, $\\phi(ba^2) = sr^2$, and $\\phi(ba^3) = sr^3$, where r and s are the standard generators of D4. Then, $\\phi$ is an isomorphism from G to D4.\n\nIn each case, we have found an isomorphism $\\phi: G \\rightarrow H$ where H is either C8, Q8, or D4."
