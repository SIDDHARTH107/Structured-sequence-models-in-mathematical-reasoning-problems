    "message_1": "A company produces two products P1 and P2. The profit made on each unit of P1 is $4 and on P2 is $3. Each unit of P1 requires 2 hours of production time whereas each unit of P2 takes 3 hours. The company has a production capacity of 1000 hours per day. How many units of P1 and P2 should the company produce on a particular day in order to maximize its profit?",
    "message_2": "Let x be the number of units of P1 produced and y be the number of units of P2 produced. The total profit can be represented as:\n\nProfit = 4x + 3y\n\nThe production time constraint can be represented as:\n\n2x + 3y ≤ 1000\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that satisfy the constraint. We can start by solving the constraint equation for y:\n\ny ≤ (1000 - 2x) / 3\n\nNow, we need to find the integer values of x and y that maximize the profit function. We can do this by testing different values of x and calculating the corresponding values of y:\n\n1. If x = 0, y = 1000 / 3 ≈ 333 (rounded down to the nearest integer)\nProfit = 4(0) + 3(333) = 999\n\n2. If x = 1, y = (1000 - 2(1)) / 3 ≈ 332 (rounded down to the nearest integer)\nProfit = 4(1) + 3(332) = 1000\n\n3. If x = 2, y = (1000 - 2(2)) / 3 ≈ 332 (rounded down to the nearest integer)\nProfit = 4(2) + 3(332) = 1000\n\nWe can continue testing different values of x, but we can see that the profit is not increasing significantly. Therefore, we can conclude that producing 1 unit of P1 and 332 units of P2 is one of the optimal solutions to maximize the profit, resulting in a total profit of $1000."
