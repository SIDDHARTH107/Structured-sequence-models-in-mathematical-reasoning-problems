    "message_2": "An orthogonal array is a systematic way of designing experiments to test all possible combinations of factors and their levels. In this case, there are 4 factors, each with 3 levels. To find the size of the orthogonal array needed, we need to calculate the total number of possible combinations.\n\nSince there are 3 levels for each of the 4 factors, the total number of possible combinations is:\n\n3^4 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81\n\nSo, an orthogonal array of size 81 is needed to test all possible combinations of the 4 factors with 3 levels each."
