    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of Stirling numbers of the second kind. Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted by S(n, k), represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 12 objects and k = 3 non-empty subsets. So, we need to find the value of S(12, 3).\n\nThe formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind is:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nTo find S(12, 3), we need to know the values of S(11, 3), S(11, 2), S(10, 3), and S(10, 2). We can continue breaking down the formula until we reach the base cases:\n\nS(n, 1) = 1 for all n (since there's only one way to put all elements into a single subset)\nS(n, n) = 1 for all n (since there's only one way to put each element into its own subset)\nS(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0 (since there's no way to partition non-empty sets into 0 subsets)\n\nUsing the base cases and the formula, we can compute the values needed:\n\nS(10, 2) = 2 * S(9, 2) + S(9, 1) = 2 * (2 * S(8, 2) + S(8, 1)) + 1 = 2 * (2 * (2 * S(7, 2) + S(7, 1)) + 1) + 1 = 2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * S(6, 2) + S(6, 1)) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * S(5, 2) + S(5, 1)) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * S(4, 2) + S(4, 1)) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * S(3, 2) + S(3, 1)) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * S(2, 2) + S(2, 1)) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * 1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 511\n\nS(10, 3) = 3 * S(9, 3) + S(9, 2) = 3 * (3 * S(8, 3) + S(8, 2)) + 127 = 3 * (3 * (3 * S(7, 3) + S(7, 2)) + 127) + 127 = 3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * S(6, 3) + S(6, 2)) + 127) + 127) + 127 = 3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127 = 3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127 = 3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127 = 3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * 1 + 3) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127 = 3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * 10 + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127 = 3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * 157 + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127 = 3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * 610 + 127) + 127) + 127) + 127 = 3 * (3 * (3 * 1927 + 127) + 127) + 127 = 3 * (3 * 5798 + 127) + 127 = 3 * 17401 + 127 = 52204\n\nS(11, 3) = 3 * S(10, 3) + S(10, 2) = 3 * 52204 + 511 = 156612 + 511 = 157123\n\nS(12, 3) = 3 * S(11, 3) + S(11, 2) = 3 * 157123 + 2047 = 471369 + 2047 = 473416\n\nSo, there are 473416 ways to divide the set of 12 distinguishable objects into 3 non-empty subsets."
