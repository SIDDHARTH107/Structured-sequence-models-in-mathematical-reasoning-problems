    "message_2": "To find the limit of the function f(x) = (2x^2 - 5x + 1)/(x^2 - 4) as x approaches 2, we can first try to factor the numerator and denominator to see if there are any common factors that can be canceled out.\n\nThe denominator can be factored as (x - 2)(x + 2). Now let's try to factor the numerator:\n\n2x^2 - 5x + 1\n\nWe can use the \"ac method\" to factor this quadratic expression. Multiply the leading coefficient (2) by the constant term (1) to get 2. Now we need to find two numbers that multiply to 2 and add to the middle coefficient (-5). These numbers are -2 and -1.\n\nNow rewrite the middle term as the sum of these two numbers:\n\n2x^2 - 2x - 1x + 1\n\nNow factor by grouping:\n\n2x(x - 1) - 1(x - 1)\n\nNow we can factor out the common factor (x - 1):\n\n(x - 1)(2x - 1)\n\nSo the factored form of the function is:\n\nf(x) = [(x - 1)(2x - 1)]/[(x - 2)(x + 2)]\n\nNow we can see that there are no common factors to cancel out. To find the limit as x approaches 2, we can substitute 2 into the function:\n\nf(2) = [(2 - 1)(2(2) - 1)]/[(2 - 2)(2 + 2)]\n\nf(2) = [(1)(4 - 1)]/[(0)(4)]\n\nSince the denominator is 0, the limit does not exist."
