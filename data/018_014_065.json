    "message_2": "To find the Cartesian product of A and the complement of B, we first need to determine the complement of B. The complement of a set is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. Assuming the universal set U contains the elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, the complement of B is:\n\nB' = U - B = {1, 2, 3}\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian product of A and the complement of B:\n\nA × B' = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}\n\nNext, we need to find the complement of A:\n\nA' = U - A = {4, 5}\n\nNow, we can find the Cartesian product of the complement of A and the complement of B:\n\nA' × B' = {(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nTo show that the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement, we need to check if the following equation holds:\n\n(A × B') ∪ (A' × B') = (A ∪ A') × (B ∪ B')\n\nWe already found A × B' and A' × B'. Now, let's find the union of these two sets:\n\n(A × B') ∪ (A' × B') = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}\n\nNow, let's find the union of A and A':\n\nA ∪ A' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nAnd the union of B and B':\n\nB ∪ B' = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nNow, let's find the Cartesian product of (A ∪ A') and (B ∪ B'):\n\n(A ∪ A') × (B ∪ B') = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}\n\nComparing the two sets, we can see that they are not equal:\n\n(A × B') ∪ (A' × B') ≠ (A ∪ A') × (B ∪ B')\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian product of two sets is not distributive over complement."
