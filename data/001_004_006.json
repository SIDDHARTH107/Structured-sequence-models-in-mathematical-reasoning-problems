    "message_2": "To factor the quadratic polynomial 6x^2 + 13x + 5, we can use the \"ac method.\"\n\n1. Multiply the leading coefficient (a = 6) and the constant term (c = 5): ac = 6 * 5 = 30.\n\n2. Find two numbers that multiply to ac (30) and add up to the middle coefficient, b (13). These two numbers are 10 and 3, since 10 * 3 = 30 and 10 + 3 = 13.\n\n3. Rewrite the middle term (13x) as the sum of the two numbers found in step 2: 6x^2 + 10x + 3x + 5.\n\n4. Factor by grouping:\n   - Group the first two terms and the last two terms: (6x^2 + 10x) + (3x + 5).\n   - Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each group:\n     - GCF of (6x^2 + 10x) is 2x, so we have 2x(3x + 5).\n     - GCF of (3x + 5) is 1, so we have 1(3x + 5).\n\n5. Notice that both terms now have a common factor of (3x + 5). Factor this out: (3x + 5)(2x + 1).\n\nSo, the factored form of the polynomial 6x^2 + 13x + 5 is (3x + 5)(2x + 1)."
