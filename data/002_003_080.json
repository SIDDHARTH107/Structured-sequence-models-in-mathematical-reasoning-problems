    "message_2": "A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square. To find the surface area of the cube, we need to find the area of one face and then multiply it by 6.\n\nThe area of a square is found by multiplying the side length by itself. In this case, the side length is 8 cm.\n\nArea of one face = side length × side length = 8 cm × 8 cm = 64 cm²\n\nNow, we multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (6) to find the total surface area of the cube.\n\nSurface area of the cube = 6 × 64 cm² = 384 cm²\n\nThe surface area of the cube is 384 cm²."
