    "message_2": "To solve this stochastic differential equation, we will use the technique of Ito's formula. Ito's formula states that if X(t) is an Ito process and f(t, X) is a twice continuously differentiable function, then the differential of f(t, X) is given by:\n\ndf(t, X) = (∂f/∂t)dt + (∂f/∂X)dX + (1/2)(∂²f/∂X²)(dX)²\n\nNow, let's consider the function f(t, X) = ln(X). We will compute the partial derivatives:\n\n∂f/∂t = 0 (since f does not depend on t)\n∂f/∂X = 1/X\n∂²f/∂X² = -1/X²\n\nNow, we apply Ito's formula:\n\nd(ln(X(t))) = 0*dt + (1/X)dX(t) - (1/2X²)(2dW(t))²\nd(ln(X(t))) = (1/X)(3X(t)dt + 2dW(t)) - (1/2)(2²)(dt)\nd(ln(X(t))) = 3dt + (2/X)dW(t)\n\nNow, we integrate both sides from 0 to 2:\n\n∫₀² d(ln(X(t))) = ∫₀² 3dt + ∫₀² (2/X)dW(t)\nln(X(2)) - ln(X(0)) = 3∫₀² dt + 2∫₀² (1/X)dW(t)\n\nSince X(0) = 2, we have:\n\nln(X(2)) - ln(2) = 3∫₀² dt + 2∫₀² (1/X)dW(t)\n\nNow, we evaluate the integrals:\n\nln(X(2)) - ln(2) = 3(2 - 0) + 2∫₀² (1/X)dW(t)\nln(X(2)) - ln(2) = 6 + 2∫₀² (1/X)dW(t)\n\nNow, we exponentiate both sides:\n\nX(2) = 2 * exp(6 + 2∫₀² (1/X)dW(t))\n\nSince we cannot evaluate the stochastic integral ∫₀² (1/X)dW(t) analytically, we can only express the solution X(2) in terms of this integral:\n\nX(2) = 2 * exp(6 + 2∫₀² (1/X)dW(t))\n\nThis is the solution to the given stochastic differential equation."
