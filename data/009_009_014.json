    "message_2": "To find the energy of the particle, we need to use the Schrödinger equation:\n\nHψ(x) = Eψ(x)\n\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian operator, ψ(x) is the wave function, and E is the energy of the particle. The Hamiltonian operator for a particle in a potential field is given by:\n\nH = -(ħ^2 / 2m) * (d^2 / dx^2) + V(x)\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js), m is the mass of the particle, and V(x) is the potential field.\n\nFirst, let's find the second derivative of the wave function ψ(x) with respect to x:\n\nψ(x) = A sin(2x) + B cos(5x)\n\nψ'(x) = 2A cos(2x) - 5B sin(5x)\n\nψ''(x) = -4A sin(2x) - 25B cos(5x)\n\nNow, let's plug this into the Hamiltonian operator:\n\nHψ(x) = - (ħ^2 / 2m) * ψ''(x) + V(x) * ψ(x)\n\nHψ(x) = - (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)^2 / (2 * 2 kg) * (-4A sin(2x) - 25B cos(5x)) + 13x * (A sin(2x) + B cos(5x))\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nHψ(x) = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)^2 / 4 kg * (4A sin(2x) + 25B cos(5x)) + 13x * (A sin(2x) + B cos(5x))\n\nSince Hψ(x) = Eψ(x), we can equate the two expressions:\n\nE * (A sin(2x) + B cos(5x)) = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)^2 / 4 kg * (4A sin(2x) + 25B cos(5x)) + 13x * (A sin(2x) + B cos(5x))\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of sin(2x) and cos(5x) terms:\n\nE * A = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)^2 / 4 kg * 4A\nE * B = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)^2 / 4 kg * 25B\n\nNow, we can solve for E:\n\nE = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)^2 / 4 kg * 4\nE = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)^2 / 8 kg\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the energy:\n\nE = (1.0545718 × 10^(-34) Js)^2 / 8 kg\nE ≈ 1.389495 × 10^(-68) J\n\nSo, the energy of the particle is approximately 1.389495 × 10^(-68) Joules."
