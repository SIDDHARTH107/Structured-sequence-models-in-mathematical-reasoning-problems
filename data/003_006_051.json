    "message_2": "We can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side BC. The Law of Sines states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the same for all three sides of the triangle. In this case, we have:\n\nBC / sin(A) = AB / sin(B) = AC / sin(C)\n\nWe are given the length of sides AB and AC, and the measure of angle A. We can use this information to find the length of side BC.\n\nFirst, let's find the value of sin(A). Since angle A is 60 degrees:\n\nsin(A) = sin(60) = √3 / 2\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side BC:\n\nBC / ( √3 / 2 ) = 10 / sin(B)\n\nWe don't know the value of sin(B) yet, but we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:\n\nA + B + C = 180\n\nSince we know the measure of angle A (60 degrees), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nB + C = 180 - 60 = 120\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Sines again to find the value of sin(B):\n\nAC / sin(C) = 12 / sin(120 - B)\n\nSince sin(120 - B) = sin(B), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n12 / sin(B) = 10 / ( √3 / 2 )\n\nNow, we can solve for sin(B):\n\nsin(B) = (12 * ( √3 / 2 )) / 10\n\nsin(B) = (6 * √3) / 5\n\nNow that we have the value of sin(B), we can find the length of side BC:\n\nBC = 10 * ( (6 * √3) / 5 ) / ( √3 / 2 )\n\nBC = (10 * 6 * √3) / (5 * √3)\n\nBC = 60 / 5\n\nBC = 12\n\nSo, the length of side BC is 12."
