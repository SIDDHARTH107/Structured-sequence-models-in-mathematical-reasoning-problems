    "message_2": "To find the number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph G, we first need to understand some basic concepts in graph theory.\n\nA cut vertex (also known as an articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. A bridge (also known as a cut edge) is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given graph G with 7 vertices and 9 edges. Since we don't have the specific graph, we can only provide a general approach to find the cut vertices and bridges.\n\n1. Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) traversal on the graph G.\n2. During the DFS traversal, maintain a parent array to keep track of the parent of each vertex in the DFS tree.\n3. For each vertex, calculate the following values:\n   a. Discovery time (the time at which the vertex is first visited during the DFS traversal)\n   b. Low value (the minimum of the discovery time of the vertex and the low values of all its adjacent vertices, excluding its parent)\n4. A vertex is a cut vertex if:\n   a. It is the root of the DFS tree and has at least two children.\n   b. It is not the root of the DFS tree and has a child whose low value is greater than or equal to the discovery time of the vertex.\n5. An edge is a bridge if the low value of one of its endpoints is greater than the discovery time of the other endpoint.\n\nBy following these steps, you can find the number of cut vertices and bridges in the graph G. However, without the specific graph, we cannot provide the exact numbers."
