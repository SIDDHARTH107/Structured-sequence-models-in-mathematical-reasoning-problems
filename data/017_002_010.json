    "message_2": "To find all the subgroups of G, we need to find all the divisors of the order of G, which is 10. The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. For each divisor, we will find the corresponding subgroup generated by a^k, where k is the divisor.\n\n1. Subgroup of order 1: {e}\nThis subgroup contains only the identity element e. It is cyclic since it is generated by e.\n\n2. Subgroup of order 2: {e, a^5}\nThis subgroup is generated by a^5, which has order 2 since (a^5)^2 = a^10 = e. It is cyclic since it is generated by a single element a^5.\n\n3. Subgroup of order 5: {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8}\nThis subgroup is generated by a^2, which has order 5 since (a^2)^5 = a^10 = e. It is cyclic since it is generated by a single element a^2.\n\n4. Subgroup of order 10: {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9}\nThis is the entire group G, which is cyclic since it is generated by a single element a.\n\nIn summary, the subgroups of G are:\n1. {e}, cyclic\n2. {e, a^5}, cyclic\n3. {e, a^2, a^4, a^6, a^8}, cyclic\n4. {e, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6, a^7, a^8, a^9}, cyclic\n\nAll the subgroups of G are cyclic."
