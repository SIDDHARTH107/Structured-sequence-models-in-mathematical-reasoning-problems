    "message_2": "To find the lengths of the two other sides of the right triangle, we can use the sine and cosine functions of the 30-degree angle.\n\nLet's denote the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle as \"a\" and the side opposite to the 30-degree angle as \"b\".\n\nWe know that:\n\nsin(30) = b / 10\ncos(30) = a / 10\n\nWe also know that sin(30) = 1/2 and cos(30) = √3/2.\n\nNow, we can solve for a and b:\n\nb / 10 = 1/2\nb = 10 * (1/2)\nb = 5 cm\n\na / 10 = √3/2\na = 10 * (√3/2)\na = 5√3 cm\n\nSo, the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle is 5√3 cm, and the side opposite to the 30-degree angle is 5 cm."
