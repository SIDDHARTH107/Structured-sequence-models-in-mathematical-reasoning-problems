    "message_2": "The Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve can be calculated using the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension (D) = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces, and s is the scaling factor.\n\nFor the Koch curve, there are 4 self-similar pieces (each of the four smaller segments that make up the curve), and the scaling factor is 1/3 (each segment is 1/3 the length of the original line segment).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension (D) = log(4) / log(1/3) â‰ˆ 1.2619.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Koch curve is approximately 1.2619, regardless of the original line segment's length."
