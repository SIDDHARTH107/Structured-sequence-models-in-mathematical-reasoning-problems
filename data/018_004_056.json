    "message_2": "The complement of set B with respect to the universal set A, denoted as B', is the set of all elements in A that are not in B.\n\nTo find B', we can list out the elements in A that are not in B:\n\nB' = {2, 4}\n\nNow, we need to prove that B' is unique. To do this, we will show that there is only one possible complement of B with respect to A.\n\nSuppose there is another set C such that C is also a complement of B with respect to A. This means that C contains all elements in A that are not in B. Since B = {1, 3, 5}, the elements not in B are 2 and 4. Therefore, C must also contain 2 and 4.\n\nSince both B' and C contain the same elements (2 and 4), they are equal sets. Therefore, there is only one unique complement of B with respect to A, which is B' = {2, 4}."
