What is the probability that either a router or switch failure will occur in the system?",
    "message_2": "To find the probability of either a router or switch failure occurring, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\n\nwhere A is the event of a router failure, B is the event of a switch failure, and A ∩ B is the event of both a router and switch failure occurring simultaneously.\n\nP(A) = probability of a router failure = 0.05\nP(B) = probability of a switch failure = 0.02\nP(A ∩ B) = probability of both a router and switch failure = 0.01\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A ∪ B) = 0.05 + 0.02 - 0.01 = 0.06\n\nSo, the probability that either a router or switch failure will occur in the system is 0.06 or 6%."
