After conducting some market research, you have determined that the expected returns and standard deviations of each stock are as follows:\n\nCompany A: E(R) = 8%, SD(R) = 12%\nCompany B: E(R) = 12%, SD(R) = 15%\nCompany C: E(R) = 15%, SD(R) = 18%\n\nAssuming that the returns of the three stocks are independent and normally distributed, what is the optimal portfolio allocation that maximizes your expected return while keeping your portfolio standard deviation under 16%?",
    "message_2": "To find the optimal portfolio allocation, we need to solve for the weights of each stock in the portfolio that maximize the expected return while keeping the portfolio standard deviation under 16%. Let the weights of Company A, Company B, and Company C be w_A, w_B, and w_C, respectively. Since we are investing the entire $100,000, the sum of the weights must equal 1:\n\nw_A + w_B + w_C = 1\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (E(R_P)) is the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual stocks:\n\nE(R_P) = w_A * E(R_A) + w_B * E(R_B) + w_C * E(R_C)\n\nThe variance of the portfolio (Var(R_P)) is the weighted sum of the variances and covariances of the individual stocks. Since the returns of the stocks are independent, the covariances are 0:\n\nVar(R_P) = w_A^2 * Var(R_A) + w_B^2 * Var(R_B) + w_C^2 * Var(R_C)\n\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio (SD(R_P)) is the square root of the variance:\n\nSD(R_P) = sqrt(Var(R_P))\n\nWe want to maximize E(R_P) while keeping SD(R_P) under 16%. To do this, we can set up a constrained optimization problem:\n\nMaximize E(R_P) subject to:\n1. w_A + w_B + w_C = 1\n2. SD(R_P) <= 16%\n\nUsing the given expected returns and standard deviations for each stock, we can rewrite the objective function and constraints as:\n\nMaximize E(R_P) = 0.08w_A + 0.12w_B + 0.15w_C subject to:\n1. w_A + w_B + w_C = 1\n2. sqrt((0.12^2)w_A^2 + (0.15^2)w_B^2 + (0.18^2)w_C^2) <= 0.16\n\nTo solve this optimization problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the Lagrangian function L:\n\nL(w_A, w_B, w_C, λ) = 0.08w_A + 0.12w_B + 0.15w_C - λ(w_A + w_B + w_C - 1)\n\nTake the partial derivatives of L with respect to w_A, w_B, w_C, and λ, and set them equal to 0:\n\n∂L/∂w_A = 0.08 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂w_B = 0.12 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂w_C = 0.15 - λ = 0\n∂L/∂λ = w_A + w_B + w_C - 1 = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we find that λ = 0.08, 0.12, and 0.15, which implies that w_A = w_B = w_C = 1/3. This means that the optimal portfolio allocation is to invest equal amounts in each stock:\n\nw_A = 1/3\nw_B = 1/3\nw_C = 1/3\n\nHowever, we still need to check if this allocation satisfies the standard deviation constraint. Plugging these weights into the standard deviation formula, we get:\n\nSD(R_P) = sqrt((0.12^2)(1/3)^2 + (0.15^2)(1/3)^2 + (0.18^2)(1/3)^2) ≈ 0.1035\n\nSince 0.1035 < 0.16, this allocation satisfies the constraint, and it is the optimal portfolio allocation that maximizes the expected return while keeping the portfolio standard deviation under 16%."
