    "message_1": "Consider a multivariate data set with three variables X, Y, and Z. Suppose that the covariance matrix of this data set is given by:\n\n      | 10  3  -2 |  \n      | 3   6  -1 |  \nSigma =|-2  -1  5 |\n\nIf the mean of X is 2, the mean of Y is 1, and the mean of Z is 4, what is the equation of the plane that best fits the data?",
    "message_2": "To find the equation of the plane that best fits the data, we need to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the covariance matrix. PCA will give us the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, which represent the directions of the principal components and the amount of variance explained by each component, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix Sigma:\n\nSigma = | 10  3  -2 |  \n        |  3   6  -1 |  \n        | -2  -1   5 |\n\nThe characteristic equation of Sigma is given by the determinant of (Sigma - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix:\n\n| 10-λ  3    -2  |  \n|  3    6-λ  -1  | = 0\n| -2   -1    5-λ |\n\nComputing the determinant, we get the characteristic polynomial:\n\n(10-λ)((6-λ)(5-λ) - (-1)(-1)) - 3(3(5-λ) - (-1)(-2)) + (-2)(3(-1) - (-1)(-1)) = 0\n(10-λ)(30 - 11λ + λ^2 - 1) - 3(15 - 3λ - 2) + (-2)(-3 - 1) = 0\n(10-λ)(29 - 11λ + λ^2) - 3(13 - 3λ) + 8 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying the polynomial, we get:\n\nλ^3 - 21λ^2 + 130λ - 210 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvalues (λ) by solving the cubic equation. The eigenvalues are approximately:\n\nλ1 ≈ 13.732\nλ2 ≈ 6.132\nλ3 ≈ 1.136\n\nNext, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue by solving the system of linear equations (Sigma - λI)v = 0, where v is the eigenvector. The eigenvectors are (normalized to unit length):\n\nv1 ≈ (0.577, 0.577, -0.577)\nv2 ≈ (-0.408, 0.816, 0.408)\nv3 ≈ (0.707, -0.000, 0.707)\n\nThe first principal component (v1) is the direction of the largest variance in the data, and the plane that best fits the data is orthogonal to this direction. Therefore, the normal vector of the plane is given by the first principal component, v1.\n\nNow, we can find the equation of the plane using the normal vector and the mean values of X, Y, and Z:\n\n0.577(X - 2) + 0.577(Y - 1) - 0.577(Z - 4) = 0\n\nMultiplying through by 1/0.577 to simplify the equation:\n\nX - 2 + Y - 1 - (Z - 4) = 0\n\nFinally, the equation of the plane that best fits the data is:\n\nX + Y - Z + 1 = 0"
