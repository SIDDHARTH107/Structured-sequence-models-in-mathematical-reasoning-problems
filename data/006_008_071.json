    "message_1": "What is the probability of it raining on exactly two days in a given week, if historically the probability of rain on any given day is 20% and the days are independent of each other?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we will use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of exactly k successes (rainy days) in n trials (days in a week)\n- C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, also written as n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n- p is the probability of success (rain) on a single trial (day), which is 20% or 0.2\n- n is the number of trials (days in a week), which is 7\n- k is the number of successes (rainy days) we want, which is 2\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = C(7, 2) * 0.2^2 * (1-0.2)^(7-2)\n\nFirst, we calculate C(7, 2):\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!)\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2!5!)\nC(7, 2) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / (2*1*5*4*3*2*1)\nC(7, 2) = (7*6) / (2*1)\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nNow, we plug this value back into the formula:\n\nP(X = 2) = 21 * 0.2^2 * 0.8^5\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n0.2^2 = 0.04\n0.8^5 = 0.32768\n\nFinally, we multiply all the values:\n\nP(X = 2) = 21 * 0.04 * 0.32768\nP(X = 2) â‰ˆ 0.2752512\n\nSo, the probability of it raining on exactly two days in a given week is approximately 27.53%."
