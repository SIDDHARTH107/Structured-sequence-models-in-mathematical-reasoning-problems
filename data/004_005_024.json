The differential equation is:\n\ndy/dx - y = e^x\n\nFirst, we find the integrating factor, which is the exponential of the integral of the coefficient of y:\n\nIntegrating factor = e^(∫(-1)dx) = e^(-x)\n\nNow, we multiply the entire differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(-x)(dy/dx - y) = e^x * e^(-x)\n\ne^(-x)dy/dx - e^(-x)y = 1\n\nNow, we notice that the left side of the equation is the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dx(y * e^(-x)) = 1\n\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\n∫(d/dx(y * e^(-x)))dx = ∫1dx\n\ny * e^(-x) = x + C\n\nNow, we solve for y:\n\ny = e^x(x + C)\n\nTo find the constant C, we use the initial condition y(0) = 2:\n\n2 = e^(0)(0 + C)\n\n2 = C\n\nSo, the solution to the differential equation is:\n\ny(x) = e^x(x + 2)"
