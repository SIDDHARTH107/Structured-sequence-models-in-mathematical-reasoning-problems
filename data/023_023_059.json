    "message_2": "To determine the bandwidth of the network, we need to find the range of frequencies over which the power spectrum is significant. In this case, we can use the half-power bandwidth method, which means we will find the range of frequencies where the power spectrum is at least half of its maximum value.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum value of the power spectrum S(f). This occurs when the denominator is minimized, which happens when f = 0:\n\nS(0) = 4 / (25 + 4 * 0^2) = 4 / 25\n\nNow, we need to find the frequencies where the power spectrum is half of its maximum value:\n\nS(f) = (1/2) * (4 / 25)\n\nTo solve for f, we can set up the following equation:\n\n4 / (25 + 4f^2) = 2 / 25\n\nNow, we can solve for f:\n\n25 + 4f^2 = 50\n4f^2 = 25\nf^2 = 6.25\nf = ±√6.25\n\nSo, the half-power frequencies are approximately -2.5 and 2.5. Therefore, the bandwidth of the network is:\n\nBandwidth = 2.5 - (-2.5) = 5"
