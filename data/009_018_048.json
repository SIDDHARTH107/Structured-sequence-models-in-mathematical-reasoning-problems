    "message_2": "To find the equilibrium solutions, we need to set y' = 0 and y'' = 0. This will give us a system of algebraic equations to solve for the equilibrium points.\n\nLet y' = 0 and y'' = 0, then the differential equation becomes:\n\n0 + 0 - 6y + 8y^3 = 0\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n8y^3 - 6y = 0\n\nFactoring out y, we get:\n\ny(8y^2 - 6) = 0\n\nThis gives us three equilibrium solutions:\n\ny1 = 0\ny2 = sqrt(3/4)\ny3 = -sqrt(3/4)\n\nNow, we need to analyze the stability of these equilibrium solutions. To do this, we will linearize the system around each equilibrium point by finding the second derivative of the potential energy function, V(y), with respect to y.\n\nThe potential energy function, V(y), can be obtained by integrating the original differential equation:\n\nV'(y) = -y' + 6y - 8y^3\n\nIntegrating V'(y) with respect to y, we get:\n\nV(y) = âˆ«(-y' + 6y - 8y^3) dy = -1/2 * y'^2 + 3y^2 - 2y^4 + C\n\nNow, we find the second derivative of V(y) with respect to y:\n\nV''(y) = 6 - 8 * 4 * y^2 = 6 - 32y^2\n\nNow, we evaluate V''(y) at each equilibrium point:\n\nV''(y1) = 6 - 32(0)^2 = 6\nV''(y2) = 6 - 32(sqrt(3/4))^2 = -18\nV''(y3) = 6 - 32(-sqrt(3/4))^2 = -18\n\nThe stability of each equilibrium solution is determined by the sign of V''(y):\n\n- If V''(y) > 0, the equilibrium solution is stable (attracts nearby trajectories).\n- If V''(y) < 0, the equilibrium solution is unstable (repels nearby trajectories).\n\nTherefore, the stability of the equilibrium solutions is as follows:\n\ny1 = 0: stable\ny2 = sqrt(3/4): unstable\ny3 = -sqrt(3/4): unstable"
