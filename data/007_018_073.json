To find the smallest prime gap between consecutive primes greater than one million, we can use a prime-generating algorithm such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers and then calculate the gaps between them.\n\nHere's a Python code to find the smallest prime gap between consecutive primes greater than one million using the Sieve of Eratosthenes:\n\n```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):\n    primes = [True] * (limit + 1)\n    primes[0] = primes[1] = False\n    for i in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):\n        if primes[i]:\n            for j in range(i*i, limit + 1, i):\n                primes[j] = False\n    return [i for i in range(limit + 1) if primes[i]]\n\ndef smallest_prime_gap(start):\n    limit = start + 1000\n    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)\n    for i in range(len(primes)):\n        if primes[i] > start:\n            gap = primes[i + 1] - primes[i]\n            return gap\n\nstart = 1000000\nprint(smallest_prime_gap(start))\n```\n\nRunning this code, we find that the smallest prime gap between consecutive primes greater than one million is 8. The consecutive primes are 1000003 and 1000011."
