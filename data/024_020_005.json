    "message_2": "The Hopf map, denoted as h: S^3 → S^2, is a continuous map from the three-sphere (S^3) to the two-sphere (S^2). It is defined as follows:\n\nLet (z1, z2) ∈ ℂ^2 be complex coordinates on ℂ^2, and let (x, y, z) ∈ ℝ^3 be real coordinates on ℝ^3. The Hopf map h is given by:\n\nh(z1, z2) = (x, y, z)\n\nwhere\n\nx = 2 * Re(z1 * conj(z2))\ny = 2 * Im(z1 * conj(z2))\nz = |z1|^2 - |z2|^2\n\nHere, Re and Im denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively, and conj denotes the complex conjugate.\n\nThe three-sphere S^3 is defined as the locus of points in four-dimensional Euclidean space that are equidistant from the origin, i.e.,\n\nS^3 = {(z1, z2) ∈ ℂ^2 : |z1|^2 + |z2|^2 = 1}\n\nThe Hopf map h maps each point (z1, z2) on the three-sphere S^3 to a point (x, y, z) on the two-sphere S^2, which is defined as the locus of points in three-dimensional Euclidean space that are equidistant from the origin, i.e.,\n\nS^2 = {(x, y, z) ∈ ℝ^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1}\n\nBy substituting the expressions for x, y, and z in terms of z1 and z2, we can verify that the Hopf map h indeed maps points from S^3 to S^2."
