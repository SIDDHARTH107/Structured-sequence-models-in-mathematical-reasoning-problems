    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty subsets. In this case, we want to partition the set of 6 products into 3 non-empty subsets, representing the products manufactured in each of the 3 weeks.\n\nThe Stirling number of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k), can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\nS(n, k) = k * S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)\n\nUsing this recurrence relation, we can calculate S(6, 3):\n\nS(6, 3) = 3 * S(5, 3) + S(5, 2)\nS(5, 3) = 3 * S(4, 3) + S(4, 2)\nS(4, 3) = 3 * S(3, 3) + S(3, 2)\nS(3, 3) = 1 (base case)\nS(3, 2) = 3 (base case)\n\nNow, we can work our way back up:\n\nS(4, 3) = 3 * 1 + 3 = 6\nS(5, 3) = 3 * 6 + 3 = 21\nS(6, 3) = 3 * 21 + 6 = 69\n\nSo there are 69 ways to partition the 6 products into 3 non-empty subsets.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to assign the 6 products to 3 weeks. Since there are 6 products and each can be assigned to one of the 3 weeks, there are 3^6 = 729 possible assignments.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it takes 3 weeks to produce all 6 products is:\n\nP(3 weeks) = S(6, 3) / 3^6 = 69 / 729 â‰ˆ 0.0947\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 9.47%."
