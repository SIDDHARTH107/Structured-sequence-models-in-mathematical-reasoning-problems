    "message_1": "Suppose you have 8 identical balls and you want to distribute them into 4 distinct boxes such that each box contains at least 2 balls. How many ways are there to do this?",
    "message_2": "Since each of the 4 distinct boxes must contain at least 2 balls, we first place 2 balls in each box. This leaves us with no balls left to distribute. Now, we can think of this problem as distributing the remaining 0 balls into the 4 boxes, which can be solved using the stars and bars method.\n\nThe stars and bars method states that the number of ways to distribute n identical items into k distinct boxes is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+k-1, k-1), where C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).\n\nIn our case, n = 0 (the remaining balls) and k = 4 (the number of boxes). So, we have:\n\nC(n+k-1, k-1) = C(0+4-1, 4-1) = C(3, 3)\n\nNow, we calculate the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(3, 3) = 3! / (3!(3-3)!) = 3! / (3!0!) = 1 / (1) = 1\n\nSo, there is only 1 way to distribute the 8 identical balls into the 4 distinct boxes such that each box contains at least 2 balls."
