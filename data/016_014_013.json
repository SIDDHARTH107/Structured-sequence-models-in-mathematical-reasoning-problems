    "message_2": "To find the Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve, we can use the formula:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(N) / log(1/s)\n\nwhere N is the number of self-similar pieces and s is the scaling factor.\n\nIn the case of the Lévy C curve, each line segment is replaced by 4 smaller copies (N = 4), and each copy is one-third the length of the original segment (s = 1/3).\n\nSo, the Hausdorff dimension is:\n\nHausdorff dimension = log(4) / log(1/3) ≈ 1.2619\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension of the Lévy C curve is approximately 1.2619."
