    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using QR decomposition, we first need to represent the system in the matrix form Ax = b, where A is the matrix of coefficients, x is the column vector of variables, and b is the column vector of constants.\n\nA = |  2  1  3 |\n    |  4  2  2 |\n    | -2  5  1 |\n\nb = |  7  |\n    | 10  |\n    |  1  |\n\nNow, we need to perform QR decomposition on matrix A. QR decomposition is a process of decomposing a matrix A into an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R such that A = QR.\n\nUsing the Gram-Schmidt process, we can find the orthogonal matrix Q and the upper triangular matrix R.\n\n1. Normalize the first column of A:\nu1 = (2, 4, -2)\n||u1|| = √(2^2 + 4^2 + (-2)^2) = √24\nv1 = u1 / ||u1|| = (1/√6, 2/√6, -1/√6)\n\n2. Subtract the projection of the second column of A onto v1, and normalize the result:\nu2 = (1, 2, 5) - ((1, 2, 5) · v1) * v1\nu2 = (1, 2, 5) - (4/√6) * (1/√6, 2/√6, -1/√6)\nu2 = (1/3, 2/3, 14/3)\n||u2|| = √(1/9 + 4/9 + 196/9) = √(201/9)\nv2 = u2 / ||u2|| = (1/√201, 2/√201, 14/√201)\n\n3. Subtract the projection of the third column of A onto v1 and v2, and normalize the result:\nu3 = (3, 2, 1) - ((3, 2, 1) · v1) * v1 - ((3, 2, 1) · v2) * v2\nu3 = (3, 2, 1) - (11/√6) * (1/√6, 2/√6, -1/√6) - (10/√201) * (1/√201, 2/√201, 14/√201)\nu3 = (0, 0, 2)\n||u3|| = √(0^2 + 0^2 + 2^2) = 2\nv3 = u3 / ||u3|| = (0, 0, 1)\n\nNow, we have the orthogonal matrix Q:\nQ = |  1/√6  1/√201  0 |\n    |  2/√6  2/√201  0 |\n    | -1/√6 14/√201  1 |\n\nAnd the upper triangular matrix R:\nR = | √24  4/√6  11/√6  |\n    |  0   √201/3 10/√201 |\n    |  0    0      2     |\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation Rx = Q^T * b for x.\n\nQ^T * b = |  1/√6  2/√6 -1/√6 | |  7  |\n          |  1/√201 2/√201 14/√201 | | 10  |\n          |  0      0      1      | |  1  |\n\nQ^T * b = |  5/√6  |\n          | 18/√201 |\n          |  1      |\n\nNow, we can solve the upper triangular system Rx = Q^T * b using back substitution:\n\n2z = 1 => z = 1/2\n\n(√201/3)y + (10/√201)(1/2) = 18/√201 => y = 1\n\n(√24)x + (4/√6)y + (11/√6)(1/2) = 5/√6 => x = 1\n\nSo, the solution to the system of linear equations is x = 1, y = 1, and z = 1/2."
