    "message_2": "To determine the diameter of G, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. The diameter is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices in the graph.\n\nFirst, let's consider the minimum number of edges required to connect all 10 vertices in a graph. This can be achieved by creating a tree with 10 vertices. In a tree, the number of edges is always one less than the number of vertices, so we would have 9 edges in this case.\n\nNow, let's add the remaining 6 edges (15 - 9 = 6) to the graph. Adding these edges will create cycles and reduce the distance between some pairs of vertices. In the best case scenario, we can reduce the distance between the farthest pairs of vertices by adding these edges optimally.\n\nConsider the initial tree with 10 vertices and 9 edges. The longest path in this tree would be between the root and the farthest leaf, which would have a distance of 9 (since there are 9 edges). Now, let's add the 6 remaining edges.\n\n1. Add an edge between the farthest leaf and its sibling, reducing the longest path to 8.\n2. Add an edge between the farthest leaf and its grand-sibling, reducing the longest path to 7.\n3. Add an edge between the farthest leaf and its great-grand-sibling, reducing the longest path to 6.\n4. Add an edge between the farthest leaf and its great-great-grand-sibling, reducing the longest path to 5.\n5. Add an edge between the farthest leaf and its great-great-great-grand-sibling, reducing the longest path to 4.\n6. Add an edge between the farthest leaf and its great-great-great-great-grand-sibling, reducing the longest path to 3.\n\nAfter adding these 6 edges, the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph is 3. Therefore, the diameter of G is 3."
