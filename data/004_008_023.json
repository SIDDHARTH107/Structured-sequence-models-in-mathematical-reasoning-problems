    "message_2": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = 2x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x + 1 at the point where x = 2, we need to find the slope of the tangent line and the coordinates of the point on the curve.\n\nFirst, let's find the y-coordinate of the point on the curve when x = 2:\n\ny = 2(2)^3 - 5(2)^2 - 4(2) + 1\ny = 2(8) - 5(4) - 8 + 1\ny = 16 - 20 - 8 + 1\ny = -11\n\nSo, the point on the curve is (2, -11).\n\nNext, we need to find the slope of the tangent line. To do this, we'll find the derivative of the function y with respect to x:\n\ny'(x) = d(2x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x + 1)/dx\ny'(x) = 6x^2 - 10x - 4\n\nNow, we'll find the slope of the tangent line at x = 2:\n\ny'(2) = 6(2)^2 - 10(2) - 4\ny'(2) = 6(4) - 20 - 4\ny'(2) = 24 - 20 - 4\ny'(2) = 0\n\nThe slope of the tangent line is 0.\n\nNow that we have the slope and the point on the curve, we can find the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere m is the slope, and (x1, y1) is the point on the curve.\n\ny - (-11) = 0(x - 2)\ny + 11 = 0\n\nThe equation of the tangent line is y = -11."
