    "message_2": "To prove that the union of sets A and B (A ∪ B) is a superset of both Set A and Set B, we need to show that every element in Set A and Set B is also an element of A ∪ B.\n\nBy definition, the union of two sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the set containing all elements of A and all elements of B. In other words, x ∈ A ∪ B if and only if x ∈ A or x ∈ B.\n\nNow, let's consider Set A = {1, 3, 5} and Set B = {2, 4, 6}. The union of Set A and Set B is:\n\nA ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\nNow, we need to show that every element in Set A and Set B is also an element of A ∪ B.\n\nFor Set A:\n1 ∈ A and 1 ∈ A ∪ B\n3 ∈ A and 3 ∈ A ∪ B\n5 ∈ A and 5 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nFor Set B:\n2 ∈ B and 2 ∈ A ∪ B\n4 ∈ B and 4 ∈ A ∪ B\n6 ∈ B and 6 ∈ A ∪ B\n\nSince every element in Set A and Set B is also an element of A ∪ B, we can conclude that A ∪ B is a superset of both Set A and Set B."
