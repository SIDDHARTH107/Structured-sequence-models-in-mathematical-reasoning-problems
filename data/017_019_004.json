    "message_2": "To prove that a group G of order 36 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, we will first analyze the possible structures of G using the Sylow theorems. Then, we will examine each case and show that G must be isomorphic to one of the mentioned groups.\n\nRecall that the order of G is 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. By the Sylow theorems, we know the following:\n\n1. The number of 2-Sylow subgroups, n_2, divides 3^2 = 9 and is congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be either 1 or 9.\n2. The number of 3-Sylow subgroups, n_3, divides 2^2 = 4 and is congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be either 1 or 4.\n\nNow, we will examine each case:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since both subgroups are unique, they are both normal in G. Moreover, since the orders of P_2 and P_3 are coprime, their intersection is trivial. Thus, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3. Since P_2 is of order 4, it is either isomorphic to C4 or V4 (the Klein four-group). Similarly, since P_3 is of order 9, it is isomorphic to C9. Therefore, G is either isomorphic to C4 × C9 or V4 × C9. However, C4 × C9 is isomorphic to C36, so in this case, G is isomorphic to either C36 or one of the non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\nIn this case, there are nine 2-Sylow subgroups, and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup P_3 of order 9. Since P_3 is unique, it is normal in G. Let H be a 2-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, the normalizer N_G(H) has index n_2 = 9, and |N_G(H)| = 4. Since P_3 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product H ⋊ P_3. The possible structures of G in this case depend on the action of P_3 on H by conjugation. However, since P_3 is isomorphic to C9, there are only two possible actions: the trivial action and the non-trivial action. The trivial action gives the direct product H × P_3, which is covered in Case 1. The non-trivial action results in one of the non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there is a unique 2-Sylow subgroup P_2 of order 4 and four 3-Sylow subgroups. Since P_2 is unique, it is normal in G. Let K be a 3-Sylow subgroup of G. Then, the normalizer N_G(K) has index n_3 = 4, and |N_G(K)| = 9. Since P_2 is normal in G, we can form the semidirect product K ⋊ P_2. The possible structures of G in this case depend on the action of P_2 on K by conjugation. However, since P_2 is isomorphic to either C4 or V4, there are only a few possible actions. One of these actions results in the group A4 × C3, while the others result in non-abelian groups of order 36.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\nIn this case, there are nine 2-Sylow subgroups and four 3-Sylow subgroups. This case does not lead to any new group structures that were not covered in Cases 2 and 3.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a group G of order 36 must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36, depending on the number of Sylow subgroups and their actions by conjugation."
