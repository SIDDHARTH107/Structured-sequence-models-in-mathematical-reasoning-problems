    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination, we first write the augmented matrix for the given system:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & -2 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n2 & -4 & 2 & 10 \\\\\n3 & -6 & 3 & 15\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNow, we perform row operations to get the matrix in row-echelon form:\n\n1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & -2 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & -6 & 3 & 15\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n2. Subtract 3 times the first row from the third row:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|c}\n1 & -2 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form. We can see that the second and third rows are all zeros, which means that the system is dependent and has infinitely many solutions. There is no unique solution for (x, y, z) in this case."
