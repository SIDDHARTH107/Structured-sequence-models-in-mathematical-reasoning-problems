    "message_2": "To determine the convergence of the Fourier series for the function f(x) = x on the interval [-π, π], we first need to find the Fourier coefficients. The Fourier series of a function f(x) can be represented as:\n\nf(x) = a_0 + Σ [a_n * cos(nx) + b_n * sin(nx)]\n\nwhere a_0, a_n, and b_n are the Fourier coefficients, and n is an integer.\n\nFor the given function f(x) = x, we can find the coefficients using the following formulas:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x dx\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(nx) dx\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\n\nCalculating a_0:\n\na_0 = (1/π) * [x^2/2] | (-π, π)\na_0 = (1/π) * [(π^2/2) - (-π^2/2)]\na_0 = 0\n\nCalculating a_n:\n\na_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * cos(nx) dx\nSince f(x) is an odd function and cos(nx) is an even function, their product is an odd function. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval is zero. Therefore, a_n = 0 for all n.\n\nCalculating b_n:\n\nb_n = (1/π) * ∫[-π, π] x * sin(nx) dx\nUsing integration by parts, let u = x and dv = sin(nx) dx. Then, du = dx and v = (-1/n) * cos(nx).\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-x/n) * cos(nx) * sin(nx) | (-π, π) + (1/n) * ∫[-π, π] cos(nx) dx]\nThe second term in the expression is zero since the integral of an even function (cos(nx)) over a symmetric interval is zero.\n\nb_n = (1/π) * [(-π/n) * cos(nπ) - (-(-π/n) * cos(-nπ))]\nb_n = (1/π) * (-2π/n) * (-1)^n\n\nSo, the Fourier series for f(x) = x is:\n\nf(x) = Σ [(-2/n) * (-1)^n * sin(nx)]\n\nNow, we need to check the convergence of this Fourier series. According to the Dirichlet's theorem, a Fourier series converges to the function f(x) at every point x where f(x) is continuous and to the average of the left and right limits at the points of discontinuity.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = x is continuous on the interval [-π, π], so the Fourier series converges to the function f(x) = x on this interval."
