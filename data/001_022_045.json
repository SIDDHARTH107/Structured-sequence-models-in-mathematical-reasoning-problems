    "message_2": "To find the x-intercepts, we need to set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = x^3 + 2x^2 - 3x - 4\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots can be challenging. However, we can try to find integer roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-4) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). So, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, and ±4. We can test these values:\n\nFor x = 1: 1^3 + 2(1)^2 - 3(1) - 4 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 4 = -4\nFor x = -1: (-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 - 3(-1) - 4 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 4 = 0\n\nSo, x = -1 is a root. We can now perform synthetic division to find the remaining quadratic factor:\n\n       ______________________\n-1  |  1    2    -3    -4\n         -1    -1     4\n       ______________________\n       1    1    -4     0\n\nThe remaining quadratic factor is x^2 + x - 4. We can use the quadratic formula to find the other roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nx = (-(1) ± √((1)^2 - 4(1)(-4))) / 2(1)\nx = (-1 ± √17) / 2\n\nSo, the x-intercepts are x = -1, x = (-1 + √17) / 2, and x = (-1 - √17) / 2.\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we set x = 0:\n\ny = (0)^3 + 2(0)^2 - 3(0) - 4\ny = -4\n\nSo, the y-intercept is y = -4.\n\nTo find the turning points, we need to find the critical points where the first derivative is zero or undefined. First, let's find the first derivative of the function:\n\ny' = 3x^2 + 4x - 3\n\nNow, we set y' = 0 and solve for x:\n\n0 = 3x^2 + 4x - 3\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nx = (-(4) ± √((4)^2 - 4(3)(-3))) / 2(3)\nx = (-4 ± √52) / 6\n\nSo, the turning points occur at x = (-4 + √52) / 6 and x = (-4 - √52) / 6. To find the corresponding y-values, plug these x-values back into the original equation:\n\ny = ((-4 + √52) / 6)^3 + 2((-4 + √52) / 6)^2 - 3((-4 + √52) / 6) - 4\ny = ((-4 - √52) / 6)^3 + 2((-4 - √52) / 6)^2 - 3((-4 - √52) / 6) - 4\n\nSo, the turning points are at (-4 + √52) / 6, y1) and (-4 - √52) / 6, y2).\n\nIn summary:\n\nx-intercepts: x = -1, x = (-1 + √17) / 2, and x = (-1 - √17) / 2\ny-intercept: y = -4\nTurning points: (-4 + √52) / 6, y1) and (-4 - √52) / 6, y2)\n\nTo graph the function, plot the x-intercepts, y-intercept, and turning points, and sketch a smooth curve that passes through these points and has the correct end behavior for a cubic function (as x → ±∞, y → ±∞)."
