    "message_2": "To differentiate the function f(x) = sin(3x^2 + 2x) using the chain rule, we first identify the outer function and the inner function. In this case, the outer function is sin(u) and the inner function is u = 3x^2 + 2x.\n\nNow, we differentiate both functions:\n\nOuter function: The derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u).\nInner function: The derivative of 3x^2 + 2x with respect to x is 6x + 2.\n\nNext, we apply the chain rule, which states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. In this case, we have:\n\nf'(x) = (cos(u)) * (6x + 2)\n\nSince u = 3x^2 + 2x, we substitute it back into the expression:\n\nf'(x) = cos(3x^2 + 2x) * (6x + 2)\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) = sin(3x^2 + 2x) is f'(x) = cos(3x^2 + 2x) * (6x + 2)."
