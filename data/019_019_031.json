    "message_2": "A Turing machine with 2 tape symbols (0 and 1) and 4 states can compute a finite number of functions. However, there is no smallest natural number that cannot be computed by such a Turing machine because for any natural number N, we can always construct a Turing machine that computes N+1.\n\nTo be more specific, a Turing machine with 2 tape symbols and 4 states can have a total of 2^(2*4*5) = 2^40 different configurations, which means it can compute a finite number of functions. However, there are infinitely many natural numbers, so there will always be natural numbers that cannot be computed by a Turing machine with these limitations. But there is no smallest such number because we can always construct a Turing machine that computes a larger number."
