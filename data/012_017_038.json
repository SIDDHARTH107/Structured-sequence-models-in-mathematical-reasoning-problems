    "message_2": "To determine the maximum number of perfect matchings in a graph G where each vertex has degree 3, we can use the concept of the Petersen graph. The Petersen graph is a well-known graph in graph theory with 10 vertices and 15 edges, where each vertex has degree 3. It is known to have the maximum number of perfect matchings for a cubic graph (a graph where each vertex has degree 3).\n\nThe Petersen graph has 6 perfect matchings. Therefore, the maximum number of perfect matchings that a graph G with each vertex having degree 3 can have is 6."
