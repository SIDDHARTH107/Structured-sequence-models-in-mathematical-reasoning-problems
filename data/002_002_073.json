    "message_2": "The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)πr^3\n\nwhere V is the volume, r is the radius, and π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.\n\nGiven a radius of 5 centimeters:\n\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * (5^3)\nV = (4/3) * 3.14159 * 125\nV = 1.33333 * 3.14159 * 125\nV ≈ 523.59878\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the volume of the sphere is approximately 523.60 cubic centimeters."
