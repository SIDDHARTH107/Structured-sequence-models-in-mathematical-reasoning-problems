    "message_1": "A trapezium has a length of one of its parallel sides as 6 cm, the length of the other parallel side as 10 cm, and the height (the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides) is 4 cm. Find the perimeter of the trapezium in cm.",
    "message_2": "To find the perimeter of the trapezium, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides (the non-parallel sides). Let's call these sides a and b.\n\nWe can use the properties of trapezoids to find the lengths of these sides. Since the trapezoid is not necessarily an isosceles trapezoid, we cannot assume that the non-parallel sides are equal in length. However, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of these sides if we can determine the lengths of the legs of the right triangles formed by dropping perpendiculars from the vertices of the shorter parallel side to the longer parallel side.\n\nLet's call the trapezium ABCD, where AB is the shorter parallel side (6 cm), CD is the longer parallel side (10 cm), and AD and BC are the non-parallel sides. Drop perpendiculars from A and B to CD, meeting CD at points E and F, respectively.\n\nNow, we have two right triangles: AED and BFC. The height of the trapezium (4 cm) is the length of the legs AE and BF. Let's call the lengths of the other legs ED and FC as x and y, respectively. Since the total length of CD is 10 cm, we have:\n\nx + y = 10\n\nWe can now use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the non-parallel sides a and b:\n\na^2 = (x^2 + (4^2))\nb^2 = (y^2 + (4^2))\n\nUnfortunately, without more information, we cannot find the exact lengths of a and b. However, we can express the perimeter of the trapezium in terms of x and y:\n\nPerimeter = AB + BC + CD + DA\nPerimeter = 6 + b + 10 + a\nPerimeter = 16 + sqrt(x^2 + 16) + sqrt(y^2 + 16)\n\nThis is the expression for the perimeter of the trapezium in terms of x and y."
