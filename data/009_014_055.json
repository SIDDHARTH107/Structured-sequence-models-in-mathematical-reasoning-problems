    "message_1": "A population of rabbits increases according to the logistic growth model with a carrying capacity of 5000. If the initial population is 1000 and the growth rate is 0.2, find the population after 2 years.",
    "message_2": "The logistic growth model is given by the formula:\n\nP(t) = K / (1 + (K - P0) * e^(-r*t) / P0)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in years.\n\nIn this problem, we have K = 5000, P0 = 1000, r = 0.2, and t = 2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(2) = 5000 / (1 + (5000 - 1000) * e^(-0.2*2) / 1000)\n\nP(2) = 5000 / (1 + 4000 * e^(-0.4) / 1000)\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of e^(-0.4) and then solve for P(2):\n\ne^(-0.4) ≈ 0.67032\n\nP(2) = 5000 / (1 + 4000 * 0.67032 / 1000)\n\nP(2) = 5000 / (1 + 2.68128)\n\nP(2) = 5000 / 3.68128\n\nP(2) ≈ 1358.49\n\nAfter 2 years, the population of rabbits will be approximately 1358."
