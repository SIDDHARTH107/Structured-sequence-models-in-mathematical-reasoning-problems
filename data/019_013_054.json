    "message_2": "To find the number of subsets of a set with 10 elements, we can use the formula for the power set, which is 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the set. In this case, n = 10.\n\n2^10 = 1024\n\nSo, there are 1024 subsets of a set with 10 elements. Note that this answer is derived using basic combinatorics and not specifically second-order logic. However, second-order logic can be used to reason about sets and their properties, but the calculation of the number of subsets remains the same."
