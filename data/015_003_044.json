    "message_2": "The bifurcation diagram of the logistic map equation displays a window of chaotic behavior between r=3.6 and r=4. This means that the parameter r can take any value within this range (3.6 ≤ r ≤ 4) to exhibit chaotic behavior. There isn't a single specific value for r, but rather a range of values that lead to chaotic behavior in the logistic map."
