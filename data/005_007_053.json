The data collected are shown below:\n\nHours studied: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nTest scores: 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90\n\nWhat is the correlation coefficient between hours studied and test scores?",
    "message_2": "To find the correlation coefficient (r), we will use the following formula:\n\nr = [n(Σ(xy) - (Σx)(Σy)] / sqrt([nΣ(x^2) - (Σx)^2][nΣ(y^2) - (Σy)^2])\n\nwhere n is the number of data points, Σx is the sum of x values (hours studied), Σy is the sum of y values (test scores), Σ(xy) is the sum of the product of x and y values, Σ(x^2) is the sum of the square of x values, and Σ(y^2) is the sum of the square of y values.\n\nFirst, let's find the necessary sums:\n\nΣx = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55\nΣy = 40 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 60 + 65 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90 = 715\nΣ(xy) = (0*40) + (1*45) + (2*50) + (3*55) + (4*60) + (5*65) + (6*70) + (7*75) + (8*80) + (9*85) + (10*90) = 3025\nΣ(x^2) = 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 = 385\nΣ(y^2) = 40^2 + 45^2 + 50^2 + 55^2 + 60^2 + 65^2 + 70^2 + 75^2 + 80^2 + 85^2 + 90^2 = 48935\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nn = 11 (since there are 11 data points)\n\nr = [11(3025) - (55)(715)] / sqrt([11(385) - (55)^2][11(48935) - (715)^2])\nr = [33275 - 39325] / sqrt([4235 - 3025][538285 - 510225])\nr = [-6050] / sqrt([1210][28060])\nr = -6050 / sqrt(33991600)\nr = -6050 / 5825\n\nr = -1\n\nThe correlation coefficient between hours studied and test scores is -1, which indicates a perfect negative linear relationship. However, this result is incorrect based on the given data, as the relationship between hours studied and test scores should be positive. There might be a mistake in the calculation or the given data. Let's reevaluate the data:\n\nHours studied: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nTest scores: 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90\n\nThe data shows a perfect positive linear relationship, as the test scores increase by 5 for every additional hour studied. In this case, the correlation coefficient should be 1, not -1. The previous calculation must have had an error."
