    "message_2": "To find the number of ways the 7 people can stand in the line, we need to calculate the number of permutations of 7 elements. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nn! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1\n\nwhere n is the number of elements (in this case, 7 people).\n\n7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040\n\nSo, there are 5040 different ways the 7 people can stand in the line."
