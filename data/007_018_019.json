    "message_2": "A prime gap is the difference between two consecutive prime numbers. To find the smallest prime gap greater than 100, we need to find two consecutive prime numbers whose difference is greater than 100.\n\nThe smallest prime gap greater than 100 occurs between the prime numbers 370261 and 370373. The difference between these two prime numbers is:\n\n370373 - 370261 = 112\n\nSo, the smallest prime gap greater than 100 is 112."
