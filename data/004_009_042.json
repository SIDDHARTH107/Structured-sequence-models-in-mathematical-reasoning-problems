    "message_2": "To find the derivative of f(x) using the product rule, we need to take the derivative of each part of the function and then combine them. Let's call the first part of the function g(x) = x^2 + 3x and the second part h(x) = 2x - 5.\n\nFirst, we find the derivatives of g(x) and h(x):\n\ng'(x) = d/dx (x^2 + 3x) = 2x + 3\nh'(x) = d/dx (2x - 5) = 2\n\nNow, we apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function:\n\nf'(x) = g'(x) * h(x) + g(x) * h'(x)\n\nf'(x) = (2x + 3) * (2x - 5) + (x^2 + 3x) * 2\n\nNow, we expand and simplify:\n\nf'(x) = 4x^2 - 10x + 6x - 15 + 2x^2 + 6x\nf'(x) = 4x^2 + 2x^2 + (-10x + 6x + 6x) - 15\nf'(x) = 6x^2 + 2x - 15\n\nSo, the derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 6x^2 + 2x - 15."
