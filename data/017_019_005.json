    "message_2": "To classify the groups of order 36, we first note that 36 = 2^2 * 3^2. We will use the Sylow theorems to analyze the possible Sylow subgroups and their structure.\n\nLet G be a group of order 36. By Sylow's first theorem, G has Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 and Sylow 3-subgroups of order 9.\n\n1. Sylow 2-subgroups:\n\nBy Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, n_2, must divide 9 and be congruent to 1 mod 2. Thus, n_2 can be 1 or 9. If n_2 = 1, then there is a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 2-subgroup, which we denote by P_2.\n\n2. Sylow 3-subgroups:\n\nSimilarly, by Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n_3, must divide 4 and be congruent to 1 mod 3. Thus, n_3 can be 1 or 4. If n_3 = 1, then there is a unique (and hence normal) Sylow 3-subgroup, which we denote by P_3.\n\nNow, we consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 1\n\nIn this case, both P_2 and P_3 are normal in G. Since |P_2| and |P_3| are coprime, G is isomorphic to the direct product P_2 × P_3 by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem. P_2 is isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2, and P_3 is isomorphic to C9 or C3 × C3. This gives us four abelian groups: C36, C4 × C9, C2 × C2 × C9, and C2 × C2 × C3 × C3.\n\nCase 2: n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 4\n\nIn this case, P_2 is normal in G, but P_3 is not. Since P_2 is isomorphic to either C4 or C2 × C2, we have two possibilities for the structure of G:\n\n- G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3, where P_2 ≅ C4 and P_3 ≅ C9. There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from P_3 to Aut(P_2), so we obtain one non-abelian group in this case.\n\n- G is a semidirect product of P_2 and P_3, where P_2 ≅ C2 × C2 and P_3 ≅ C9. There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from P_3 to Aut(P_2), so we obtain two non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 3: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 1\n\nIn this case, P_3 is normal in G, but P_2 is not. Since P_3 is isomorphic to either C9 or C3 × C3, we have two possibilities for the structure of G:\n\n- G is a semidirect product of P_3 and P_2, where P_3 ≅ C9 and P_2 ≅ C4. There is only one non-trivial homomorphism from P_2 to Aut(P_3), so we obtain one non-abelian group in this case.\n\n- G is a semidirect product of P_3 and P_2, where P_3 ≅ C3 × C3 and P_2 ≅ C4. There are three non-trivial homomorphisms from P_2 to Aut(P_3), so we obtain three non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nCase 4: n_2 = 9 and n_3 = 4\n\nIn this case, neither P_2 nor P_3 is normal in G. We have one possibility for the structure of G:\n\n- G is a semidirect product of P_3 and P_2, where P_3 ≅ C3 × C3 and P_2 ≅ C2 × C2. There are two non-trivial homomorphisms from P_2 to Aut(P_3), so we obtain two non-abelian groups in this case.\n\nIn total, we have found 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 9 non-abelian groups of order 36. Thus, every group of order 36 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group C36, the alternating group A4 × C3, or one of the nine non-abelian groups of order 36."
