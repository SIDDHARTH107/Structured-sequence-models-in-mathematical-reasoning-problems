    "message_2": "To express the transitivity property of a typical first-order binary relation using a second-order formula, you only need one second-order binary relation symbol.\n\nThe transitivity property states that if a relation R holds between elements a and b, and between elements b and c, then it must also hold between elements a and c. In other words, if R(a, b) and R(b, c), then R(a, c).\n\nA second-order formula that expresses this property can be written as:\n\n∀R [Transitive(R) ↔ ∀a ∀b ∀c ((R(a, b) ∧ R(b, c)) → R(a, c))],\n\nwhere Transitive(R) is a second-order predicate that expresses the transitivity property of the first-order binary relation R. In this formula, only one second-order binary relation symbol, Transitive, is needed."
