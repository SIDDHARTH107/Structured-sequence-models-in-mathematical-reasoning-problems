    "message_1": "If the Dragon curve is constructed by starting with a line segment of length 1 and iteratively replacing each line segment with a zigzag pattern formed by connecting two line segments of length 1 at right angles to each other, what is the total length of the curve after 10 iterations?",
    "message_2": "The total length of the Dragon curve after n iterations can be calculated using the formula:\n\nLength = (2^n) * (initial length)\n\nIn this case, the initial length is 1, and we want to find the length after 10 iterations. So, we have:\n\nLength = (2^10) * 1\nLength = 1024\n\nTherefore, the total length of the Dragon curve after 10 iterations is 1024."
