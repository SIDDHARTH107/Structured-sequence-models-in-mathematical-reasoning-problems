    "message_2": "To show that $G$ is a subgroup of $E(\\mathbb{Q})$, we need to verify that the points in $G$ satisfy the group axioms:\n\n1. Closure: The sum of any two points in $G$ is also in $G$.\n2. Associativity: This is inherited from the elliptic curve group law.\n3. Identity: The point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$ is the identity element.\n4. Inverses: Each point in $G$ has an inverse in $G$.\n\nFirst, let's check that the points in $G$ are on the elliptic curve $E$. We plug the $x$ and $y$ coordinates into the equation $y^2 = x^3 + 7x + 10$:\n\nFor $(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{3}{4})$:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 + 7\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 10\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{7}{2} + 10\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{9}{16}\n$$\n\nFor $(\\frac{23}{16}, -\\frac{313}{64})$:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{313}{64}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{23}{16}\\right)^3 + 7\\left(\\frac{23}{16}\\right) + 10\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{97969}{4096} = \\frac{12167}{4096} + \\frac{161}{16} + 10\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{97969}{4096} = \\frac{97969}{4096}\n$$\n\nFor $(-\\frac{5}{2}, -\\frac{11}{4})$:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{11}{4}\\right)^2 = \\left(-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^3 + 7\\left(-\\frac{5}{2}\\right) + 10\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{121}{16} = \\frac{-125}{8} + \\frac{-35}{2} + 10\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{121}{16} = \\frac{121}{16}\n$$\n\nNow, we need to check the closure property. We will use the elliptic curve addition formula to compute the sum of each pair of points in $G$:\n\n1. $(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{3}{4}) + (\\frac{23}{16}, -\\frac{313}{64}) = (-\\frac{5}{2}, -\\frac{11}{4})$\n2. $(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{3}{4}) + (-\\frac{5}{2}, -\\frac{11}{4}) = (\\frac{23}{16}, -\\frac{313}{64})$\n3. $(\\frac{23}{16}, -\\frac{313}{64}) + (-\\frac{5}{2}, -\\frac{11}{4}) = (\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{3}{4})$\n\nAll the sums are in $G$, so the closure property holds.\n\nThe associativity property is inherited from the elliptic curve group law, and the identity element is given by the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nFinally, we need to check the inverses. The inverse of a point $(x, y)$ on an elliptic curve is given by $(x, -y)$. So, we have:\n\n1. Inverse of $(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{3}{4})$ is $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4})$. Since $(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{3}{4}) + (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}) = \\mathcal{O}$, the inverse is in $G$.\n2. Inverse of $(\\frac{23}{16}, -\\frac{313}{64})$ is $(\\frac{23}{16}, \\frac{313}{64})$. Since $(\\frac{23}{16}, -\\frac{313}{64}) + (\\frac{23}{16}, \\frac{313}{64}) = \\mathcal{O}$, the inverse is in $G$.\n3. Inverse of $(-\\frac{5}{2}, -\\frac{11}{4})$ is $(-\\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{11}{4})$. Since $(-\\frac{5}{2}, -\\frac{11}{4}) + (-\\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{11}{4}) = \\mathcal{O}$, the inverse is in $G$.\n\nSince all the group axioms are satisfied, $G$ is a subgroup of $E(\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nNow, we need to compute the rank of $G$. Since $G$ has only 4 elements, it is a finite group, and its rank is 0.\n\nFinally, we need to find a basis for the torsion subgroup of $G$. The torsion subgroup of $G$ is just $G$ itself, since all elements have finite order. So, a basis for the torsion subgroup is given by the non-identity elements of $G$:\n\n$$\n\\left\\lbrace \\left(\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{3}{4}\\right),\\left(\\frac{23}{16},-\\frac{313}{64}\\right),\\left(-\\frac{5}{2},-\\frac{11}{4}\\right) \\right\\rbrace\n$$"
