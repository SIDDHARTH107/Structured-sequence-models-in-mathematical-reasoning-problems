    "message_2": "To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we will use the elimination method. First, let's multiply the first equation by a suitable number so that the coefficients of y in both equations become equal.\n\nWe can multiply the first equation by (0.9 / 3.6) to make the coefficients of y equal:\n\n(0.9 / 3.6) * (2.4x + 3.6y) = (0.9 / 3.6) * 11.8\n0.6x + 0.9y = 2.95\n\nNow we have the two equations:\n\n1) 0.6x + 0.9y = 2.95\n2) 4.3x - 0.9y = 6.1\n\nAdd equation 1 and equation 2 to eliminate y:\n\n(0.6x + 0.9y) + (4.3x - 0.9y) = 2.95 + 6.1\n0.6x + 4.3x = 9.05\n4.9x = 9.05\n\nNow, divide by 4.9 to solve for x:\n\nx = 9.05 / 4.9\nx ≈ 1.8469387755\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into either equation to solve for y. We will use equation 1:\n\n0.6x + 0.9y = 2.95\n0.6(1.8469387755) + 0.9y = 2.95\n1.1081632653 + 0.9y = 2.95\n\nSubtract 1.1081632653 from both sides:\n\n0.9y = 1.8418367347\n\nNow, divide by 0.9 to solve for y:\n\ny = 1.8418367347 / 0.9\ny ≈ 2.0464852608\n\nConsidering the error tolerance of ±0.2 in each coefficient, the solution to the system of linear equations is approximately:\n\nx ≈ 1.85\ny ≈ 2.05"
