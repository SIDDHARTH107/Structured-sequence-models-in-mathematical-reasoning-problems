    "message_2": "To find the surface area of a level 3 Menger Sponge, we need to consider the surface area of each level and the number of cubes in each level.\n\nLevel 1 Menger Sponge:\n- Surface area of each small cube: 6\n- Number of cubes: 20 (since 8 corner cubes and 12 edge cubes are solid)\n\nLevel 2 Menger Sponge:\n- Each small cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes, but only 20 of them contribute to the surface area (similar to level 1)\n- Surface area of each smaller cube: 6 / 9 (since each side is divided into 3 equal parts)\n- Number of cubes: 20 * 20 (since each of the 20 cubes in level 1 is replaced by 20 smaller cubes)\n\nLevel 3 Menger Sponge:\n- Each small cube from level 2 is divided into 27 even smaller cubes, but only 20 of them contribute to the surface area\n- Surface area of each even smaller cube: (6 / 9) / 9 (since each side is divided into 3 equal parts again)\n- Number of cubes: 20 * 20 * 20 (since each of the 20 * 20 cubes in level 2 is replaced by 20 even smaller cubes)\n\nNow, we can calculate the surface area of a level 3 Menger Sponge:\n\nSurface area = (surface area of each even smaller cube) * (number of cubes)\nSurface area = ((6 / 9) / 9) * (20 * 20 * 20)\nSurface area = (2/3) * (8000)\nSurface area = 16000/3\n\nSo, the surface area of a level 3 Menger Sponge is 16000/3 square units."
