Take $c = 2$ and assume that $u(x,t)$ and its partial derivatives are well-behaved.",
    "message_2": "To solve the given partial differential equation using the Fourier transform, we first take the Fourier transform of both sides of the equation with respect to x:\n\n$\\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}\\right\\} - c^2 \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\right\\} = 0$\n\nLet $U(k,t) = \\mathcal{F}\\{u(x,t)\\}$, then we have:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial t^2} - c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial k^2} = 0$\n\nThis is an ordinary differential equation in terms of $U(k,t)$. We can solve it by assuming a solution of the form:\n\n$U(k,t) = A(k)e^{ckt} + B(k)e^{-ckt}$\n\nNow we need to apply the initial conditions. Taking the inverse Fourier transform of $U(k,0)$, we get:\n\n$u(x,0) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{A(k)e^{0} + B(k)e^{0}\\} = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{A(k) + B(k)\\} = f(x) = x$\n\nTaking the inverse Fourier transform of $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t}(k,0)$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{cA(k) - cB(k)\\} = g(x) = 0$\n\nNow we need to find $A(k)$ and $B(k)$. Since $f(x) = x$, we can compute its Fourier transform:\n\n$F(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{x\\} = \\frac{-i}{2\\pi k^2}$\n\nSince $g(x) = 0$, we can compute its Fourier transform:\n\n$G(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\{g(x)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{0\\} = 0$\n\nNow we can use these results to find $A(k)$ and $B(k)$:\n\n$A(k) + B(k) = \\frac{-i}{2\\pi k^2}$\n\n$cA(k) - cB(k) = 0$\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n$A(k) = \\frac{-i}{4\\pi k^2}$\n\n$B(k) = \\frac{-i}{4\\pi k^2}$\n\nNow we can substitute these values back into the expression for $U(k,t)$:\n\n$U(k,t) = \\frac{-i}{4\\pi k^2}(e^{2kt} + e^{-2kt})$\n\nFinally, we take the inverse Fourier transform of $U(k,t)$ to find the solution $u(x,t)$:\n\n$u(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{-i}{4\\pi k^2}(e^{2kt} + e^{-2kt})\\right\\}$\n\nThis is the solution to the given partial differential equation with the specified initial conditions."
