    "message_1": "Suppose you have 4 identical red beads, 3 identical blue beads, and 2 identical green beads. How many unique necklaces can you make by stringing together all the beads and rotating the necklace?",
    "message_2": "To solve this problem, we can use the Polya Enumeration Theorem (PET), which is a combinatorial method to count the number of unique necklaces that can be formed.\n\nFirst, let's find the cycle index of the necklace group. For a necklace with n beads, there are n rotations. We need to find the number of cycles for each rotation and divide by n.\n\nFor a necklace with 9 beads (4 red, 3 blue, and 2 green), the cycle index is:\n\nP(n) = (1/n) * Î£(a^gcd(n,k)), where the sum is taken over all k from 0 to n-1, a is the number of beads, and gcd(n,k) is the greatest common divisor of n and k.\n\nP(9) = (1/9) * (a^9 + 3a^3 + 3a^3 + 2a^1)\nP(9) = (1/9) * (a^9 + 6a^3 + 2a^1)\n\nNow, we substitute the number of beads of each color into the cycle index:\n\nP(9) = (1/9) * ((4+3+2)^9 + 6(4^3 + 3^3 + 2^3) + 2(4+3+2))\nP(9) = (1/9) * ((9)^9 + 6(64 + 27 + 8) + 2(9))\nP(9) = (1/9) * (387420489 + 6(99) + 18)\nP(9) = (1/9) * (387420489 + 594 + 18)\nP(9) = (1/9) * 387421101\n\nNow, we divide by 9:\n\nP(9) = 43046789\n\nSo, there are 43,046,789 unique necklaces that can be made by stringing together all the beads and rotating the necklace."
