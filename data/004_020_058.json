    "message_1": "Sure, here's a precise numerical problem for the math student to solve:\n\nA force of 20 Newtons acts on an object, displacing it a distance of 5 meters in the direction of the force. Find the work done by the force using integration.",
    "message_2": "To find the work done by the force using integration, we can use the formula:\n\nWork = ∫(F * dx) from x=0 to x=5\n\nwhere F is the force (20 Newtons) and dx is the displacement in the x-direction.\n\nSince the force is constant, we can write the integral as:\n\nWork = ∫(20 dx) from x=0 to x=5\n\nNow, we can integrate:\n\nWork = [20x] from x=0 to x=5\n\nEvaluate the integral at the limits:\n\nWork = (20 * 5) - (20 * 0)\nWork = 100 - 0\nWork = 100 Joules\n\nSo, the work done by the force is 100 Joules."
